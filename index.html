<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic</h2><p><p><b>Discover your own deep well of wisdom in <i>Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic</i>&#x2015;from one of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century.</b> </p><p>Intuition deals with the difference between the intellectual, logical mind and the more encompassing realm of spirit. Logic is how the mind knows reality, intuition is how the spirit experiences reality. Osho&#x2019;s discussion of these matters is wonderfully lucid, occasionally funny, and thoroughly engrossing.</p><p>All people have a natural capacity for intuition, but often social conditioning and formal education work against it. People are taught to ignore their instincts rather than to understand and use them as a foundation for individual growth and development&#x2015;and in the process they undermine the very roots of the innate wisdom that is meant to flower into intuition. </p><p>In this volume, Osho pinpoints exactly what intuition is and gives guidelines for how to identify its functioning in others and ourselves. You will learn to distinguish between genuine intuitive insight and the &#x201c;wishful thinking&#x201d; that can often lead to mistaken choices and unwanted consequences. Includes many specific exercises and meditations designed to nourish and support each individual&#x2019;s natural intuitive gifts.</p><p><b>Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the <i>Sunday Times</i> of London as one of the &#x201c;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&#x201d; and by <i>Sunday Mid-Day</i> (India) as one of the ten people&#x2015;along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha&#x2015;who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.</b></p></p><p><b>Osho</b> is one of the most provocative and inspiring spiritual teachers of the twentieth century. Known for his revolutionary contribution to the science of inner transformation, the influence of his teachings continues to grow, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world. He is the author of many books, including <i>Love, Freedom, Aloneness</i>; <i>The Book of Secrets</i>, and <i>Innocence, Knowledge, and Wonder</i>.Intuition <br> MAPS <i>When the body functions spontaneously,</i> <i>that is called instinct.</i> <i>When the soul functions spontaneously,</i> <i>that is called intuition.</i> <i>They are alike and yet</i> <i>far away from each other.</i> <i>Instinct is of the body--the gross;</i> <i>and intuition is of the soul--the subtle.</i> <i>And between the two is the mind, the expert,</i> <i>which never functions spontaneously.</i> <i>Mind means knowledge.</i> <i>Knowledge can never be spontaneous.</i> <i>Instinct is deeper than intellect and</i> <i>intuition is higher than intellect.</i> <i>Both are beyond the intellect, and both are good.</i> HEAD, HEART, AND BEING Your individuality can be divided--just for the purpose of understanding it; otherwise there is no division. It is one single unity, whole: the head, the heart, and the being. Intellect is the functioning of the head, instinct is the functioning of your body, and intuition is the functioning of your heart. And behind these three is your being, whose only quality is witnessing. The head only thinks; hence it never comes to any conclusion. It is verbal, linguistic, logical, but because it has no roots in reality, thousands of years of philosophical thinking have not given us a single conclusion. Philosophy has been the greatest exercise in futility Intellect is very clever in creating questions and then creating answers, and then out of those answers, more questions and more answers. It can make palaces of words, systems of theories, but they are all just hot air. The body cannot rely on your intellect, because the body has to live. That's why all essential functions of the body are in the hands of instinct--for example, breathing, heartbeat, digestion of your food, circulation of the blood. A thousand and one processes are going on inside your body in which you have no part at all. And it is good that nature has given body its own wisdom. Otherwise, if your intellect were to take care of the body, life would have been impossible! Because sometimes you may forget to breathe--at least in the night, how will you breathe while you are asleep? You are already so confused just with thoughts; in this confusion, who will take care about the blood circulation, whether the right amount of oxygen is reaching your cells or not? Whether the food that you are eating is being analyzed into its basic constituents, and those basic constituents are sent where they are needed? And this whole, tremendous amount of work is done by instinct. You are not needed. You can remain in a coma; still the body will continue to work. Nature has given all essential functions of your body to instinct, and it has left all that makes your life meaningful ... because just to exist, just to survive, has no meaning. To give meaning to your life, existence has given intuition to your heart. Out of your intuition arises the possibility of art, of aesthetics, of love, of friendship--all kinds of creativity are intuitive. <i></i> Intellect has its use, but by some misfortune it has become the master of your whole being. That has created immense troubles in the world. But the marketplace does not need your intuition. It does not deal in love, in your sensibilities; it deals with solid and mundane things. For that, your intellect--which is the most superficial part--functions. Intellect is for the mundane life with others in the marketplace, in the world, to make you capable of functioning. It is mathematics, it is geography, it is history, it is chemistry--all science and all technology are created by your intellect. Your logic and your geometry are useful--but the intellect is blind. It simply goes on creating things, but it does not know whether they are being used for destruction or for creation. A nuclear war will be a war created by intellect. Intellect has its use, but by some misfortune it has become the master of your whole being. That has created immense troubles in the world. The master is hidden behind these three: the body, the mind, the heart. The master is hidden behind all these three--that is your being. But you never go inward; all your roads go outward,all your senses go outward. All your achievements are out there in the world. Intellect is useful in the world, and all your educational systems are techniques to avoid the heart and take your energy directly to your head. The heart can create troubles for the head--the heart knows nothing of logic. The heart has a totally different center of functioning, and that is intuition. It knows love, but love is not a commodity of any use in the world. It knows beauty, but what are you going to do with beauty in the marketplace? <i></i> Nobody wants his or her children to become musicians or painters or dancers. Everybody wants them to be doctors, engineers, scientists, because those professions pay. The people of the heart--the painters, the poets, the musicians, the dancers, the actors--are all irrational. They create great beauty, they are great lovers, but they are absolutely unfit in a society that is arranged by the head. Your artists are thought by your society to be almost outcast, a little bit crazy, an insane type of people. Nobody wants his or her children to become musicians or painters or dancers. Everybody wants them to be doctors, engineers, scientists, because those professions pay. Painting, poetry, dance, are dangerous, risky--you may end up just a beggar on the street, playing on your flute. The heart has been denied--and by the way, it will be useful to remember that the denial of the heart has been the denial of the woman. And unless the heart is accepted, the woman cannotbe accepted. Unless the heart has the same opportunity to grow as the head, the woman cannot have liberation. The woman is heart and the man is head. The distinction is clear. Instinct, nature has taken in its own hands. And whenever you interfere with instinct, you create perversions. All the religions have been doing that; every religion has been interfering with the body--and the body is absolutely innocent, it has never done anything wrong. If you accept the body in its absolute naturalness, it will help you tremendously. It will help your heart, nourish your heart. It will help your intelligence to become sharper, because the nourishment for the intellect comes from the body, nourishment to the heart comes from the body. And if your head, your heart, and your body are all in a symphony, then to find your being is the easiest thing in the world. But because they are in conflict, your whole life goes on being wasted in that conflict, conflict between instinct and intellect and intuition. <i></i> I am not against anything. I am only against disharmony, and because your head is creating the most inharmonious situation, I want your head to be put in its right place. It is a servant, not a master. A wise person creates a harmony between the head, the heart, and the body. In this harmony comes the revelation of the source of one's life, the very center, the soul. And that is the greatest ecstasy possible--not only to human beings but in this whole universe, nothing more is possible. I am not against anything. I am only against disharmony, and because your head is creating the most inharmonious situation, I want your head to be put in its right place. It is a servant, not a master. As a servant it is great, helpful. A Dublin milkman has just finished his delivery, so he parks his horse and cart outside the pub and goes in for a drink. Refreshed after an hour, he comes out to find his horse painted bright green. Angry, he strides back into the pub and demands, "Which of you just painted my horse green?" A seven-foot Irish giant stands up and, towering over him, says, "I did. Want to do something about it?" The milkman gives a sickly grin and says, "I just came in to tell you, the first coat is dry!" Intellect is helpful! In some situations you will be in need of intellect--but only as a servant, not as a master. PAST PRESENT, AND FUTURE You have a past and you have a present and you have a future. Instinct is what belongs to your animal past. It is very old, solid; it is the inheritance of millions of years. And when I say it is animal-like, I am not condemning it. With the word <i>animal</i> the priests of all religions have associated some condemnation--but I am simply stating a fact, with no condemnation at all. Our past was an animal past. We have passed through all kinds of animals; our evolutionhas been from fish up to man, passing through all the species of animals. It has been a long, long journey to arrive at mankind. Intellect is human. It is our present. That's how we function, through intellect. All our sciences, all our businesses, all our professions, whatever is going on in the world--our politics, our religion, our philosophy--they are all based on intellect. Intellect is human. Instinct is almost infallible because it is so old, so ripe, so mature. Your eyes are blinking--are you doing it? They go on doing it by themselves--this is instinct. Your heart is beating, your breathing is going in and out; it is not up to your intellect to look after all these essential things of life. They are in the hands of instinct because instinct is absolutely infallible. It never forgets to breathe, it never forgets anything. <i></i> Your heart is beating, your breathing is going in and out--all these essential things of life are in the hands of instinct because instinct is absolutely infallible. It never forgets anything. The intellect is fallible because it is new, a recent arrival. It is just groping in the dark, still trying to find out what it is and where it belongs. And because it does not have roots in experience, it substitutes experience with beliefs, philosophies, ideologies. They become the focus of intellect. But they are all fallible because they are all man-made, manufactured by some clever guy. And they are not applicable in every situation. They may be right in one situation, and in another situation they may not be right. But intellect is blind, it knows not how to deal with the new. It always brings the old answer to the new question. <i></i> Intellect is blind, it knows not how to deal with the new. It always brings the old answer to the new question. Paddy and Sean are sitting opposite the local whorehouse in Dublin, discussing the virtues of the Catholic faith. Suddenly, Gideon Greenberg, the local rabbi, approaches the whorehouse door, looks left and right, then hurries up the stairs. "Did you see that?" roars Paddy. "I'm glad I am a Catholic." Ten minutes later, the Anglican priest approaches the door, looks around quickly, then dashes up the stairs. "Another hypocrite," says Paddy, laughing. "Thank God I am a Catholic." A few minutes later Sean nudges Paddy and says, "Hey, man, look! There is Father O'Murphy coming this way." The two men watch in stunned silence as the Catholic priest disappears up the stairs into the whorehouse. Suddenly Paddy jumps to his feet, crosses himself, and shouts at Sean, "Where is your respect? Stand up and take off your hat! There must be a death in the house!" Intellect lives through prejudices; it is never fair. By its very nature it cannot be, because it has no experience. Instinct is alwaysfair and shows you exactly the natural way, the relaxed way, and the way that the universe follows. But strangely, instinct has been condemned by all religions, and intellect has been praised. Of course, if everybody follows instinct, there is no need of any religion, no need of any God, no need of any priest. Animals don't need God and they are perfectly happy--I don't see that they are missing God. Not a single animal, not a single bird, not a single tree, is missing God. They are all enjoying life in its utter beauty and simplicity with no fear of hell and no greed for heaven, no philosophical differences. There are no Catholic lions, there are no Protestant or Hindu lions. The whole existence must be laughing at man, at what has happened to human beings. If birds can live without religions and churches and mosques and temples, why can't man? The birds never fight religious wars; neither do the animals nor the trees. But you are a Mohammedan and I am a Hindu and we cannot coexist--either you have to become converted to my religion or be ready; I will send you to heaven immediately! If instinct is praised, these religions lose any rationale, any reason to exist, so they praise intellect. And the third thing, which is your future, is intuition. So these three words have to be understood. Instinct is physical--your past, based on the experience of millions of years, infallible, never commits any mistake and does miracles in you of which you are not even aware. How does your food become blood? How does your breathing go on functioning even when you are asleep? How does your body separate the oxygen from nitrogen? How does your instinctive world of nature go on giving to every part of your body what it needs? Howmuch oxygen is needed in your head for the mind to function? The exact amount is sent through blood running all around the body, distributing fresh oxygen, taking out the old, used, dead cells, replacing them with new ones and taking them back to places from where they can be disposed of. The scientists say that what instinct does for man, we are not yet capable of doing. And in a small body the instinct does so many miracles. If someday science wanted to do the work of a single human body, it would need at least one square mile of factory for a single human being. Tremendous machinery! And still it will not be infallible; machinery can break, can stop, the electricity can go off. But for seventy years continuously, or even one hundred years for a few people, the instinct goes on functioning perfectly well. The electricity never goes off. Not a single mistake is committed; everything goes according to plan, and the plan is in every cell of your body. The day we can read the code of the human cells, we will be able to predict everything about a child even before he is born, even before he is in the mother's womb. The cells of the parents have a program, and in that program your age, your health, what kind of diseases you will have, your genius, your intelligence, your talents, your whole destiny is contained. Like instinct, at the other polarity of your being--beyond the mind, which is the world of intellect--is the world of intuition. Intuition opens its doors through meditation. Meditation is simply a knocking on the doors of intuition. Intuition is also completely ready. It does not grow; you have inherited that too from existence. Intuition is your consciousness, your being. Intellect is your mind. Instinct is your body. And just as instinctfunctions perfectly on behalf of the body, intuition functions perfectly as far as your consciousness is concerned. Intellect is just between these two--a passage to be passed, a bridge to be crossed. But there are many people, many millions of people, who never cross the bridge. They simply sit on the bridge thinking they have arrived home. The home is on the farther shore, beyond the bridge. The bridge joins instinct and intuition. But it all depends on you. You may start making a house on the bridge--then you have gone astray. Intellect is not going to be your home. It is a small instrument, to be used only for passing from instinct to intuition. So only the person who uses his intellect to go beyond it can be called intelligent. Intuition is existential. Instinct is natural. Intellect is just groping in the dark. The faster you move beyond intellect, the better; intellect can be a barrier to those who think nothing is beyond it. Intell...</p><h2>Magic Kingdom for Sale--Sold!

Eminent historian Nell Irvin Painter blends a vivid narrative based on the latest research with a wonderful array of artwork by African American artists, works which add a new depth to our understanding of black history. <br><br> Painter offers a history written for a new generation of African Americans, stretching from life in Africa before slavery to today's hip-hop culture. The book describes the staggering number of Africans--over ten million--forcibly transported to the New World, most doomed to brutal servitude in Brazil and the Caribbean. Painter looks at the free black population, numbering close to half a million by 1860 (compared to almost four million slaves), and provides a gripping account of the horrible conditions of slavery itself. The book examines the Civil War, revealing that it only slowly became a war to end slavery, and shows how Reconstruction, after a promising start, was shut down by terrorism by white supremacists. Painter traces how through the long Jim Crow decades, blacks succeeded against enormous odds, creating schools and businesses and laying the foundations of our popular culture. We read about the glorious outburst of artistic creativity of the Harlem Renaissance, the courageous struggles for Civil Rights in the 1960s, the rise and fall of Black Power, the modern hip-hop movement, and two black Secretaries of State. Painter concludes that African Americans today are wealthier and better educated, but the disadvantaged are as vulnerable as ever. <br><br> Painter deeply enriches her narrative with a series of striking works of art--more than 150 in total, most in full color--works that profoundly engage with black history and that add a vital dimension to the story, a new form of witness that testifies to the passion and creativity of the African-American experience. <br><br> * Among the dozens of artists featured are Romare Bearden, Elizabeth Catlett, Beauford Delaney, Jacob Lawrence, and Kara Walker <br><br> * Filled with sharp portraits of important African Americans, from Olaudah Equiano (one of the first African slaves to leave a record of his captivity) and Toussaint L'Ouverture (who led the Haitian revolution), to Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth, to Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X<br></p><p><br><strong>Nell Irvin Painter</strong> is the Edward Professor of American History at Princeton. A former Director of Princeton's Program in African-American Studies, she is the author of <em>Sojourner Truth: A Life, A Symbol</em> and <em>Standing at Armageddon: The United States 1877-1919</em>.<br>This new study by Princeton historian Painter (<i>Standing at Armageddon</i>, etc.) aims not merely to provide an updated scholarly account of African-American history, but to enrich our understanding of it with the subjective views of black artists, which she places alongside the more objective views of academics. The result is a book that contains both a compelling narrative and numerous arresting images, but that does not always successfully tie the two together. To be fair, Painter is a historian, not an art critic. Her primary purpose in including artworks is to illustrate historical points and to show black Americans as creators of their own history. Nevertheless, readers will likely be frustrated by the lack of analysis accompanying the images&#x2014;Painter simply summarizes most of the art works, leaving much of their complexity and ambiguity unexplored. Thus, she inadvertently diminishes their power as complicated pieces of individual expression. Painter is clearly adept at writing straightforward history, however, and on this front the book is lucid, engaging and topical. It does an excellent job revealing both the African and the American dimensions of African-American history. And her work has the additional merit of following the past into the present, tracing the history of black Americans all the way up to the hip-hop era, the controversies surrounding black voters in the 2000 presidential election and the ongoing issues of incarceration and health care. 148 images, 4 maps.<i> (Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Embedded in the collective psyche is the notion that discipline is the cornerstone to achieving these goals. <i>Out of Control</i> offers a never-before-published perspective on why the entire premise of discipline is flawed. Dr. Shefali Tsabary reveals how discipline is a major cause of generations of dysfunction. The author goes to the heart of the problems parents have with children, challenging society&#x2019;s dependence on discipline, daring readers to let go of fear-based ideologies and replace them with an approach that draws parent and child together. The key is ongoing meaningful connection between parent and child, free from threats, deprivation, punishment, and timeouts all forms of manipulation. Parents learn how to enter into deep communion with their children, understanding the reasons for a behavior and how to bring out the best in the child. Far from a laissez-faire, anything goes, approach, this is how a child learns responsibility and takes ownership of their life, equipped with character and resilience that flow naturally from within.<br></p><p><br>Where did the belief come from that we need to discipline our children if they are to grow up into individuals who are well adjusted and who make something of their lives?<br>Out of Control reveals how the very discipline we impose to control behavior is in reality a major cause of bad behavior, disrespect for adults, and dysfunction such as bullying, hostility toward family and society, drugs, alcoholism, and teen suicide.<br>Dr Tsabary asserts that to parent effectively requires us to develop a deep connection with our children, so that we address the feelings that drive a child's behavior instead of punishing. "When we tackle the reason for the behavior," says Dr Tsabary, "it automatically changes."<br>Far from a laissez-faire, "anything goes" approach, Dr Tsabary advocates for a high level of parental resolve that majors not in control, but in helping a child develop a sense of personal responsibility.<br>Authentic connection, in which children can be real with their parents, leads to a home in which self-discipline prevails-- both for the child and the parent.<br>The need to "impose our will" on our children evaporates, leading to respect, ownership of one's life, and a strong character marked by a resilience that flows naturally from within.<br><b>Shefali Tsabary, Ph.D.,</b> received her doctorate in Clinical Psychology from Columbia University, New York.

Yet numerous federal judges--led by the Supreme Court--have used the Constitution as a blank check to substitute their own views on hot-button issues such as abortion, capital punishment, and samesex marriage for perfectly constitutional laws enacted by We the People through our elected representatives.<br> <br> Now, <b><i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&nbsp;to the Constitution</i></b> shows that there is very little relationship between the Constitution as ratified by the thirteen original states more than two centuries ago and the "constitutional law" imposed upon us since then. Instead of the system of state-level decision makers and elected officials the Constitution was intended to create, judges have given us a highly centralized system in which bureaucrats and appointed--not elected--officials make most of the important policies.<br> <br> In<b><i> The Politically Incorrect Guide&nbsp;to the Constitution, </i></b>Professor Kevin Gutzman&nbsp;explains how the Constitution:&nbsp;<br> <ul> <li>Was understood by the founders who wrote it and the people who ratified it.</li> <li>Follows the Supreme Court as it uses the fig leaf of the Constitution to cover its naked usurpation of the rights and powers the Constitution explicitly reserves to the states and to the people.</li> <li>Slid from the Constitution's republican federal government, with its very limited powers, to an unrepublican "judgeocracy" with limitless powers.</li> <li>How&nbsp;the Fourteenth Amendment has been twisted to use the Bill of Rights as a check on state power instead of on federal power, as originally intended.</li> <li>The radical inconsistency between "constitutional law" and the rule of law.</li> <li>Contends that the judges who receive the most attention in history books are celebrated for acting against the Constitution rather than for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul> <br>As Professor Gutzman shows, constitutional law is supposed to apply the Constitution's plain meaning<b><i> to prevent judges, presidents, and congresses from overstepping their authority. </i></b>If we want to return to the founding fathers' vision of the Republic, if we want the Constitution enforced in the way it was explained to the people at the time of its ratification, then we have to overcome the "received wisdom" about what constitutional law is. <b><i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&nbsp;to the Constitution </i></b>is an important step in that direction.<br> <br>&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin R.

He is a pioneer of the new paradigm of science called &#x201c;science within consciousness,&#x201d; an idea he explicates in his seminal book,<i>&nbsp;The Self-Aware Universe</i>, in which he also solves the quantum measurement problem elucidating the famous observer effect. Dr. Goswami has written several popular books based on his research on quantum physics and consciousness, including&nbsp;<i>Physics of the Soul</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Quantum Economics: Unleashing the Power of an Economics of Consciousness</i>.Goswami (Physics/University of Oregon; coauthor, The Cosmic Dancers, 1983) uses quantum physics to promote monistic idealism- -the theory that both matter and mind have their origin in consciousness. The villain here is materialism--the teaching that everything is comprised of atoms--and its tag-along doctrines of locality (that interactions between objects occur in local space-time), strong objectivity (that objects exist independently of consciousness), and epiphenomenalism (that mind is an accidental by-product of brain function). According to Goswami, quantum physics has laid to rest this view of reality: Quantum objects jump from here to there without passing through intervening space, disproving locality; Heisenberg's uncertainty principle disproves strong objectivity, etc. Goswami's explication of modern physics- -which draws on everything from Winnie-the-Pooh to optical illusions--is a model of clarity. Vastly less satisfying is his brief for monistic idealism. For one thing, he writes off an important alternative, dualism--the ``common-sense'' view that mind and matter both exist, that a rock is a rock and a thought is a thought--in a few skimpy paragraphs. For another, his argument is inconsistent: He cites paranormal events as evidence for idealism, but when an exception arises (such as out-of-body experiences, which suggest dualism), he becomes a debunker. Worst of all, when he tries to describe how idealism actually shapes the world, he sounds like Madame Blavatsky with a hangover (``the universe exists as formless potentia in myriad possible branches in the transcendent domain''). Goswami's aim is inviting--who does not wish us to ``realize our full potential--an integrated access to our quantum and classical selves''?--but most readers will remain agnostic. More substantial than Fritjof Capra, which isn't saying much. This is one cosmic egg that may be too big to crack. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Solving problems in groups is exciting, effective, and equitableit helps all students succeed in math. <i>Get It Together</i> is a collection of over 100 mathematics problems for groups of 26 students. The problems cover a wide range of math topics such as logic, functions, algebra, geometry, measurement, and number patterns at various levels of difficulty. Each problem has the same format: six clue cards provide the information needed to solve a problem. Since each member of the group has a different bit of information, everyone works together to arrive at a solution. In one problem, only some people get sick after eating a potluck meal. Was it the swamp chicken, the cheesecake, or something else? The group collaborates to discover which food was the culprit.

The remarkable data the book lays out and the measures it uses are like a spirit level which we can hold up to compare different societies. The differences revealed, even between rich market democracies, are striking. Almost every modern social and environmental problem-ill health, lack of community life, violence, drugs, obesity, mental illness, long working hours, big prison populations-is more likely to occur in a less equal society. The book goes to the heart of the apparent contrast between material success and social failure in many modern national societies.</p><p><i>The Spirit Level </i>does not simply provide a diagnosis of our ills, but provides invaluable instruction in shifting the balance from self-interested consumerism to a friendlier, more collaborative society. It shows a way out of the social and environmental problems which beset us, and opens up a major new approach to improving the real quality of life, not just for the poor but for everyone. It is, in its conclusion, an optimistic book, which should revitalize politics and provide a new way of thinking about how we organize human communities.</p></p><p><p><b>Richard Wilkinson</b> has played a formative role in international research in inequalities in health and his work has been published in 10 languages.

She is the co-founder of The Equality Trust. She studied physical anthropology at Cambridge, nutritional sciences at Cornell and epidemiology at Berkeley before spending four years as an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago.</p>Starred Review. Wilkinson and Pickett make an eloquent case that the income gap between a nation's richest and poorest is the most powerful indicator of a functioning and healthy society. Amid the statistics that support their argument (increasing income disparity sees corresponding spikes in homicide, obesity, drug use, mental illness, anxiety, teenage pregnancies, high school dropouts&#x2014;even incidents of playground bullying), the authors take an empathetic view of our ability to see beyond self-interest. While there are shades of Darwinism in the human hunt for status, there is evidence that the human brain&#x2014;with its distinctively large neocortex&#x2014;evolved the way it has because we were designed to be attentive to, depend on, and be depended on by others. Wilkinson and Pickett do not advocate one way or the other to close the equality gap. Government redistribution of wealth and market forces that create wealth can be equally effective, and the authors provide examples of both. How societies achieve equality, they argue, is less important than achieving it in the first place. Felicitous prose and fascinating findings make this essential reading. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Maker created this team of animal friends to be his envoys for pivotal points of history. This will be their most important mission ever: to be with Jesus throughout his childhood, ministry, passion and resurrection.&nbsp;The story of Christ is told as a story within a story: as George F. Handel writes the greatest music to ever be written in London 1741&#x2014;<i>Messiah.</i>This action-packed adventure opens in 1735 London when famous composer George Friedric Handel is upsettingly passed over by the King of England for the most important musical post in the world. Little does Handel know that God has a far greater assignment - the writing of the most important piece of music of all time: <i>Messiah.</i> In order to fully inspire Handel, the Order of the Seven revisits the life of Christ, working behind the scenes from Jesus&#x2019; childhood to adulthood where he begins his ministry. The team follows Jesus and his twelve disciples through the joy and controversy of Jesus&#x2019; ministry leading up to the painful purpose of his coming: the Passion. The Enemy tried to prevent Messiah&#x2019;s birth &#x2013; now he will stop at nothing to ensure his death through the Pharisees, Herod, Pilate and Judas. But everything becomes clear as to why the Cross is the Divine Plan all along. Follow Jesus&#x2019; disciples and once again visit the Roman family of Antonius, all of whom play a pivotal role in the events of the greatest story ever told.The animal team was with Isaiah when he wrote the words, now they will be with Handel as he writes the music. They must retrieve three items from their time with Jesus to bring back to 1741 London, crucial for Nigel to play his mouse-sized violin in Handel&#x2019;s ear every night to inspire the music of <i>Messiah.</i> The climactic ending takes readers to the London premiere of <i>Messiah </i>where the King of England realizes that the King of Kings reigns supreme, and unbeknownst to him, is present at the premiere of <i>Messiah</i> as well.</p><p><i>"Nowthere are also many other things that Jesus did.

I haveto admit it was a bit overwhelming as I began the process of tackling a book onthe life of THE central figure in all of history: Jesus Christ. I haven'tcovered every single scene of Jesus' ministry. I've hit the highlights, majorscenes and crucial things to know about the road leading to the cross. But whenit comes to the Passion, every word is there. <br>As Michael P. Monaco explained, God spoke to me atone of his concerts in Williamsburg, and the plot line of writing the story ofJesus within the story of Handel writing <i>Messiah</i>fell into my heart and mind. God spoke to me on another pivotal night:Christmas Eve 2011. I was sitting in the Church of the Apostles in Atlanta, GAwhen he said, "You need to get to London and sit in Handel's composing room andwrite." I replied, "Seriously, God?"

So often we allow fear to run our lives. Think about it. Nothing&#x2014;�absolutely nothing&#x2014;�is wrong, but something sets you off, and you start being fearful of something that hasn&#x2019;t happened and likely won&#x2019;t. Seemingly out of the clear blue sky, you start worrying about the bills. You start obsessing about your job. Maybe your boss doesn&#x2019;t really like you. Or maybe your coworker is sabotaging you. Your mind runs with this for a while. Possibly your fear takes the form of worry about your children. Johnny&#x2019;s B minus on a math test might be setting him up for a life of underachievement. Sophie&#x2019;s been dealing with some middle school girl problems, and you worry that her self-�esteem will be permanently damaged. Then, of course, there&#x2019;s always your health. You wake up in the morning with a headache, are sure it&#x2019;s a tumor. Before you know it, you&#x2019;ve become a sick, unemployed, poor parent, all in your mind. Whatever your particular fears are, they serve to constrict you and make your whole field of energy narrow.<br><br>Fear begets fear. Call to mind the image of a garden. What happens if we don&#x2019;t weed a garden? If we don&#x2019;t tend to it, our entire garden&#x2014;�all of those carefully cultivated rosebushes and peonies and daylilies&#x2014;�becomes overgrown. Roots become strangled, cut off from the source. Before you know it, all that beauty vanishes. Fear is an energy. It is an experience. But holding on to fear is unique to our human nature. Consider this: Every living being feels its fear and shakes it off. Cows, deer, fox, even bears&#x2014;�they all feel fear and move on. But we human beings don&#x2019;t. We accumulate fear. We hoard and store it in our bodies. We go out of our way to prove to ourselves that the world is not a safe place. Of course, there is an evolutionary place for fear&#x2014;�after all, it allows us to survive&#x2014;�but we let it run amok. And then it keeps us locked into place. Perhaps we stay in unsatisfying jobs or in bad relationships out of fear that something greater is not on its way. All the time we&#x2019;re doing that, we&#x2019;re invalidating the universal principle of more. The grass continues to grow. Rivers continue to flow into the sea. Galaxies are born. Life seemingly has a way of continuing to evolve into more. Everything in nature validates this principle.<br><br>We need to find our courage, which, of course, is not the absence of fear but rather the willingness to feel the fear and move forward anyway. Fear isn&#x2019;t going to kill us. It&#x2019;s an energy that we can allow to move through us.<br><br>Tend to the garden of your unconscious mind. Imagine yourself in a house surrounded by an absolutely beautiful garden. The only problem is that the garden has been overtaken by fear. Fear&#x2014;�of financial loss, of being alone, of illness, you name it&#x2014;�has taken the form of weeds. Go out of the house and tend to that garden. Visualize yourself on your knees, putting on your gardening gloves, pulling out your fear by its roots. What do we have here? Abandonment? Betrayal? Rejection? Death? It&#x2019;s all about the energy. This is a radical idea, I know&#x2014;but your fears cannot hurt you. Pull out your first weed. The weeds are your vibrational density. Think of them as a mass of tangles. Dirty, all knotted up. What happens next? Here, your story doesn&#x2019;t matter. The specifics of who, what, where, when, and why are beside the point. You&#x2019;re pulling out the energy of fear. Just the energy&#x2014;that&#x2019;s all. When that mass of tangles is uprooted, suddenly there&#x2019;s space. It won&#x2019;t necessarily feel comfortable. But stop for a minute. What does it feel like? Maybe there&#x2019;s a little more room now. Perhaps there&#x2019;s the beginning of new opportunity. In time, we will know. In giving fear our attention, it loses its power over us. The weeds aren&#x2019;t wrong or bad. They&#x2019;re just taking up space.<br><br>Noon<br><br>Perhaps you read the &#x201c;Morning&#x201d; passage while sitting at your kitchen table, grabbing a quick breakfast, a cup of coffee. Or maybe you were already on the train. Or in your car, driving to work as you listened to these words on an audiobook. Wherever you found yourself, I now want you to train your heart and mind&#x2014;your awareness&#x2014;on the energy of fear as it appears throughout your day. Each time today that fear arises within you&#x2014;and make no mistake, it will arise&#x2014;make note of it. Fear is your ground zero.<br><br>Typically, we manage our daily fears in one of three ways:<br><br>We run.<br><br>We stand our ground and fight.<br><br>Or we freeze.<br><br>You might be anticipating the homework assignment that requires you to read two hundred pages by tomorrow. Or the results of a pathology report. Or the business project that requires you to leave your wife and babies and travel halfway around the world to secure a contract. The first day of a new job. A first date. Opening a bill, terrified that you don&#x2019;t have the money to cover it. Life and life situations will call us out on our fear, every single time. And when this happens, the most primitive part of the brain takes over. The part of us that fights, flees, or freezes comes from our base animalistic response to the energy of fear. Everything in the natural world does this in the presence of fear. (Unless of course you&#x2019;re a possum, in which case you play dead.) This happens whether or not there is a legitimate threat. Our muscles contract. Our breathing becomes shallow. Our palms dampen. Our pupils enlarge. Our blood leaves our extremities and pools in the center.<br><br>So what do you do? You learn to allow. You have a familiar place you retreat to as a result of your fear. Get to know the place. Perhaps it&#x2019;s a set behavior, a pattern that you use to compensate for the presence of this uncomfortable energy. Maybe for you it&#x2019;s denial. Or egoic �compensation. Arrogance. Distraction. Withdrawal. Introversion. The fridge. The bar.<br><br>We all have our survival mechanisms. For me, I go to that puffed-�up place: You&#x2019;re not going to mess with me. I once again become that kid in London who had to develop bravado in order to survive. I can be in a business meeting, surrounded by people who know a lot more than I do about the subject at hand, but if I don&#x2019;t like the way things are going, I tend to fall back on false strength. I feel as if I need to be larger than life. This is an old way of adapting, of trying to survive. I have to learn, again and again, to catch myself in that behavior and stop. Trust. Notice. And allow the fear to run through me like a river out to sea.<br><br>So just for today, notice the special place you go when you start to experience fear. Does your ego begin to assert itself? Or do you want to hide? Do you reach for something to distract you? Do you become oblivious and shut down? Or do you try to numb it out? Do you reach for a cigarette, or your phone, or check your email for the five hundredth time? Or perhaps you&#x2019;ll choose not to engage. You&#x2019;ll pull the rug over your head and hope the moment passes.<br><br>Notice. Keep an eye out. It may happen only once today or a hundred times. It doesn&#x2019;t matter. There is immense power in the ability to catch yourself, to observe your own instinctive responses and behavior. And when you do notice, meet yourself with absolute love. The awareness signals the end of the fight. Not to say that your reptilian brain won&#x2019;t snake its way in a new direction. After all, that&#x2019;s what snakes do. But once you train your mind to notice what it&#x2019;s doing, fear will lose its stranglehold.<br><br>Night<br><br>Until now, the invisible force of fear has been your constant companion. It has informed every decision and directed every choice. It is the knot in your heart that keeps you from fully loving. It has appeared at pivotal moments to steer you away from who you know you really are. It is the voice in your head telling you no. It is the very sound of defeat. It steals your birthright from you. It robs you of life itself.<br><br>Fear has served you well.<br><br>It has been your good old friend.<br><br>Until this very moment.<br><br>It&#x2019;s time.<br><br>As with a friend with whom you must part ways, it&#x2019;s time to say thank you. It&#x2019;s time to move on into a greater relationship, a greater receptivity, a greater expression. A greater truth. It&#x2019;s time to embrace the fear&#x2014;old friend&#x2014;and say goodbye. To say, You have been with me for a long time. You have been the voice in my mind, to the point where I know no other. You have protected me and kept me safe. But you have served your purpose, and I must go. I choose to venture beyond your jurisdiction. I have the courage to walk into the unknown.</p><h2>Catholic Morality: A Course in Religion - Book III</h2><p>Suggestions for study. A brief but complete book on traditional Catholic morality. Covers every basic aspect--the purpose of life, free will, the Natural Law, positive divine law, human positive laws, elements of a moral act, virtues, Christian perfections, Evangelical Counsels, nature of sin, kinds of sin, duties toward God, ourselves, our neighbor, the family, state, Church, etc.</p><p>Father John Laux, M.A., was a high school religion teacher who wrote his own Catholic curricular books after spending a large number of years teaching and researching. His works were first published in 1928 and include <i>Catholic Apologetics</i>, <i>Mass and the Sacraments</i>, <i>Introduction to the Bible</i>, <i>Catholic Morality</i> and <i>Church History</i>. He capsulated the Catholic faith extremely well, thanks to his lively prose and succinct way of accurately explaining the details of theology. Though Father Laux originally wrote his books for high school students, they remain very informative for those in college and even adulthood as well. He wrote in a timeless, direct and to-the-point style that continues to present Catholics with in-depth explanations of their faith today.<br></p><h2>Divide</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Jason Hickel is an anthropologist at the London School of Economics and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He is originally from Swaziland and spent a number of years living with migrant workers in South Africa, studying patterns of exploitation and political resistance in the wake of apartheid. Alongside his ethnographic work, he writes about global inequality, post-development and ecological economics, contributing regularly to the Guardian, Al Jazeera and other outlets. He serves on the Labour Party task force on international development, works as Policy Director for /The Rules collective, and sits on the Executive Board of Academics Stand Against Poverty.

He lives in London.&#34;There&#39;s no understanding global inequality without understanding its history. In The Divide, Jason Hickel brilliantly lays it out, layer upon layer, until you are left reeling with the outrage of it all.&#34; -- Kate Raworth, author of Doughnut Economics &#34;In this iconoclastic book, Jason Hickel shakes up the prevailing paradigm of &#34;development&#34; at its root. He not only exposes the fatal flaws in the standard model of development but also shows how the &#34;development aid&#34; given to the poor countries in order to promote that erroneous model is vastly outweighed by the resource transferred to the rich countries through an unfair global economic system. Many of the proposals that Hickel makes for institutional reform and intellectual re-framing may sound &#34;mad&#34;, as he himself acknowledges, but history has taught us that mad ideas have the habit of becoming respectable over time. This book will radically change the way in which you understand the workings of the global economic system and the challenges faced by poor countries trying to advance within it.&#34; -- Ha-Joon Chang, University of Cambridge, author of 23 Things They Don&#39;t Tell You About Capitalism and Economics: The User&#39;s Guide &#34;With passion and panache, Jason Hickel tells a very different story of why poverty exists, what progress is, and who we are. The Divide is myth busting at its best. The West has controlled the rest through colonization, coups, trade and debt. Poor countries are made poor by this; but a dramatic change is coming.&#34; -- Danny Dorling, author of Inequality and the 1% &#34;Jason Hickel tears apart the destructive myths surrounding global inequality. He shows that colonialism has not disappeared, only changed form. Full of explosive information and devastating argument, The Divide is essential reading.&#34; -- Raoul Martinez, author of Creating Freedom &#34;We all like to think of aid and development as benign in a world full of inequality and violence. Jason Hickel rightly challenges this dangerous myth with a book that crackles with facts, indignation and heart. Why hasn&#39;t global poverty and hunger really declined in the last decades? A combination of NGO and government obfuscation, denial and wishful thinking is not helping the world&#39;s most vulnerable but marking them as numbers. Journalists, aid workers and anybody who has ever given aid (i.e. nearly everybody) should read this book to understand why we all have a responsibility to better serve our fellow human beings. Hickel should be applauded.&#34; -- Antony Loewenstein, author of Disaster Capitalism</p><h2>Faith Formation in a Secular Age: Responding to the Church&#39;s Obsession with Youthfulness (Ministry in a Secular Age)</h2><p>The loss or disaffiliation of young adults is a much-discussed topic in churches today. Many faith-formation programs focus on keeping the young, believing the youthful spirit will save the church. But do these programs have more to do with an obsession with youthfulness than with helping young people encounter the living God?<br><br>Questioning the search for new or improved faith-formation programs, leading practical theologian Andrew Root offers an alternative take on the issue of youth drifting away from the church and articulates how faith can be formed in our secular age. He offers a theology of faith constructed from a rich cultural conversation, providing a deeper understanding of the phenomena of the "nones" and "moralistic therapeutic deism." Root helps readers understand why forming faith is so hard in our context and shows that what we have lost is not the ability to keep people connected to our churches but an imagination for how and where God could be present in their lives. He considers what faith is and what steps we can take to move into it, exploring a Pauline concept of faith as encounter with divine action.</p><p><b>How Faith Can Be Formed in Our Secular Age<br><br></b>"This is <i>not</i> a 'youth ministry' book. This is a book that holds up a mirror to the contemporary church to help us see how we've come to reflect the culture around us and how that has changed our approach to faith formation. While this shift has had significant impact on youth, none of us are immune. With his typical combination of careful scholarship, pastoral wisdom, and lively prose, Root not only diagnoses the problem but also constructively charts a way forward. If we care about the future of faith formation, every seminarian should be reading this book."<br>--<b>James&nbsp;K.&nbsp;A. Smith</b>, Calvin College; author of <i>You Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit</i><br><br>"With a little help from Charles Taylor's notion of transcendence, Root offers a corrective to mere 'authenticity' in a kenotic theology that views Christian formation not as affiliation but as union 'in Christ' in ministry. More than any living writer, Root has sparked the theological imagination of a generation of youth ministers. In a field of practice notorious for 'tips, tricks, and techniques,' this book promises not an easy way forward but one that is faithful nonetheless."<br>--<b>David&nbsp;F. White</b>, Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary<br><br>"Root uses the current lament over the loss of the 'nones' to lay bare the ultimately secular understandings of faith that these concerns are grounded on. In exchange, he offers a more biblical, theological, and philosophically coherent vision of faith formation that is grounded in transcendence through participation in Christ. A volume worthy of careful study and consideration for the contemporary American church as a whole."<br>--<b>Dave Scott</b>, School of Intercultural Studies, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"Root's book is the perfect response to anyone looking at Moralistic Therapeutic Deism and wondering how in the world we got here. It is a masterful weaving together of history, the social sciences, and theological disciplines. Simply put, this book epitomizes what it means to be a practical theologian and ultimately leaves the reader knowing and loving God more."<br>--<b>Amanda&nbsp;J.

Hadot takes ancient philosophy out of its customary realm of names, dates, and arid abstractions and plants it squarely in the thick of life. Through a meticulous historical reading, he shows how the various schools, trends, and ideas of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy all tended toward one goal: to provide a means for achieving happiness in this life, by transforming the individual&#x2019;s mode of perceiving and being in the world.</p><p>Most pressing for Hadot is the question of how the ancients conceived of philosophy. He argues in great detail, systematically covering the ideas of the earliest Greek thinkers, Hellenistic philosophy, and late antiquity, that ancient philosophers were concerned not just to develop philosophical theories, but to practice philosophy as a way of life&#x2015;a way of life to be suggested, illuminated, and justified by their philosophical &#x201c;discourse.&#x201d; For the ancients, philosophical theory and the philosophical way of life were inseparably linked.</p><p><i>What Is Ancient Philosophy?</i> also explains why this connection broke down, most conspicuously in the case of academic, professional philosophers, especially under the influence of Christianity. Finally, Hadot turns to the question of whether and how this connection might be reestablished. Even as it brings ancient thoughts and thinkers to life, this invigorating work provides direction for those who wish to improve their lives by means of genuine philosophical thought.</p></p><p><p>Pierre Hadot was Professor Emeritus at the Coll�ge de France.

In this highly personal and insightful odyssey of the heart and mind, she encounters Tibetan Buddhist meditators, Mexican shamans, and Native American elders, among others. In rapt prose, she recounts her explorations from Japanese Zen meditation to hallucinogenic plants, from the Dogon people of Mali to the Mayan rain forest, all the while creating "an adventure of the spirit and a feast of wisdom old and new&#x201d; (Peter Matthiessen). Halifax believes that deep ecology (which attempts to fuse environmental awareness with spiritual values) works in tandem with Buddhism and shamanism to discover the interconnectedness of all life,&#x201d; and to regain life&#x2019;s sacredness. Grove Press is proud to reissue this important work by one of Buddhism&#x2019;s leading contemporary teachers.<br></p><p>Joan Halifax, PhD, is a Zen priest and anthropologist who has served on the faculty of Columbia University, the University of Miami School of Medicine, the New School for Social Research, and Naropa University. For forty years she has worked with dying people and has lectured on the subject of death and dying at Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Medical School, Georgetown Medical School, and many other academic institutions. In 1990, she founded Upaya Zen Center, a Buddhist study and social action center in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1994, she founded the Project on Being with Dying, which has trained hundreds of health-care professionals in the contemplative care of dying people.Radical ecospiritual memoirs and meditations from a globe- trotting seeker of truth. Halifax (Shamanic Voices, 1991, etc.--not reviewed) boasts impressive New Age credentials: ex-wife of psychologist Stansilav Grof; former assistant to Joseph Campbell; creator of California's spiritually experimental Ojai Foundation; student of assorted shamans and of Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh (who offers a grateful introduction). During her decades of world travel--her memories here range from circumambulating a sacred Tibetan mountain to eating peyote in Mexico's Huichol Sierras--Halifax has evolved a worldview that rejects what she calls Western society's ``dualistic'' perspective in favor of one that perceives ``a self coextensive with all phenomena.'' Simply ``by being born,'' Halifax contends, we share ``the World Wound''--a state of universal suffering--that we can escape through several paths, or ``Ways'': the Way of ``Traditions''; of ``the Mountain''; of ``Language''; of ``Story''; of ``Nonduality''; of ``Protectors''; of ``Ancestors,'' and of ``Compassion.'' Each Way involves a return to ``the fruitful darkness''--the shadow side of things, found in the root truths of Native religions, in the fecundity of nature, and in the stillness of meditation. Halifax writes of these paths, and of how she's walked them, in loamy, para-poetic prose: ``Mountain's realization comes through the details of breath. Mountain appears in each step. Mountain then lives inside our bones, inside our heartdrum.'' While declarations such as these, examined in reason's cool light, can seem opaque, even wooly-headed, they gather real force as they roll over pages, ultimately offering a warm and potent testament to the author's beliefs and to a life lived vigorously for the sake of the spirit. Not for those enamored of logic and common sense. But those who wish to ``hear,'' as Halifax puts it, the ``language of the river, rock, and wind,'' will find much to listen to. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Clean. So why did things go so wrong for the determined young bride?</p><p>I flew to the Caribbean on a Wednesday, and Thursday morning gave the blackmailer&#x2019;s bagman a routing number to an account containing $109,000. The bagman gave me a video shot secretly at a party thrown by my goddaughter, Shay Money, for her bridesmaids.</p><p>In the sepulchre chill of a cubicle provided by the Bank of Aruba, I popped the cassette into a minicamera long enough to confirm its contents before nodding at the teller.</p><p>Yes. She could transfer the funds.</p><p>Bagman and teller conversed in patois French as I stowed the cassette in a briefcase, focusing on details to mitigate my nausea. Inside the men&#x2019;s room, I filled a marble sink with water, then lathered face and hands, but the taint was subcutaneous, associative. Soap couldn&#x2019;t cut it. I had helped Shay with high school homework. I&#x2019;d fielded her homesick letters when she was a college freshman.</p><p>After leaving the bank, I pulled my rental around the block, waited, then followed the bagman&#x2019;s Fiat to a waterfront bar. Big round man, big round head. I battled the urge to snatch him from the parking lot, then drive to a secluded place.</p><p>I&#x2019;m no longer authorized to do that sort of thing.</p><p>Eight hours later, I landed at Miami International, then caught a commuter flight to Fort Myers Regional, a forty-minute drive from my home and laboratory on Sanibel Island, southwest coast of Florida.

She was her usual affectionate, alpha-female self, body docked to mine so she could steer me efficiently toward baggage, or her awaiting car. But there was an intensity to the way she hugged close.

You and your bridesmaids were on a patio by a swimming pool, a view of the ocean below. With three men I assume were locals&#x2014;so the party was just getting started. That was enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really.&#x201d;</p><p>Another lie. The video had been queued to footage that was unambiguously graphic.

Not that there&#x2019;s anything really <i>bad</i>. Just stupid. The sort of things we did in college&#x2014;smoke grass, smooch with strangers. But Michael wouldn&#x2019;t have understood. None of our guys would, even though it seemed harmless at the time. We tried to turn the clock back&#x2014;Liz, Corey, Beryl, and me&#x2014;and have one last fling . . . only now, I wish we&#x2019;d never heard of that damn island. By October, we&#x2019;ll all be married. And we&#x2019;ve got professions. We&#x2019;re grown-ups now, not sorority girls.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d just lied to Shay, so why did I find it so irritating that she was lying to me? My own moral code varies with time zones and border crossings, plus I do not accept the premise that human behavior can be separated neatly into columns of right and wrong. So who the hell am I to judge? But I am neither so jaundiced nor na�ve that I don&#x2019;t know the difference between a kiss and a blow job.</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t grown-ups also supposed to accept responsibility for their behavior?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>The woman stopped walking for a moment, her expression indignant, then sped ahead. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care for your tone, buddy boy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then stop treating me like I&#x2019;m stupid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? You didn&#x2019;t pay a hundred thousand dollars to spare your future husband seeing you smoke dope and kiss a stranger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just told you: Michael&#x2019;s the jealous type. Like most guys, there&#x2019;s a double standard. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it was innocent fun. He wouldn&#x2019;t have understood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I flew halfway to the equator and back because of innocent fun? Knock it off, Shay. I know better.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it! You said you didn&#x2019;t watch the video!&#x201d;</p><p>The woman slowed enough for me to catch up, eyes searching. The footage I&#x2019;d seen was disturbing.

Because there&#x2019;s a chance we&#x2019;re going to hear from him again.&#x201d;</p><p>Shay stopped and faced me. She took a shuddering breath, and in a voice I hadn&#x2019;t heard since she was a teen, she whispered, &#x201c;Oh . . . Ford, I hope . . . I so hope you&#x2019;re wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>I swept the girl into my free arm and held her, thumping my hand on her back. &#x201c;Me, too, Shay. But if it happens, no surprises, okay? Because it&#x2019;s started.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? <i>What&#x2019;s</i> started? I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;</p><p>I meant the lie we&#x2019;d created. It now had a life of its own.

From neurofeedback with functional magnetic resonance imaging equipment, to the use of radio waves, to biofeedback of the heart and breath, and coverage of biofeedback by health insurance plans, the numerous advances have driven the need for a revised edition to this groundbreaking book that traces the fascinating, untold story of the development of biofeedback.<br><br>Discovered by a small corps of research scientists, this alternative treatment allows a patient to see real-time measurements of their bodily processes. Its advocates claim biofeedback can treat epilepsy, autism, attention deficit disorder, addictions, and depression with no drugs or side effects; bring patients out of vegetative states, even improve golf scores or an opera singer&#x2019;s voice. But biofeedback has faced battles for acceptance in the conservative medical world despite positive signs that it could revolutionize the way an incredibly diverse range of medical and psychological problems are treated. Offering a wealth of powerful case studies, accessible scientific explanations, and dramatic personal accounts, Robbins remarkable history develops our understanding of this important field.<br></p><p>Can you fix your own neurologic problems without resorting to drugs? Science writer Jim Robbins suggests that some such conditions--like epilepsy, autism, and depression--could yield to a recently developed technique called neurofeedback. His book <i>A Symphony in the Brain</i> describes the process, its evolution from the 1970s fad of biofeedback, its practitioners, and some of its success stories. Using computers to quickly provide information on real-time EEG, practitioners train patients to control global or local brain states--or so the theory goes. Unfortunately for its proponents, there are still no rigorous research data showing conclusive results. Robbins makes a good case that the lack of research is due more to scientific turf battles and a drug-dependent medical establishment than to any fault of neurofeedback. Some of the case studies he explores, of children and adults brought out of comas or trained to reduce their epileptic seizure frequency, suggest that we ought to look more deeply and rigorously into the technique. Whether it works can only be determined by controlled studies, which may be forthcoming. In the meantime, Robbins provides contact lists and additional research information for interested readers, as well as the inspiration to pursue a potentially life-saving treatment. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>For over thirty years, Victor Bevine has worked as an actor, screenwriter, audio book narrator, director, and more.

The treatment of the first speech by the crazy antagonist, Peter Stillman--in which the word balloons trail from random objects such as a broken television and a bottle of ink--is brilliant. <i>Neon Lit: Paul Auster's City of Glass</i> deftly illustrates why comics is a perfect format for exploring fictions about text: the words become visible objects of the story.<p><b>Paul Auster </b>is the author of eleven novels, most recently <i>Oracle Night</i>.

D. Vance&#x2019;s <i>Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis</i> has defined Appalachia for much of the nation. What about<i> Hillbilly Elegy</i> accounts for this explosion of interest during this period of political turmoil? Why have its ideas raised so much controversy? And how can debates about the book catalyze new, more inclusive political agendas for the region&#x2019;s future?</p><p><i>Appalachian Reckoning</i> is a retort, at turns rigorous, critical, angry, and hopeful, to the long shadow <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i> has cast over the region and its imagining. But it also moves beyond<i> Hillbilly Elegy</i> to allow Appalachians from varied backgrounds to tell their own diverse and complex stories through an imaginative blend of scholarship, prose, poetry, and photography. The essays and creative work collected in <i>Appalachian Reckoning</i> provide a deeply personal portrait of a place that is at once culturally rich and economically distressed, unique and typically American. Complicating simplistic visions that associate the region almost exclusively with death and decay, <i>Appalachian Reckoning</i> makes clear Appalachia&#x2019;s intellectual vitality, spiritual richness, and progressive possibilities.</p></p><p><p>Anthony Harkins is a professor of history at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where he teaches courses in popular culture and twentieth-century United States history and American studies.

They profoundly engage with the class, racial, and political reasons behind a Silicon Valley millionaire&#x2019;s sudden triumph as the most popular spokesman for what one contributor cleverly calls &#x2018;Trumpalachia.&#x2019; This book is a powerful corrective to the imperfect stories told of the white working class, rural life, mountain folk, and the elusive American Dream.&#x201d;<br> Nancy Isenberg, author of&nbsp;<i>White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America</i><br><br> &nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;So often the song of this place has been reduced to a single off-key voice out of tune and out of touch.&nbsp;<i>Appalachian Reckoning</i>&nbsp;is the sound of the choir, pitch perfect in its capturing of these mountains and their&nbsp;people.

With its detailed text as well as over 250 photographs and measured drawings for over 80 classic pieces, it offers woodworkers and furniture enthusiasts a practical guide to the essentials of replicating a broad range of designs long admired for their sturdy practicality and their spare, elegant beauty.<br>The book first chronicles and describes the Shaker movement and the Shaker way of living, worshiping, and working. It then explores the Shaker approach to furniture design (from chests and chairs to boxes and baskets), construction (including all joinery techniques), and finishing (including recipes for finishes).<br>Three important sections of the book depict dozens of classic Shaker designs, complete with measured drawings. The designs include Shaker "smallcraft" such as a cutting board, scoop, candle sconce, peg-leg footstool and towel rack; more substantial "utility designs" such as a dough bin, cradle, dry sink, butcher block, and bonnet box; and furniture classics such as a Harvard trestle table, maple chair, lap desk, sewing chest, rocking chair, bed, settee and chest of drawers &#x2014; each in its own distinctive way defining the simple, practical grace of Shaker design.</p><b></b><p><b></b></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Next Steps In Weaving: What You Never Knew You Needed to Know</h2><p>There is a lot to learn about weaving!

His passionate lectures on anatomy and art history formed the foundation for <i>The Burne Hogarth</i>�<i> Dynamic Drawing Series</i> that continues to teach and influence artists and animators worldwide.<br><br> Hogarth&#x2019;s art has been exhibited in many important galleries around the world including the Louvre in the Muse� des Arts D�coratifs and Marseilles&#x2019; Biblioth�que.

His new model for "companioning" the bereaved gives a viable alternative to the limitations of the medical establishment, encouraging counselors and other caregivers to aspire to a more compassionate philosophy. This approach argues that grief need no longer be defined, diagnosed, and treated as an illness but rather should be an acknowledgement of an event that forever changes a person's worldview. Through careful listening and observation, the caregiver learns to support mourners and help them help themselves heal.<br></p><p><b>Alan D.

It wouldn't be complicated; we didn't live together, hadn't had a child, and were even able to see ourselves remaining friends, and yet, it was sad. It was Christmas 2004. Here we were in our bungalow at the Hotel Eva Lanka, and we couldn't help remembering a different night, just after we'd met, a night we'd spent marveling that we had found each other and would never part, and would grow old together, happy for the rest of our lives. We even talked about having a child, a little girl. We did have that little girl in the end, and we still trust that we'll live out our days together. We like to think we always knew that everything would work out. But after the dazzling confidence of love at first sight came a complex, chaotic year, and what had at first seemed so certain to us (and still seems so now) no longer appeared at all certain or even desirable on that Christmas in 2004. On the contrary, we were convinced that this vacation would be our last together and that, for all our good intentions, the trip had been a mistake. Lying side by side, we couldn't bring ourselves to mention that first night and the promising future we had longed for so fervently yet seemed somehow to have lost. We were simply watching ourselves draw apart, without hostility, but with regret. It was too bad. For the umpteenth time I spoke of my inability to love, all the more remarkable in that H�l�ne is truly worthy of love. While I was telling myself that I would have to grow old alone, H�l�ne had something else to worry about: just before our departure, her sister Juliette had been hospitalized with a pulmonary embolism, and H�l�ne was afraid Juliette might be seriously ill or even dying. Although I insisted such fears were irrational, H�l�ne could not shake them off, and I resented how she had let herself become absorbed in something that excluded me. She went out on the terrace to smoke a cigarette. I waited for her, lying on the bed and thinking, If she comes back soon, if we make love, then perhaps we won't separate, perhaps we will grow old together after all. But she did not come back. She remained alone on the terrace watching the sky gradually grow lighter, listening to the birds begin to sing, and I fell asleep on my side of the bed, sad, lonely, convinced that my life could only get worse and worse.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>H�l�ne and her son, I and mine: all four of us had signed up for a scuba lesson at the dive club in the neighboring village. Since the last session, however, my Jean-Baptiste had developed an earache and didn't want to go anymore. Tired from our almost sleepless night, H�l�ne and I decided to cancel the lesson. Rodrigue, the only one who'd really wanted to go diving, was disappointed. You can always go swimming in the pool, H�l�ne told him. Well, he'd had it up to here with swimming in the pool. He would have at least liked for someone to accompany him down to the beach below the hotel, where he wasn't allowed to go alone because of the dangerous currents, but no one wanted to go with him, neither his mother nor I, nor Jean-Baptiste, who preferred to read in the boys' bungalow. Jean-Baptiste was thirteen at the time. I had more or less forced this exotic vacation on him, a holiday with a woman he hardly knew and a boy much younger than he was, and he'd been bored from the moment we arrived, which he made clear to us by staying off on his own. Whenever I asked him irritably whether he wasn't happy to be here in Sri Lanka, he replied grudgingly that yes, yes, he was happy, but it was too hot and actually he was happiest in the bungalow, reading or playing his Game Boy. In short, he was a typical adolescent, while I was a typical father of an adolescent, catching myself telling him the same exasperating things my own parents had said to me when I was his age: You ought to go out, look around&nbsp;... What's the point of bringing you all this way?... Like talking to a wall. So Jean-Baptiste retreated into his lair while Rodrigue, left on his own, began bothering H�l�ne, who was trying to nap on a deck chair by the huge saltwater pool, where an elderly but incredibly athletic German woman who resembled Leni Riefenstahl swam every morning for two hours. As for me, still feeling sorry for myself over my inability to love, I went to hang out with the Ayurvedics, as we called the group of Swiss German guests who were staying in some nearby bungalows. They had come to the resort to follow a program of yoga and traditional Indian massage. They weren't meeting in plenary session with their master, so I performed a few asanas with them. Then I wandered back to the pool, where the last breakfast dishes had been cleared and tables were being set for lunch. Soon the tedious question would arise: What should we do that afternoon? In the three days since our arrival we had already visited the forest temple, fed the little monkeys, and seen the reclining Buddhas. So unless we undertook more ambitious cultural excursions, which none of us found tempting, we had exhausted the attractions in our immediate vicinity. Some tourists can spend days in a fishing village rhapsodizing over everything the locals do&#x2014;going to market, mending nets, social rituals of all kinds&#x2014;and I reproached myself for not being like that, for not having passed on to my sons the generous curiosity, the acuity of observation I admire in people like Nicolas Bouvier, the Swiss traveler and writer. I'd brought along <i>The Scorpion-Fish</i>, Bouvier's account of a year he spent in Galle, a large fortified town about thirty kilometers to the east of us along the southern coast of the island. Unlike his most famous book, <i>The Way of the World</i>, a tale of celebration and wonder, <i>The Scorpion-Fish</i> describes collapse, loss, and a descent into the abyss. It presents Sri Lanka as a form of enchantment, but in the perilous sense of the word, not some guidebook come-on for newlyweds and hip backpackers. Bouvier almost lost his mind there, and our visit, whether considered as a honeymoon or a rite of passage for a future blended family, was a failure. And a feeble failure at that, with no bang, only a whimper. I was growing anxious to go home. Crossing the trellised lobby invaded by bougainvilleas, I ran into a frustrated hotel guest who couldn't send a fax because the power was out. At the reception desk he'd heard there'd been an accident, some problem in the village, but he hadn't understood exactly what was wrong and just hoped the power would come back on soon, because his fax was very important. I rejoined H�l�ne, who was awake now and told me something strange was happening.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>The next scene: a small gathering of guests and staff on a terrace at the end of the hotel grounds, looking out over the ocean. Curiously enough, nothing seems amiss at first. Everything appears normal. Then you start to notice how strange things really are. The water seems so far away&nbsp;... Normally, there are about twenty yards of beach between the ocean's edge and the foot of the cliff. Now, however, the sand stretches off into the distance: flat, gray, glistening in the hazy sunshine, like Mont-Saint-Michel at low tide. Then you realize that the sand is littered with objects, but you can't tell what size they are. That piece of twisted wood, is it a broken branch or a whole tree? A really big tree? That crumpled boat, perhaps that's something a bit bigger, maybe an honest-to-god trawler, shattered and tossed aside like a nutshell? There is no sound; no breath of air rustles the fronds of the coconut palms. I don't remember the first words spoken in the group we'd joined, but at one point someone murmured in English, <i>Two hundred children died in the village school</i>.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Built on the cliff overlooking the ocean, the hotel seems swathed in the exuberant vegetation of its grounds. To reach the coastal road, guests go through a guarded gate and down a concrete ramp, at the foot of which some tuk-tuks are usually waiting. Tuk-tuks are auto rickshaws, canvas-roofed motorbikes that seat two passengers, three if they squeeze together, on short trips of up to ten kilometers; for anything more, a taxi is best. There are no tuk-tuks today. H�l�ne and I have come down to the road to find out what's going on. Whatever it is seems serious, but except for the man who mentioned the two hundred dead children (and was immediately contradicted by someone claiming the children couldn't have been in school because it was Poya, the Buddhist celebration of the full moon), no one at the hotel knows anything more than we do. No tuk-tuks; no passersby, either. Ordinarily there's a constant stream: women walking in twos or threes with their packages, schoolchildren in impeccably ironed white shirts, everyone smiling and eager to chat. Aside from the lack of people, nothing seems different about the road, as long as we walk beside the hill shielding us from the ocean. The moment we pass the hill and reach the plain, we discover that to one side everything is normal&#x2014;trees, flowers, low walls, small shops&#x2014;while on the other it's sheer devastation, a mire of blackish mud like a lava flow. After walking a few more minutes toward the village, we see a tall blond man in a torn shirt and shorts coming toward us, haggard, covered in mud and blood. He is Dutch: strangely, that is the first thing he tells us. The second thing is that his wife has been injured. Some villagers have taken her in and he's seeking help, which he hopes to find at our hotel. There was an immense wave, he says, that poured in and then receded, washing away people and houses. He appears to be in shock, more stupefied than relieved at still being alive. H�l�ne offers to go with him to the hotel, where the phone may be working again, and perhaps there'll be a doctor among the guests...</p></p><h2>Strange Practice (A Dr. Greta Helsing Novel)</h2><p><b>In this delightfully witty fantasy adventure, Dr. Greta Helsing, doctor to the undead, must defend London from both supernatural ailments and a bloodthirsty cult.</b><br><br> Greta Helsing inherited her family's highly specialized and highly peculiar medical practice.

Mesopotamia, Syria, and Anatolia were home to an extraordinarily rich and successful culture. Indeed, it was a time and place of earth-shaking changes for humankind: the beginnings of writing and law, kingship and bureaucracy, diplomacy and state-sponsored warfare, mathematics and literature.<br><br>This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> offers a fascinating account of this momentous time in human history. The three thousand years covered here--from around 3500 BCE, with the founding of the first Mesopotamian cities, to the conquest of the Near East by the Persian king Cyrus the Great in 539 BCE-represent a period of incredible innovation, from the invention of the wheel and the plow, to early achievements in astronomy, law, and diplomacy. As historian Amanda Podany explores this era, she overturns the popular image of the ancient world as a primitive, violent place. We discover that women had many rights and freedoms: they could own property, run businesses, and represent themselves in court. Diplomats traveled between the capital cities of major powers ensuring peace and friendship between the kings. Scribes and scholars studied the stars and could predict eclipses and the movements of the planets.<br><br>Every chapter introduces the reader to a particular moment in ancient Near Eastern history, illuminating such aspects as trade, religion, diplomacy, law, warfare, kingship, and agriculture. Each discussion focuses on evidence provided in two or three cuneiform texts from that time. These documents, the cities in which they were found, the people and gods named in them, the events they recount or reflect, all provide vivid testimony of the era in which they were written. <br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's<em> Very Short Introductions</em> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field. Every <em>Very Short Introduction</em> gives a readable evolution of the subject in question, demonstrating how the subject has developed and how it has influenced society. Eventually, the series will encompass every major academic discipline, offering all students an accessible and abundant reference library. Whatever the area of study that one deems important or appealing, whatever the topic that fascinates the general reader, the<em> Very Short Introductions</em> series has a handy and affordable guide that will likely prove indispensable.<br></p><p><br>Amanda H.

This memoir was his brutal and deeply personal account of the Russian Front's appalling carnage. Depicting a running tank engagement lasting for three days, Faust describes how his Tiger unit fought pitched battles in the snows of western Russia against the full might of the Red Army: the T34s, Stalin tanks, Sturmovik bombers and the feared Katyusha rocket brigades. His astonishing testimony reveals the merciless decisions that panzer crews made in action, the devastating power of their weaponry, and the many ways that men met their deaths in the snow and ice of the Ostfront. First published in the late 1940s as &#x2018;Panzerdammerung&#x2019; (&#x2018;Panzer Twilight&#x2019;), this memoir's savage realism shocked the post-war German public. Some readers were outraged at the book's final scenes, while others wrote that, &#x2018;Now, at last, I know what our men did in the East.&#x2019; Today it stands as one of the great semi-autobiographical accounts of warfare in World War 2: a crescendo of horror, grim survival and a fatalistic acceptance of the panzer man&#x2019;s destiny. The only other surviving memoir by this author is 'The Last Panther' - an astonishing account of panzer warfare in the final hours of the Third Reich - also available on Amazon.</p><p>The rarely-heard voice of a World War 2 panzer crewman, now in a modern English translation.</p><h2>Kaffe Fassett&#39;s Quilt Romance: 20 Designs from Rowan for Patchwork and Quilting (Patchwork and Quilting)</h2><p><p>Discover 20 glorious new quilts that will take you on a journey back in time when you flip through <em><strong>Kaffe</strong> <strong>Fassett's Quilt Romance</strong></em>.</p> <p>All the romance of a time gone by is captured in exquisite pastels, set against the dramatic Italianate architecture of a tiny Welsh village -- enchanting patterns that will warm up your home and make wonderful gifts.</p> <p>Based on Fassett's signature line of Rowan fabrics, here's the 11th book in his series of best-selling quilt patterns.</p> <p>You'll find pieces designed by the world's finest quilters, including Liza Prior-Lucy, Pauline Smith, Robert Horton -- and introducing Kim McClean, an Australian quilt designer and teacher.</p> <p>Each pattern includes step-by-step instructions for creating a museum-quality piece -- plus inside tips and techniques that Fassett has picked up in over 30 years as a textile artist.</p> <p>And the stunning color photos by Debbie Patterson will inspire you to get going on your first project when you see the artful beauty in each and every piece.</p></p><p><p>&nbsp;Kaffe Fassett is a name every quilter knows.

Christopher was sent to federal prison for years under a sealed warrant and indictment. <i>The Inheritance</i>, Christopher's personal narrative, shares insider information from his encounters with the Russian Government, President Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, the Clinton White House, the U.S. Justice Department, the Secret Service, and the Kennedy family themselves. It reveals the true intentions of Evelyn Lincoln and her secret promise to Robert Kennedy&#x2014;and Christopher's secret promise to John F. Kennedy Jr. <i>The Inheritance</i> explodes with history-changing information and answers the questions Americans are still asking, while pulling them through a gauntlet of some of the worst prisons this country has to offer.

He survives and begins talking about being able to look down and see the doctor operating and his dad praying in the waiting room. Colton said he met his miscarried sister&#x201a; whom no one had told him about&#x201a; and his great grandfather who died 30 years before Colton was born&#x201a; then shared impossible-to-know details about each.

That's the question that has marine behavioral biologist Nate Quinn and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing very big, wet, gray marine mammals. Until the extraordinary day when a whale lifts its tail into the air to display a cryptic message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite me.</p> <p>Trouble is, Nate's beginning to wonder if he hasn't spent just a little too much time in the sun. 'Cause no one else on his team saw a thing - not his longtime partner, Clay Demodocus; not their saucy young research assistant; not even the spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman Kona (n� Preston Applebaum). But later, when a roll of film returns from the lab missing the crucial tail shot - and his research facility is trashed - Nate realizes something very fishy indeed is going on.</p> <p>By turns witty, irreverent, fascinating, puzzling, and surprising, <i>Fluke</i> is Christopher Moore at his outrageous best.</p></p><p>In his entertaining adventure-in-whale-researching, <i>Fluke, or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings</i>, Nathan Quinn, a prominent marine biologist, has been conducting studies in Hawaii for years trying to unravel the secret of why humpback whales sing. During a typical day of data gathering, Nate believes his mind is failing: the subject whale has "Bite Me" scrawled across its tail. Events become even stranger as the self-proclaimed "action nerds," Nate, photographer Clay, their research assistant Amy, and Kona, a white Rasta (a Jewish kid from New Jersey), encounter sabotage to their data and equipment. They also observe increasingly bizarre whale behavior, including a phone call from the whale to their wealthy sponsor to ask that Nate bring it a hot pastrami and Swiss on rye, and discover both a thriving underwater city and the secret to what happened to Amelia Earhart. <p> Thoughtful, irreverent, and often hilarious, Moore has crafted a tale that contains a bit of the saga of declining whale populations due to hunting and habitat destruction, as well as his over-the-top, decadent wit as applied to scientific methodology and professional jealousies. Moore notes a pasty, rival scientist "looked like Death out for his after-dinner stroll before a busy night of e-mailing heart attacks and tumors to a few million lucky winners," and that killer whales (which are all named Kevin), are "just four tons of doofus dressed up like a police car."

The first translation of the books of the Hebrew Bible (plus additions) into the common language of the ancient Mediterranean world made the Jewish scriptures accessible to many outside Judaism.

For centuries, scholars have looked to the Septuagint for information about the nature of the text and of how passages and specific words were understood.<br><br>For students of the Bible, the New Testament in particular, the study of the Septuagint's influence is a vital part of the history of interpretation.

Jesus called the Eucharist by the name Christians subsequently gave to the latter books of the Holy Bible. It was the "New Covenant," the "New Testament," in his blood. Christians later extended the phrase to cover the books produced by the apostles and their companions; but they did so because these were the books that could be read at Mass.<br>&nbsp;<br>This simple and demonstrable historical fact has enormous implications for the way we read the Bible. In&nbsp;<i>Consuming the Word: The New Testament and the Eucharist</i>&nbsp;in the Early Church, Dr. Scott Hahn undertakes an examination of some of Christianity's most basic terms to discover what they meant to the sacred authors, the apostolic preachers, and their first hearers. Moreover, at a time when the Church is embarking on a New Evangelization he draws lessons for Christians today to help solidify their understanding of the why it is Catholics do what Catholics do.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anyone acquainted with the rich body of writing that flows so inspiringly from the hand and heart of Dr. Hahn knows that he brings profound personal insight to his demonstrated theological expertise,&#x201d; writes Cardinal Donald Wuerl in the foreword to the book.&nbsp; <i>Consuming the Word</i> continues in that illustrious tradition.&nbsp; It brings us a powerful and welcome guide as we take our place in the great and challenging work in sharing the Good News.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Scott Hahn</b></p> <p><strong>Q. In the book you talk about the importance of reading Scripture as the human writers of the Bible intended for it to be read. Any tips on how to do this?</strong></p> <p>A. We should receive the Bible the way it was meant to be received. The books of the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, were written not to be read on a page, but to be proclaimed in the assembly. Through most of history perhaps, most of God&#x2019;s people could not read. Many were illiterate; some were blind; some had other handicaps. Very few could afford to buy books. But all could encounter Christ as he intended, because the Church proclaimed the inspired Word whenever the Holy Mass was celebrated..</p> <p>The Mass presents the whole of the biblical story over the course of a three-year cycle of lectionary readings. Just by showing up on Sunday, Catholics will encounter readings from most of the books of the Bible. If you go to daily Mass, you&#x2019;ll hear most of the Bible proclaimed many times through your life. You&#x2019;ll also have it illuminated by preaching and by the other prayers of the Mass.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s good to take up serious Bible study in addition to our liturgical encounter with the Lord. And for that we have many advantages over our ancestors in the faith. Not only can most of us read, we can even own a copy of the entire Bible. For the first millennium of Christianity, only the very rich could own the Scriptures. If we&#x2019;re feeling a holy ambition, we can take online classes to learn the fine points of Greek and Hebrew, and we can read the Scriptures in their original languages. The early Christians could only dream of such opportunities. We have them &#x2014; but few people take advantage as they should. It&#x2019;s good to be serious about Bible study. But still: the Mass is where it rightly begins. The Church is the &#x201c;pillar and bulwark of truth&#x201d; (1 Timothy 3:15), and the Mass is the way the Church has always shared out the truth.</p> <p><strong>Q. You write that the Bible and the liturgy were made for each other and that consuming the Word of God makes us hunger for the words of God. What do you mean by this?</strong></p> <p>A. Read the documents, visit the churches, and look at the art of earliest Christianity. Everywhere you&#x2019;ll see expressions of a people deeply Eucharistic and deeply biblical. I&#x2019;ll say it again: They did not have the ability to study the Scriptures as you and I do; but they hungered for the Word, and they received the Word. Take a tour of the Roman catacombs, and what do you see? You see the familiar Bible stories: Noah, Jonah, Daniel in the Lion&#x2019;s den, Moses striking the rock. What else do you see? Everywhere you see images of people gathered together at an altar for the breaking of the bread. What did the Church look like in third-century Rome? Just like the Church in Acts 2:42. It was a Church consuming the Word &#x2014; whether in Jerusalem or Rome, Antioch or Egypt, it always looked the same. True love seeks union. The Word-made-flesh is God&#x2019;s love seeking us out. That&#x2019;s the message of the New Testament. God is seeking communion with us &#x2014; and his means are not merely verbal, not simply spiritual. The Word was made flesh so that they could be Eucharistic.</p> <p><strong>Q. Why is reading Scripture through the lens of the early Church necessary for evangelizing in a modern world?</strong></p> <p>A. We are a rootless people, transient as never before, mobile in our work and only intermittently in touch with our families. And yet we have the same old desire our ancestors had: to know where we came from and where we&#x2019;re going, who made us and why. Many religions propose answers to those questions. Christianity and Judaism differ from other religions because their answers take a verifiable historical form. They&#x2019;re not mythological. They&#x2019;re the true story of God&#x2019;s dealings with a particular people living in a specific land at an identifiable time. The Scriptures have all the grittiness of real-world life. Philosophers constantly tell us that one of the qualities that sets modern people apart from their ancestors is &#x201c;historical consciousness.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a debatable point. But if it&#x2019;s true, then Christian history lends our testimony a palpable authenticity. It scratches a modern itch. It feeds a real perennial hunger.</p> <p><strong>Q. How does your book tie-in with the message and goals of the New Evangelization?</strong></p> <p>A. Pope John Paul II asked Catholics to &#x201c;base the New Evangelization on the Eucharist.&#x201d; There is only one Christ, and we proclaim him as the Eucharistic Lord. This was the proclamation of the early Church. For several generations there was no book that could be called the &#x201c;New Testament.&#x201d; That phrase was used to describe the Mass.</p> <p>Listen, evangelization is always an impossible task. Do you think the Apostles really stood a chance as they set out to convert the Greco-Roman world? All the might of Rome was arrayed against their project. They had to overcome the weight of pagan tradition, and the long-established habits of a cruel and pornographic culture.</p> <p>Yet they converted the world. How was that possible? They did it with the power of the New Testament, which is the grace of the Mass &#x2014; which is the grace of salvation! The Mass reminds us that evangelization is a gift before it&#x2019;s a task. It&#x2019;s receiving before it&#x2019;s doing. And we can&#x2019;t share what we don&#x2019;t first possess.</p><p><b>DR. SCOTT W. HAHN</b> holds the Fr.

How can we meet and know God with ongoing joy rather than experiencing the Christian life as a series of guilt-inducing disappointments?<br><br>Phillip Cary explains that knowing God is a gradual, long-term process that comes through the Bible experienced in Christian community, not a to-do list designed to help us live the Christian life "right." This clearly written book covers ten things Christians <i>don't</i> have to do to be close to God, such as hear God's voice in their hearts, find God's will for their lives, and believe their intuitions are the Holy Spirit. Cary skillfully unpacks the riches of traditional Christian spirituality, bringing the real good news to Christians of all ages.</p><p><b>10 Things You Don't Have to Do to Be Close to God<br></b><br>Like a succession of failed diet regimens, the much-touted techniques that are supposed to bring us closer to God "in our hearts" can instead make us feel anxious, frustrated, and overwhelmed.

Phil Cary is worried too: worried that evangelicals are suffering needlessly because they have imbibed a consumerist spirituality that offers much but provides little. Phil's prescription for spiritual indigestion? A turning away from the self to the one who continually speaks a healing, saving word to us, Christ himself.

With <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>, Hansberry gave this country its most movingly authentic portrayal of black family life in the inner city. Barely five years later, with <i>The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window</i>, Hansberry gave us an unforgettable portrait of a man struggling with his individual fate in an age of racial and social injustice. These two plays remain milestones in the American theater, remarkable not only for their historical value but for their continued ability to engage the imagination and the heart.<br><br>With an Introduction by Robert Nemiroff</p><p>"Rich and warm and funny and varied ... beautifully written."-- Los Angeles Times, on The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window<p>"One of a handful of great American plays -- it belongs in the inner circle, along with Death of a Salesman, Long Day's Journey Into Night and The Glass Menagerie."--Washington Post, on A Raisin in the Sun</p><b>Lorraine Hansberry</b>, at twenty-nine, became the youngest American, the fifth woman, and the first black playwright to win the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for the Best Play of the Year.

The Qabalah, or "received teachings," is the outcome of experiences of those who have climbed the ladder of the Tree by arranging their lives according to its pattern of perfection. The Tree provides the means of receiving inner world contacts with types of consciuosness normally inaccessible to the ordinary human mind--it is from and through these sources that the "teaching" comes. Here William Gray has presented a step by step guide to the Tree of Life and the Four Worlds of the Qabalahs--the worlds of contemplation, meditation, magic and daily action. The Tree of Life is a means and not an end.

Written by the English philosopher Gillian Rose as she was dying of cancer, it is a book about both the fallibility and the endurance of love, love that becomes real and lasting through an ongoing reckoning with its own limitations. Rose looks back on her childhood, the complications of her parents&#x2019; divorce and her dyslexia, and her deep and divided feelings about what it means to be Jewish. She tells the stories of several friends also laboring under the sentence of death. From the sometimes conflicting vantage points of her own and her friends&#x2019; tales, she seeks to work out (seeks, because the work can never be complete&#x2014;to be alive means to be incomplete) a distinctive outlook on life, one that will do justice to our yearning both for autonomy and for connection to others. With droll self-knowledge (&#x201c;I am highly qualified in unhappy love affairs,&#x201d; Rose writes, &#x201c;My earliest unhappy love affair was with Roy Rogers&#x201d;) and with unsettling wisdom (&#x201c;To live, to love, is to be failed&#x201d;), Rose has written a beautiful, tender, tough, and intricately wrought survival kit packed with necessary but unanswerable questions.</p><p>Gillian Rose (1947&#x2013;1995), who is now recognized as one of the most important and influential critical thinkers of her time, was a British philosopher and writer. For many years she taught at Sussex University, drawing large numbers of research students, before she accepted a chair in social and political thought at Warwick University. Her major works, which ranged from Continental philosophy to Judaism, include <i>The Melancholy Science</i>, <i>Hegel Contra Sociology</i>, <i>Dialectic of Nihilism</i>, <i>The Broken Middle: Out of Our Ancient Society</i>, <i>Judaism and Modernity</i>, <i>Mourning Becomes the Law</i>, and <i>Paradiso</i>.&nbsp;<br> Michael Wood teaches at Princeton and is the author, most recently, of <i>Yeats and Violence</i>.&#x201c;This beautiful memoir comes right from a genuinely thoughtful heart.

Weather inside: cozy and warm.</b></p><p><b>Enjoying life for once, or would be if Darcy hadn&#x2019;t gone off somewhere secret again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b></p><p><b>Why must he be so annoying!</b></p><p>By London standards, it was a dark and stormy night. Nothing like the wild gales that battered our castle in the Scottish Highlands, of course, but violent enough to make me glad I was safely indoors. Rain peppered the windows and drummed on the slates on the roof while a wild wind howled down the chimney. If I&#x2019;d been at Castle Rannoch, where I grew up, the wind would also have sent icy drafts rushing down the corridors, making tapestries flap and billow out so that it was almost as unpleasant indoors as it was out. But on this particular night I lay listening to the storm feeling snug, warm, comfortable and very thankful that I wasn&#x2019;t at Castle Rannoch. I was instead in my friend Belinda&#x2019;s mews cottage in Knightsbridge and enjoying every moment of it.</p><p>When I returned from America at the end of August&#x2014;having been dragged there by my mother who was seeking a quickie divorce from one of her husbands&#x2014;Mummy had immediately flitted away with the very briefest of good-byes as usual. She had abandoned her only child with monotonous regularity and barely a backward glance since that first time she bolted when I was two. But on this occasion she had actually demonstrated a spark of maternal feeling I hadn&#x2019;t known she possessed. As she left Brown&#x2019;s hotel she handed me a generous check. &#x201c;Georgie, darling, I want you to know that I think you behaved splendidly in Hollywood,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I simply couldn&#x2019;t have survived without you in that savage place.&#x201d;</p><p>I went pink and didn&#x2019;t quite know what to say as this was so out of character. &#x201c;Golly, thanks awfully,&#x201d; I managed to mumble.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to go back to Max in Germany, darling,&#x201d; she said, kissing me on the cheek, &#x201c;but I don&#x2019;t want you to think I&#x2019;m running out on you. You do know you are very welcome to come and stay whenever you want to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, but I don&#x2019;t think Berlin would be to my liking,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Not since that horrible little Hitler chappie came into power. Too much shouting and strutting.&#x201d;</p><p>She gave that tinkling laugh that had delighted audiences across the world. &#x201c;Oh, darling. Nobody takes him seriously. I mean, who could with a mustache like that. He once kissed my hand and it was like an encounter with a hedgehog. Max says he&#x2019;s good for German morale at the moment but he can&#x2019;t last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All the same, I&#x2019;d rather stay in good old England for a while,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That time in America was quite enough excitement for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mean to go home to Scotland?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Actually no,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly welcome at Castle Rannoch these days, and Belinda told me I could use her London house while she stays on in Hollywood.&#x201d; I added, &#x201c;And now you&#x2019;ve given me this check, I can actually afford to eat for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>A frown crossed that lovely face. &#x201c;Darling, have there been times when you couldn&#x2019;t afford to eat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oodles of them. I once survived for a month on tea and baked beans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How disgusting. Really, Georgie, if you need something just ask. Max is revoltingly rich, you know. I could get him to make you an allowance, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t live off Max&#x2019;s money, Mummy. Granddad wouldn&#x2019;t approve, for one thing. Not German money. You know how Granddad would hate that after your brother was killed in the war.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One must learn to forgive and forget, as I keep telling your grandfather. And once we&#x2019;re married&#x2014;well, it will be my money too, won&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; She raised her hands excitedly. &#x201c;You must come over for the wedding! You can be my maid of honor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really intend to marry him?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to look at her.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s what he wants, so I suppose the answer is yes. We&#x2019;ll just have to see, won&#x2019;t we? Well, I must be toddling off, darling, if I&#x2019;m to catch the boat train. Take care of yourself and for God&#x2019;s sake let that gorgeous Darcy take you to bed as soon as possible. Virginity simply isn&#x2019;t fashionable or even acceptable after twenty.&#x201d;</p><p>And with that she was gone. I had moved into Belinda&#x2019;s lovely little London mews home and had enjoyed playing a lady of leisure for a while. The one aspect of my happiness that was lacking was that Darcy was off on another secret assignment and I had no idea when he&#x2019;d return to London or how I could contact him. Really, he was the most infuriating man. I knew he did things that were often hush-hush (I suspected he might even occasionally work undercover for MI5) but an occasional postcard from Buenos Aires or Calcutta would have been nice.</p><p>A particularly violent gust of wind made the window frame rattle. I pulled the blankets up and curled into a little ball, enjoying the knowledge that I was safe and warm. The money that Mummy had given me wouldn&#x2019;t last forever, but I hoped at least I could stretch it out until after Christmas. If only I could find some kind of job, I could go on living here until Belinda came home&#x2014;and who knew when that would be if she became a successful costume designer in Hollywood. But jobs didn&#x2019;t seem to exist for young women like me, trained only to snare a husband. I was even toying with the idea of applying for a temporary Christmas job at one of the department stores, if I didn&#x2019;t think that the news might leak back to my relatives and cause a stink.</p><p>And in case you&#x2019;re wondering why my relatives should care if I worked behind the counter in Selfridges or Gamages I should point out that they were not exactly your run-of-the-mill, ordinary people&#x2014;they were the king and queen. My great-grandmother was Queen Victoria so I was half royal, expected to behave in a way that befitted my station without being given the means to do so. Jolly unfair, actually.</p><p>I pushed worrying thoughts aside. For the moment all was well. It had been remarkably peaceful, since my maid, Queenie, had been absent for the last few weeks. She had gone home to look after her mother, who had been hit by a tram while crossing Walthamtow High Street and broken her leg. But the leg had healed and Queenie was due to return to me any day now. I was anticipating it with mixed emotions since Queenie was the most utterly hopeless maid in the history of the universe. In fact I rather suspected that her family was urging her to hurry back to me, not because of any sense of duty but because they couldn&#x2019;t wait to get rid of her. I sighed, settled down and let my mind drift to more pleasant subjects. I was half asleep when I heard a noise that jerked me instantly awake again.</p><p>Over the noise of the wind and rain I had heard the distinct metallic click of a latch, followed by the sound of a door being opened. Somebody was coming into the house. I wondered if I had forgotten to lock the door before I went to bed, but I definitely remembered doing so. I was out of bed in a flash. Belinda&#x2019;s cottage was really tiny, with a flight of stairs leading up to the bedroom I was occupying, a bathroom and a minute maid&#x2019;s room. I looked around desperately. There was nowhere to hide if burglars had broken in. I examined the bed, but Belinda had piled boxes and trunks under it. The wardrobe was still full of her clothes. I wondered if perhaps I could tiptoe across the hall to the box room, or better yet the bathroom. Surely no burglar would think of looking in the bath?</p><p>I opened the door cautiously and was about to peer around it when I heard the sound of low voices in the hallway down below. Golly. More than one of them. I glanced back into the room to see if there was anything I might use as a weapon&#x2014;but I didn&#x2019;t think the frail china table lamp would be much good, even if I could unplug it in time. Then I heard a laugh that I recognized. Belinda&#x2019;s laugh. She had come home unexpectedly and she was probably talking to the taxi driver who was carrying in her luggage. I was about to step out to greet her when I heard her say, &#x201c;Toby, you are so naughty. Now stop that, at least until I have my gloves off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t wait, you delectable creature,&#x201d; said a deep man&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to rip off all your clothes, throw you down on that bed and give you one hell of a good ravishing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are certainly not going to rip anything,&#x201d; Belinda said, laughing again. &#x201c;I happen to like my clothes. But you may undress me as quickly as you like.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good show,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been dying to bed you since we first danced together on the ship. But too many watchful eyes. It was dashed clever of you to suggest coming back here rather than a hotel. A man in my position can&#x2019;t be too careful, don&#x2019;t you know.&#x201d;</p><p>Toby? I thought. Sir Toby Blenchley, cabinet minister? I had no time to consider this as they were now heading for the stairs. I stood behind that door in an agony of embarrassment and indecision. Surely she couldn&#x2019;t have forgotten that I was occupying her house, and thus her bedroom, could she? Did she really think it would be acceptable to roll in the hay with a cabinet minister while I was there? Where did she expect me to go while they were thus engaged? I sighed in exasperation. How typically Belinda.</p><p>I heard her giggle and say, &#x201c;My, but you are impatient, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; as they came up the stairs. What on earth was I to do? Leap out on them and say, &#x201c;Welcome home, Belinda, darling. Perhaps you had forgotten that you&#x2019;d lent your house to your best friend?&#x201d; Sir Toby wasn&#x2019;t in the first flush of youth. What if the surprise brought on a heart attack? On the other hand, there was now no way I could cross the upstairs landing to the maid&#x2019;s room, and I certainly didn&#x2019;t want to be trapped in there listening to their hijinks.</p><p>Then it was decided for me. Belinda ran up the rest of the stairs calling, &#x201c;Come on then, last one into bed is a sissy!&#x201d; She pushed open the bedroom door with full force, trapping me behind it. She had several robes hanging from the back of that door and these were now in my face. I heard the sounds of two people undressing hurriedly. Maybe if I kept quiet and didn&#x2019;t move he&#x2019;d have his way with her and then go, I decided. Better still, maybe they&#x2019;d both fall asleep and I could creep out and take refuge in the box room.</p><p>&#x201c;God, you really are delectable,&#x201d; I heard him say. &#x201c;Those neat little breasts. Enough to drive a man wild. Come here.&#x201d;</p><p>I heard bedsprings creak, a grunt, a sigh. Then something terrible happened. One of Belinda&#x2019;s robes was trimmed with feathers. And one of these feathers was now tickling my nose. To my horror I realized I was going to sneeze. I was pinned so tightly behind the door that it was hard for me to get my hand up to my nose. I managed it just in time and clamped my fingers over my nose and mouth. The noises on the bed were getting more violent and urgent. The sneeze was still lingering, waiting to come out the moment I let go. I willed it to go away but I had to breathe. And then, in spite of everything, it came out, a great big &#x201c;A&#x2014;choo,&#x201d; just at the moment when Belinda was moaning &#x201c;Oh yes, oh yes.&#x201d;</p><p>It was amazing how quickly the room fell silent.</p><p>&#x201c;What the devil was that?&#x201d; Sir Toby asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s in the house.&#x201d; I heard the bed creak as Belinda got up.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you said there&#x2019;d be nobody here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It must be my maid, although I didn&#x2019;t tell her I was coming home,&#x201d; Belinda said. &#x201c;How could she have known? I&#x2019;ll go and see if she&#x2019;s sleeping in her room.&#x201d; Then she lowered her voice. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go away, you big brute. I&#x2019;ll be back and we can continue from where we left off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not if your maid&#x2019;s in the house. Is she likely to gossip?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My maid is paid very well to close her eyes to anything that goes on in my bedroom,&#x201d; Belinda said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to worry, Toby, I promise you. I&#x2019;ll just get my robe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>And she swung the door open.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p></p><p></p><p><i>Chapter 2</i></p><p>It was fortunate that the storm outside was making such a racket or her scream would have been heard all the way to Victoria Station and maybe even across the Thames.</p><p>&#x201c;Belinda, it&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; I said, reaching out to touch her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me. Georgie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh God.&#x201d; She was gasping now, her hand over her naked heart. &#x201c;Georgie. Have you gone mad? What on earth are you doing hiding in my bedroom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry if I scared you, Belinda,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t intend to hide, but by the time I&#x2019;d woken up and heard you coming up the stairs it was too late to do anything sensible. And you were the one who pushed the door open so hard, trapping me behind it.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Toby was standing up beside the bed and had obviously just realized he was naked in the presence of a strange female. He grabbed a lace-trimmed, heart-shaped pillow and attempted to hold it over the important parts. He looked old and ridiculous and quite unlike the masterful, dapper man whose picture I had seen on newsreels and in magazines. &#x201c;You know this person, Belinda?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Should we call the police?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh no, of course not,&#x201d; Belinda said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s my best friend&#x2014;Georgiana Rannoch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lady Georgiana, sister of the Duke of Rannoch?&#x201d; Sir Toby said. &#x201c;Good God. But what&#x2019;s she doing in your house? In your bedroom, for God&#x2019;s sake?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve no idea, Toby.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d had enough. They were both looking at me with horror and suspicion as if I were a dangerous cornered animal. &#x201c;Perhaps in the heat of passion you forgot that you invited me to stay in your house while you were away, Belinda,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And you might have given me advance warning that you were coming back.&#x201d;</p><p>Belinda had taken down one of the robes and was in the process of trying to put it on. I noticed that her body was curvier than when we had shared a room as teenagers at a finishing school in Switzerland. No wonder men were so attracted to her.</p><p>&#x201c;I remember mentioning that you could use my house,&#x201d; Belinda said as she successfully pulled on the robe and tied it at her waist, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;d no idea that you&#x2019;d taken me up on it. You might have dropped me a note to tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dropped you a note?&#x201d; I was fully indignant now. &#x201c;Belinda, I wrote you two letters. And since I didn&#x2019;t know where you&#x2019;d be staying, I addressed one to you, care of Golden Pictures, and one, care of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Do you mean to tell me you didn&#x2019;t receive either of them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I didn&#x2019;t receive them. I never went back to Golden Pictures. It&#x2019;s been virtually shut down by Mr. Goldman&#x2019;s widow; at least all work is halted for now. And my budget certainly didn&#x2019;t run to the Beverly Hills Hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Toby cleared his throat. &#x201c;Given the circumstances, Belinda, I think I should depart as rapidly as possible. So if you young ladies don&#x2019;t mind stepping outside while I get dressed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Belinda followed me out onto the landing. &#x201c;Honestly, Georgie. You&#x2019;ve spoiled everything.&#x201d;</p><p>She stood there, glaring at me while I squirmed in embarrassment.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but you did offer and I did write to tell you. And I&#x2019;m not about to walk out into the storm at this hour so that you can finish your little tryst with a cabinet minister.&#x201d;</p><p>Sir Toby emerged, now looking more like himself i...</p></p><h2>The Complete Handbook of Sand Casting</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality,&nbsp;authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p></p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)</h2><p><p><b>Psychic cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse finds herself in the middle of big trouble of the supernatural kind in this novel in the #1 <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling series.<br></b><br>After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina, and the manmade horror of the explosion at the vampire summit, Sookie Stackhouse is safe but dazed, yearning for things to get back to normal.

She&#x2019;s been the bulwark of my existence, the foundation I was built on, and the best mother a woman could have.</p><p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p><p>A tip of the hat to Anastasia Luettecke, who was a perfectionist in supplying me with Octavia&#x2019;s Latin. And thanks to Murv Sellars for being the go-between. As always, I owe a great debt of thanks to Toni L. P. Kelner and Dana Cameron for their valuable comments and the gift of their time. My one and only minion, Debi Murray, assisted me with her encyclopedic knowledge of the Sookie universe. The group of enthusiastic readers known as Charlaine&#x2019;s Charlatans gave me moral (and morale) support, and I hope this book will serve as their reward.</p><p><i>If this was The Lord of the Rings and I had a smart British</i> voice like Cate Blanchett, I could tell you the background of the events of that fall in a really suspenseful way. And you&#x2019;d be straining to hear the rest.</p><p>But what happened in my little corner of northwest Louisiana wasn&#x2019;t an epic story. The vampire war was more of the nature of a small-country takeover, and the Were war was like a border skirmish. Even in the annals of supernatural America&#x2014;I guess they exist somewhere&#x2014;they were minor chapters . . . unless you were actively involved in the takeovers and skirmishes.</p><p>Then they became pretty damn major.</p><p>And everything was due to Katrina, the disaster that just kept on spreading grief, woe, and permanent change in its wake.</p><p>Before Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana had a flourishing vampire community. In fact, the vampire population of New Orleans had burgeoned, making it the place to go if you wanted to see vampires; and lots of Americans did. The undead jazz clubs, featuring musicians no one had seen playing in public in decades, were special draws. Vamp strip clubs, vamp psychics, vamp sex acts; secret and not-so-secret places where you could get bitten and have an orgasm on the spot: all this was available in southern Louisiana.</p><p>In the northern part of the state . . . not so much. I live in the northern part in a small town called Bon Temps. But even in my area, where vamps are relatively thin on the ground, the undead were making economic and social strides.</p><p>All in all, vampire business in the Pelican State was booming. But then came the death of the King of Arkansas while his wife, the Queen of Louisiana, was entertaining him soon after their wedding. Since the corpse vanished and all the witnesses&#x2014; except me&#x2014;were supernaturals, human law took no notice. But the other vampires did, and the queen, Sophie-Anne Leclerq, landed in a very dicey legal position. Then came Katrina, which wiped out the financial base of Sophie-Anne&#x2019;s empire. Still, the queen was floundering back from those disasters, when another one followed hard on their heels. Sophie-Anne and some of her strongest adherents&#x2014;and me, Sookie Stackhouse, telepath and human&#x2014;were caught in a terrible explosion in Rhodes, the destruction of the vampire hotel called the Pyramid of Gizeh. A splinter group of the Fellowship of the Sun claimed responsibility, and while the leaders of that anti-vampire &#x201c;church&#x201d; decried the hate crime, everyone knew that the Fellowship was hardly agonizing over those who were terribly wounded in the blast, much less over the (finally, absolutely) dead vampires or the humans who served them.</p><p>Sophie-Anne lost her legs, several members of her entourage, and her dearest companion. Her life was saved by her half-demon lawyer, Mr. Cataliades. But her recuperation time was going to be lengthy, and she was in a position of terrible vulnerability.</p><p>What part did I play in all this?</p><p>I&#x2019;d helped save lives after the pyramid went down, and I was terrified I was now on the radar of people who might want me to spend my time in their service, using my telepathy for their purposes. Some of those purposes were good, and I wouldn&#x2019;t mind lending a hand in rescue services from time to time, but I wanted to keep my life to myself. I was alive; my boyfriend, Quinn, was alive; and the vampires most important to me had survived, too. As far as the troubles Sophie-Anne faced, the political consequences of the attack and the fact that supernatural groups were circling the weakened state of Louisiana like hyenas around a dying gazelle ... I didn&#x2019;t think about it at all.</p><p>I had other stuff on my mind, personal stuff. I&#x2019;m not used to thinking much further than the end of my fingertips; that&#x2019;s my only excuse. Not only was I not thinking about the vampire situation, there was another supernatural situation I didn&#x2019;t ponder that turned out to be just as crucial to my future.</p><p>Close to Bon Temps, in Shreveport, there&#x2019;s a Were pack whose ranks are swollen by the men and women from Barksdale Air Force Base. During the past year, this Were pack had become sharply divided between two factions. I&#x2019;d learned in American History what Abraham Lincoln, quoting the Bible, had to say about houses divided.</p><p>To assume that these two situations would work themselves out, to fail to foresee that their resolution would involve me, well ... that was where I was almost fatally blind. I&#x2019;m telepathic, not psychic. Vampire minds are big relaxing blanks to me. Weres are difficult to read, though not impossible. That&#x2019;s my only excuse for being unaware of the trouble brewing all around me.</p><p>What was I so busy thinking about? Weddings&#x2014;and my missing boyfriend.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><i>I was making a neat arrangement of liquor bottles on the</i> folding table behind the portable bar when Halleigh Robinson rushed up, her normally sweet face flushed and tear-streaked. Since she was supposed to be getting married within an hour and was still wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt, she got my immediate attention.</p><p>&#x201c;Sookie!&#x201d; she said, rounding the bar to grab my arm. &#x201c;You have to help me.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d already helped her by putting on my bartending clothes instead of the pretty dress I&#x2019;d planned on wearing. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, imagining Halleigh wanted me to make her a special drink&#x2014; though if I&#x2019;d listened in to her thoughts, I&#x2019;d have known differently already. However, I was trying to be on my best behavior, and I was shielding like crazy. Being telepathic is no picnic, especially at a high-tension event like a double wedding. I&#x2019;d expected to be a guest instead of a bartender. But the caterer&#x2019;s bartender had been in a car wreck on her way over from Shreveport, and Sam, who&#x2019;d been unhired when E(E)E had insisted on using their own bartender, was abruptly hired again.</p><p>I was a little disappointed to be on the working side of the bar, but you had to oblige the bride on her special day. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I need you to be my bridesmaid,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah . . . what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tiffany fainted after Mr. Cumberland took the first round of pictures. She&#x2019;s on her way to the hospital.&#x201d;</p><p>It was an hour before the wedding, and the photographer had been trying to get a number of group shots out of the way. The bridesmaids and the groomsmen were already togged out. Halleigh should have been getting into her wedding finery, but instead here she was in jeans and curlers, no makeup, and a tear-streaked face.</p><p>Who could resist that?</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the right size,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And Tiffany is probably just about to have her appendix out. So, can you try on the dress?&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced at Sam, my boss.</p><p>Sam smiled at me and nodded. &#x201c;Go on, Sook. We don&#x2019;t officially open for business until after the wedding.&#x201d;</p><p>So I followed Halleigh into Belle Rive, the Bellefleur mansion, recently restored to something like its antebellum glory. The wooden floors gleamed, the harp by the stairs shone with gilt, the silverware displayed on the big sideboard in the dining room glowed with polishing. There were servers in white coats buzzing around everywhere, the E(E)E logo on their tunics done in an elaborate black script. Extreme(ly Elegant) Events had become the premier upscale caterer in the United States. I felt a stab in my heart when I noticed the logo, because my missing guy worked for the supernatural branch of E(E)E. I didn&#x2019;t have long to feel the ache, though, because Halleigh was dragging me up the stairs at a relentless pace.</p><p>The first bedroom at the top was full of youngish women in gold-colored dresses, all fussing around Halleigh&#x2019;s soon-to-be sister-in-law, Portia Bellefleur. Halleigh zoomed past that door to enter the second room on the left. It was equally full of younger women, but these were in midnight blue chiffon. The room was in chaos, with the bridesmaids&#x2019; civilian clothes piled here and there. There was a makeup and hair station over by the west wall, staffed by a stoic woman in a pink smock, curling rod in her hand.</p><p>Halleigh tossed introductions through the air like paper pellets. &#x201c;Gals, this is Sookie Stackhouse. Sookie, this is my sister Fay, my cousin Kelly, my best friend Sarah, my other best friend Dana. And here&#x2019;s the dress. It&#x2019;s an eight.&#x201d;</p><p>I was amazed that Halleigh had had the presence of mind to divest Tiffany of the bridesmaid dress before her departure for the hospital. Brides are ruthless. In a matter of minutes, I was stripped down to the essentials. I was glad I&#x2019;d worn nice underwear, since there wasn&#x2019;t any time for modesty. How embarrassing it would have been to be in granny panties with holes! The dress was lined, so I didn&#x2019;t need a slip, another stroke of luck. There was a spare pair of thigh-highs, which I pulled on, and then the dress went over my head. Sometimes I wear a ten&#x2014;in fact, most of the time&#x2014;so I was holding my breath while Fay zipped it up.</p><p>If I didn&#x2019;t breathe a lot, it would be okay.</p><p>&#x201c;Super!&#x201d; one of the other women (Dana?) said with great happiness. &#x201c;Now the shoes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; I said when I saw them. They were very high heels dyed to match the midnight blue dress, and I slid my feet into them, anticipating pain. Kelly (maybe) buckled the straps, and I stood up. All of us held our breath as I took a step, then another. They were about half a size too small. It was an important half.</p><p>&#x201c;I can get through the wedding,&#x201d; I said, and they all clapped.</p><p>"Over here then,&#x201d; said Pink Smock, and I sat in her chair and had more makeup reapplied over my own and my hair redone while the real bridesmaids and Halleigh&#x2019;s mother assisted Halleigh into her dress. Pink Smock had a lot of hair to work with. I&#x2019;ve only had light trims in the past three years, I guess, and it&#x2019;s way down past my shoulder blades now. My roommate, Amelia, had put some highlights in, and that had turned out real good. I was blonder than ever.</p><p>I examined myself in the full-length mirror, and it seemed impossible I could have been so transformed in twenty minutes.

The setting is a small village in southwestern Anatolia in the waning years of the Ottoman Empire. Everyone there speaks Turkish, though they write it in Greek letters. It&#x2019;s a place that has room for a professional blasphemer; where a brokenhearted aga finds solace in the arms of a Circassian courtesan who isn&#x2019;t Circassian at all; where a beautiful Christian girl named Philothei is engaged to a Muslim boy named Ibrahim. But all of this will change when Turkey enters the modern world. Epic in sweep, intoxicating in its sensual detail, <b>Birds Without Wings</b> is an enchantment.</p><p>Louis de Berni�res&#x2019;s first three novels are <b>The War of Don Emmanuel&#x2019;s Nether Parts</b> (Commonwealth Writers Prize, Best First Book Eurasia Region, 1991), <b>Se&#x2013;or Vivo and the Coca Lord</b> (Commonwealth Writers Prize, Best Book Eurasia Region, 1992), and <b>The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman</b>. The author was selected by Granta as one of the twenty Best of Young British Novelists in 1993. <b>Corelli&#x2019;s Mandolin</b> won the Commonwealth Writers Prize, Best Book, in 1995. His last book was<b> Red Dog</b>, published in 2001.<i>Editor's Note: At this point in the novel, Yusuf's daughter is pregnant by a Christian, leaving him with only one, terrible course of action...</i><br><br><b>The Tyranny of Honour</b><br><br>Yusuf the Tall loved all his children equally, with a passionate adoration that, when he thought about it, sometimes made him lachrymose. If his life were like a garden, then his daughters would be like the roses growing alongside its walls, and his sons would be like young trees that formed a palisade against the world. When they were small he devoted happy hours to their entertainment, and when they grew older he hugged them until their eyes bulged and they thought that their ribs would crack. He had grown to love his wife too, partly because this is what happens when a wife is well chosen, and partly because from her loins had sprung these brooks and becks of happiness.<br><br>But now Yusuf the Tall did not know what to do with his hands. It seemed as though they were behaving on their own. The thumb and middle finger of his left hand stroked across his eyeballs, meeting at the bridge of his nose. It was comforting, perhaps, for a scintilla of time. There was no comfort longer than that in this terrible situation. Sometimes his hands lay side by side on his face, the tips of his thumbs touching the lobes of his ears. He had thrown off his fez so that they could stroke his hair backwards, coming to rest on the back of his neck. The maroon fez lay in a corner on its side, so that his wife Kaya kept glancing at it. Despite this awful emergency, and the drama in which she was caught up, her instinct was to tidy it away, even if it were only to set it upright. She sat on the low divan, kneading her fingers, biting her lip and looking up at her husband. She was as helpless as one who stands before the throne of God.<br><br>Yusuf the Tall strode up and down the room, waving his hands, protesting and expostulating, sometimes burying his face in his hands. Kaya had not seen him so anguished and begrieved since the death of his mother three years before. He had painted the tulip on the headstone with his own hands, and had taken bread and olives so that he could eat at the graveside, imagining his mother underneath the stones, but unable to picture her as anything but living and intact.<br><br>Yusuf had passed the stage of anger. The time had gone when these patrollings of the room had been accompanied by obscenities so fearful that Kaya and her children had had to flee the house with their hands over their ears, their heads ringing with his curses against his daughter and the Christian:"Orospu �ocu�gu! Orospu �ocu�gu! Pi�!"<br><br>By now, however,Yusuf the Tall was in that state of grief which foreknew in its full import the horror of what was inescapably to come. His face glistened with anticipatory tears, and when he threw his head back and opened his mouth to groan, thick saliva strung itself across his teeth.<br><br>Overtaken, finally, by weariness, Kaya had given up pleading with him, partly because she herself could see no other way to deal with what had occurred. If it had been a Muslim, perhaps they could have married her to him, or perhaps they could have repeated what had been done with Tamara Hanim. Perhaps they could have kept her concealed in the house, unmarried for ever, and perhaps the child could have been given away. Perhaps they could have left it at the gates of a monastery. Perhaps they could have sent her away in disgrace, to fend for herself and suffer<br>whatever indignities fate and divine malice should rain upon her head. It had not been a Muslim, however, it had been an infidel.<br><br>Yusuf was an implacable and undeviating adherent to his faith. Originally from Konya, he was not like the other Muslims of this mongrel town who seemed to be neither one thing nor the other, getting converted when they married, drinking wine with Christians either overtly or in secret, begging favours in their prayers from Mary Mother of Jesus, not asking what the white meat was when they shared a meal, and being buried with a silver cross wrapped in a scrap of the Koran enfolded in their hands, just because it was wise to back both camels in salvation&#x2019;s race. Yusuf the Tall regarded such people with disdain. Moreover, it is one of the greatest curses of religion that it takes only the very slightest twist of a knife tip in the cloth of a shirt to turn neighbours who have loved each other into bitter enemies. He had lived serenely among Christians for most of his life, but now that she had despoiled and defiled herself with an infidel, this was the worst in all that tormented him.<br><br>Yusuf stopped pacing the room, and at last called his sons together. His other daughters assembled too, standing silent and cowed at the back of the darkened room.<br><br>When his sons were before him, Yusuf took his pistol from his sash, weighed it in his hand, took it by the barrel, and handed it to his second son, Sadettin. Sadettin took it by the butt, and looked at it in disbelief. At first his voice seemed to fail him. "Baba, not me," he said.<br><br>"I have tried," said Yusuf,"and I can&#x2019;t. I am ashamed, but I can&#x2019;t."<br><br>"Not me, Baba. Why me?"<br><br>"You have courage. Great courage. And you are obedient. This is my command."<br><br>"Baba!"<br><br>Yusuf beheld the spiritual and moral agony of his second son, and the surprise, but he would not relent.<br><br>"It should be Ekrem," pleaded his second son, gesturing towards the first-born. "Ekrem is oldest." Ekrem held out his hands as if to push his brother away, shaking his head vigorously.<br><br>"Ekrem will take my place when your mother dies," said Yusuf. "He is the first-born. You are all used to obeying him. He will be head of the family. It is you who must do this thing." He paused. "I command it."<br><br>Father and second son looked at each other for a long moment. "I command it," repeated Yusuf the Tall.<br><br>"I would rather kill myself," said Sadettin at last.<br><br>"I have other sons." Yusuf placed his hand on Sadettin&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>"I am your father."<br><br>"I will never forgive you," replied his second son.<br><br>"I know. Nonetheless, it is my decision. Sometimes . . ." and here he hesitated, trying to name whatever it is that takes our choices away, ". . . sometimes we are defeated."<br><br>Yusuf and Sadettin stood facing each other silently, and at the back of the room one of the girls began to sob. Sadettin appealed to his mother; kneeling before her and taking her hands in his, "Anneci�gim! Annece�gim!"<br><br>Kaya removed her hands from his grasp, and raised them in a small gesture of impotence. She seemed suddenly like an old woman who has turned her back on life.<br><br>"I command you," said Yusuf the Tall.<br><br>"It will be on your head," exclaimed Sadettin angrily, rising to his feet.<br><br>"On my head," repeated Yusuf.<br><br>Sadettin entered the haremlik. It was dark because the shutters were closed, and it smelled comfortingly of things feminine and mysterious. In the corner, glowing and glittering with terror in the half-light, he saw the eyes of his sweet sister, Bezmialem, of all his sisters the most gentle, and the one he loved the best.<br><br>"Sadettin," she murmured, her soft voice full of resignation. "I thought it would be Ekrem."<br><br>"I thought it would be him," said Sadettin.<br><br>She glanced at the pistol, placed her hand on her stomach and looked down. "You will kill both of us."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"The child is innocent."<br><br>Sadettin felt the pistol grow heavier in his hand. To himself he thought, "I won&#x2019;t defile my right hand" and he transferred it to his left.<br><br>"I am innocent," said Sadettin.<br><br>"We are all innocent," replied Bezmialem.<br><br>"You are not." He felt a sudden surge of anger. He blamed her for bringing down the shame, and for shutting him in this trap.<br><br>"I found something better than honour," she said, her eyes momentarily shining with happy remembrance.<br><br>"What is better than honour?"<br><br>"I don&#x2019;t know the name of it. But it is better. It makes me innocent."<br><br>Sadettin took his sister&#x2019;s right hand in his, knelt before her, and touched it to his heart, his lips and his forehead. He kissed it. He tried to suppress his pain, and he bowed his head. "It is not me who does this thing," he managed to say at last. He said it as quickly as he could, so that the words would not be throttled by sorrow and die in his throat.<br><br>"It is our father who does this," said his sister. "The injustice isn&#x2019;t yours."<br><br>"May God receive you in paradise," said Sadettin.<br><br>"May I see you there," replied Bezmialem.<br><br>"May the angels carry you."<br><br>"And you when the time comes."<br><br>Sadettin raised himself up and realised that after all he would have to defile his right hand. He transferred the pistol, threw his left arm around his sister&#x2019;s neck and embraced her. They stood<br>together, trembling. Softly she put her arms around him, as if he were a lover. He felt the soft pulse of her breath on his neck. He placed the muzzle of his pistol against her heart, clenched his eyes shut, muttered, "In the name of God . . ." and fired. He held Bezmialem to him as she choked and the spasms and convulsions overcame her. He thought that they would never end, and the dread came over him that he might have to go out, reload the pistol and shoot her again. For a desperate few seconds he wondered if it might not be possible to take her to a surgeon and save her. At last her head fell on his shoulder, and finally he let her down gently to the floor. He knelt and kissed her, the arc of his motion so familiar because so akin to the rituals of the mosque, and then he rested his forehead on hers.<br><br>When Sadettin emerged into the selamlik, his shirt was glistening with the dark blood that his sister had coughed up, and it was as if he had become another man. He threw the gun down at his father&#x2019;s feet in a brutal gesture of contempt, held his father&#x2019;s gaze, and wiped his hands so roughly together that they made a sound like clapping. "I have defiled my right hand because of you. I am finished with you all," he said.<br><br>"Where will you go?" asked his father.<br><br>"Where do the birds go?" asked Sadettin. He gestured in the direction of the Taurus Mountains, rising up from the Elysian coastal plain like a vast and sombre fortress. Behind them stretched the grim plains of the east, where a hard and uncouth people sat silently in the dark for months, doing nothing whilst they waited for the winter snows to melt.<br><br>"I am an outlaw," he said. "That is where I will be.With God&#x2019;s help, I shall not live long."<br><br>Sadettin left, taking nothing with him but a musket, and without kissing his father&#x2019;s hand, or touching it to his forehead, or to his heart.<br><br>Shortly afterwards Yusuf the Tall emerged from the house with the pistol restored to his sash, his fez brushed and restored to his head. A small and anxious crowd of people had gathered outside,wondering about the meaning of the shot. They had seen Sadettin leave in a fury, with his musket over his shoulder and the blood on his shirt, and his air of one who would never be able to bear a human touch again.<br><br>Ignoring these people,Yusuf set off down the steep and teeming alleyways.<br><br>He was affronted by the normality of the town. He stepped over the sleeping dogs, and skirted the kneeling camels. In the distance he could hear the Blasphemer railing against the priest. Little Philothei was being followed as usual by Ibrahim. Her friend Drosoula, as usual, had the devoted Gerasimos in tow. Abdulhamid Hodja rode by on Nilufer, her bells tinkling and her ribbons fluttering. Under his awning, Iskander the Potter worked at his wheel, and raised a lazy clay-caked hand in greeting. The goldfinch of Leonidas twittered in its cage outside the teacher&#x2019;s door. Ali the Snowbringer led his donkey by, its flanks wet and glistening from the melting packs of ice. Karatavuk in his black shirt, and Mehmet�ik in his red, played with stones under a fig tree. To Yusuf, all this ordinariness was like the mockery of God.<br><br>He found the two gendarmes playing backgammon together on a table in the shade of the plane trees of the meydan. As the day had grown warmer, so more of the buttons of their tunics had become undone. Both of them were in urgent need of the weekly shave that they would take that evening before Friday began. They looked up, not unduly pleased to be interrupted in their duty to the holy game of backgammon, and pronounced "Hos. geldiniz" in reluctant unison.<br><br>"Hos. bulduk," replied Yusuf, adding,"I am sorry to disturb you."<br><br>He drew the pistol from his sash, and laid it down gently on the board, so that he would not disturb the pieces. The gendarmes looked up at him in puzzlement and expectation.<br><br>"I am a murderer," declared Yusuf gently, "and I have come to offer myself for arrest."</p><h2>Saving Winslow</h2><p><p><strong>Indie Next List Pick </strong><strong>� </strong><strong>ALA Notable Children&#x2019;s Book </strong><strong>� </strong><strong>Texas Bluebonnet Award Winner</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;A winning tale of love.&#x201d; </strong><strong><em>&#x2014;</em></strong><strong><em>Kirkus </em>(starred review)</strong></p><p>Perfect for fans of <em>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web </em>and <em>The One and Only Ivan, Saving Winslow </em>is an uplifting modern classic in the making about a young boy who befriends an ailing newborn donkey and nurses him back to health, from <em>New York Times </em>bestseller and Newbery Medal winner Sharon Creech.</p><p>Louie doesn't have the best luck when it comes to nurturing small creatures.

The next novel, unfinished and untitled at the time of the author's death, would have been the chronicle of that mission, and much else besides. The three chapters left on O'Brian's desk are presented here both in printed version-including his corrections to the typescript-and a facsimile of his manuscript, which goes several pages beyond the end of the typescript to include a duel between Stephen Maturin and an impertinent officer who is courting his fianc�e.</p><p>Of course we would rather have had the whole story; instead we have this proof that O'Brian's powers of observation, his humor, and his understanding of his characters were undiminished to the end.</p><p><em>Includes a Facsimile of the Manuscript.</em></p></p><p>Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels has been described as &#34;a masterpiece&#34; (David Mamet, New York Times), &#34;addictively readable&#34; (Patrick T. Reardon, Chicago Tribune), and &#34;the best historical novels ever written&#34; (Richard Snow, New York Times Book Review), which &#34;should have been on those lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century&#34; (George Will).Set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, O&#39;Brian&#39;s twenty-volume series centers on the enduring friendship between naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician (and spy) Stephen Maturin. The Far Side of the World, the tenth book in the series, was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. The film was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture. The books are now available in hardcover, paperback, and e-book format.In addition to the Aubrey/Maturin novels, Patrick O&#39;Brian wrote several books including the novels Testimonies, The Golden Ocean, and The Unknown Shore, as well as biographies of Joseph Banks and Picasso. He translated many works from French into English, among them the novels and memoirs of Simone de Beauvoir, the first volume of Jean Lacouture&#39;s biography of Charles de Gaulle, and famed fugitive Henri Cherri�re&#39;s memoir Papillon. O&#39;Brian died in January 2000.For Aubrey/Maturin addicts, there could be no better gift: a new, albeit incomplete, story with freshly piquant details, wry humor and salty nautical action. Although the official word was that O'Brian had finished the series with 1999's <i>Blue at the Mizzen</i>, he was in fact working on a new installment at the time of his death in 2000. This short volume juxtaposes a facsimile of O'Brian's handwritten manuscript of the untitled novel with a printed version of the text, which corresponds to O'Brian's loosely edited, typed pages. As the tale opens, our heroes are off the coast of South America, trying to find a friendly place to put the <i>Surprise</i> in for victuals and water. Jack Aubrey has received the happy news that he has been given the rank of rear admiral of the Blue, and all is well for the time being. But the Catholic locals are surly at best to the mostly Protestant crew. To fix things, Stephen Maturin does some judicious buttering up and Aubrey reunites with Samuel Mputa, the region's Papal Nuncio and, incidentally, one of his "indiscretions" from his days as "a long-legged youth" serving on the South African station. The typescript of the third chapter ends mid-sentence, but the handwritten manuscript continues on to include a duel between Maturin and a romantic rival, leaving readers begging for more. Alas, this fragmentary but worthy addition to the series is truly the end of a literary era, leaving only readers' imaginations to fill in the rest of the story. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His lab is underfunded, his boss is incompetent, and his support staff is quirky, to say the least. But Siri&#x2019;s sense of humor gets him through his often frustrating days. When the body of the wife of a prominent politician comes through his morgue, Siri has reason to suspect the woman has been murdered. To get to the truth, Siri and his team face government secrets, spying neighbors, victim hauntings, Hmong shamans, botched romances, and other deadly dangers. Somehow, Siri must figure out a way to balance the will of the party and the will of the dead.</p><p>Colin Cotterill is the Dilys Award&#x2013;winning author of nine other books in the Dr. Siri Paiboun series: <i>Thirty-Three Teeth</i>, <i>Disco for the Departed</i>, <i>Anarchy and Old Dogs</i>, <i>Curse of the Pogo Stick</i>, <i>The Merry Misogynist</i>, <i>Love Songs from a Shallow Grave</i>, <i>Slash and Burn</i>, and <i>The Woman Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Die</i>, and <i>Six and a Half Deadly Sins</i>. He lives in Chumphon, Thailand, with his wife and five deranged dogs.<b>People&#x2019;s Democratic Republic of Laos, October 1976</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Tran, Tran, and Hok broke through the heavy end-of-wet-season clouds. The warm night air rushed against their reluctant smiles and yanked their hair vertical. They fell in a neat formation, like sleet. There was no time for elegant floating or fancy aerobatics; they just followed the rusty bombshells that were tied to their feet with pink nylon string.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tran the elder led the charge. He was the heaviest of the three. By the time he reached the surface of Nam Ngum reservoir, he was already ahead by two seconds. If this had been the Olympics, he would have scored a 9.98 or thereabouts. There was barely a splash. Tran the younger and Hok-the-twice-dead pierced the water without so much as a pulse-beat between them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quarter of a ton of unarmed ordnance dragged all three men quickly to the smooth muddy bottom of the lake and anchored them there. For two weeks, Tran, Tran, and Hok swayed gently back and forth in the current and entertained the fish and algae that fed on them like diners at a slow-moving noodle stall.<br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b>Vientiane, Two Weeks Later</b><br> &nbsp;<br> It was a depressing audience, and there were going to be a lot more like it. Now that Haeng, the spotty-faced magistrate, was back, Siri would have to explain himself every damn Friday, and kowtow to a man young enough to be his grandson.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the jargon of the Marxist&#x2013;Leninists, the sessions were known as &#x201c;burden-sharing tutorials.&#x201d; But after the first hour in front of Judge Haeng&#x2019;s warped plywood desk, Dr. Siri&#x2019;s burden had become <i>more </i>weighty. The judge, fresh off the production line, had taken great delight in casting un-expert doubts on Siri&#x2019;s reports and correcting his spelling.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And what do you put the loss of blood down to?&#x201d; Judge Haeng asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri wondered more than once whether he was deliberately being asked trick questions to establish the state of his mind. &#x201c;Well.&#x201d; He considered it for a moment. &#x201c;The body&#x2019;s inability to keep it in?&#x201d; The little judge h&#x2019;mmed and looked back down at the report. He wasn&#x2019;t even bright enough for sarcasm. &#x201c;Of course, the fact that the poor man&#x2019;s legs had been cut off above the knees might have had something to do with it. It&#x2019;s all there in the report.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You may believe it&#x2019;s all here in the report, Comrade Siri, but you seem to be very selective as to what information you share with your readers. I&#x2019;d like to see much more detail in the future, if you don&#x2019;t mind. And to be honest, I don&#x2019;t see how you can be so sure it was the loss of blood that killed him, rather than, say . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Heart failure?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Exactly. It would have been a terrible shock when his legs were severed. How do you know he didn&#x2019;t have a heart attack? He wasn&#x2019;t a young man.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With each of the previous three cases they&#x2019;d debated, Haeng had somehow twisted the facts around to the possibility of a natural death, but this was his most creative suggestion. It struck Siri that the judge would be delighted if all the case reports that came through his office were headed &#x201c;cardiac arrest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True, the fisherman&#x2019;s heart had stopped beating, but it was the signal announcing his death rather than the cause of it. The newly armor-plated military launch had crashed into the concrete dock at Tar Deua. With all the extra weight, it lay low in the water. Fortunately for the crew, the collision was cushioned by the longboat man standing in his little wooden craft against the wall, with no way to escape. Like a surprising number of fishermen on the Mekhong, he&#x2019;d never learned to swim.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overlapping metal deck sliced him apart like a scythe cutting through rice stalks, and the railing pinned him upright where he had been standing. The embarrassed captain and his crew pulled him&#x2014;his torso&#x2014;up onto the deck, where he lay in numb confusion, chattering and laughing as if he didn&#x2019;t know he was missing a couple of limbs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boat reversed and people on the bank watched the legs topple into the water and sink. They likely swelled up in a few hours and returned to the surface. They had worn odd flip-flops, so the chances of them being reunited in time for the funeral were poor. &#x201c;If you intend to cite a heart attack for every cause of death, I don&#x2019;t really see why we need a coroner at all, Comrade.&#x201d; Siri had reached his limit, and it was a limit that floated in a vast distant atmosphere. After seventy-two years, he&#x2019;d seen so many hardships that he&#x2019;d reached the calmness of an astronaut bobbing about in space. Although he wasn&#x2019;t much better at Buddhism than he was at communism, he seemed able to meditate himself away from anger. Nobody could recall him losing his temper.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Siri Paiboun was often described as a short-arsed man. He had a peculiar build, like a lightweight wrestler with a stoop. When he walked, it was as if his bottom half was doing its best to keep up with his top half. His hair, clipped short, was a dazzling white. Where a lot of Lao men had awakened late in life to find, by some miracle of the Lord above, their hair returned to its youthful blackness, Siri had more sensible uses for his allowance than Yu Dum Chinese dye. There was nothing fake or added or subtracted about him. He was all himself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d never had much success with whiskers, unless you counted eyebrows as whiskers. Siri&#x2019;s had become so overgrown, it took strangers a while to make out his peculiar eyes. Even those who&#x2019;d traveled ten times around the world had never seen such eyes. They were the bright green of well-lighted snooker-table felt, and they never failed to amuse him when they stared back from his mirror. He didn&#x2019;t know much about his real parents, but there had been no rumors of aliens in his blood. How he&#x2019;d ended up with eyes like these, he couldn&#x2019;t explain to anyone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty minutes into the &#x201c;shared burden tutorial,&#x201d; Judge Haeng still hadn&#x2019;t been able to look into those eyes. He&#x2019;d watched his pencil wagging. He&#x2019;d looked at the button dangling from the cuff of the doctor&#x2019;s white shirt. He&#x2019;d stared up through the broken louver window as if the red star were sparkling in the evening sky outside the walls of the Department of Justice. But he hadn&#x2019;t once looked into Siri&#x2019;s brilliant green eyes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Of course, Comrade Siri, we have to have a coroner because, as you well know, any organized socialist system must be accountable to its brothers and sisters. Revolutionary consciousness is maintained beneath the brilliance of the beam from the socialist lighthouse. But the people have a right to see the lighthouse keeper&#x2019;s clean underwear drying on the rocks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell, the boy was good at that: he was a master at coming up with exactly the wrong motto for the right situation. Everyone went home and analyzed their mottoes, and realized too late that they had no bearing on . . . anything. Siri stared at the sun-starved boy and felt kind of sorry for him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His only claim to respect was a Soviet law degree on paper so thin, you could see the wall where it hung through it. He&#x2019;d been trained, rapidly, to fill one of the many gaps left by the fleeing upper classes. He&#x2019;d studied in a language he didn&#x2019;t really understand and been handed a degree he didn&#x2019;t really deserve. The Soviets added his name to the roster of Asian communists successfully educated by the great and gloriously enlightened socialist Motherland.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri believed a judge should be someone who acquired wisdom layer by layer over a long life, like tree rings of knowledge, believed you couldn&#x2019;t just walk into the position by guessing the right answers to multiple choice tests in Russian.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can I go?&#x201d; Siri stood and walked toward the door without waiting for permission.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haeng looked at him like he was lower than dirt. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ll need to discuss attitude at our next tutorial. Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri smiled and resisted making a comment. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And, Doctor,&#x201d; the coroner stood with his nose to the door, &#x201c;why do you suppose the Democratic Republic issues quality black shoes to its government officials free of charge?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri looked down at his ragged brown sandals. &#x201c;To keep Chinese factories open?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Haeng lowered his head and moved it from side to side in slow motion. It was a gesture he&#x2019;d learned from older men, and it didn&#x2019;t quite suit him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We have left the jungle, Comrade. We have escaped from the caves. We now command respect from the masses, and our attire reflects our standing in the new society. Civilized people wear shoes. Our comrades expect it of us. Do you understand what I&#x2019;m telling you?&#x201d; He was speaking slowly now, like a nurse to a senile patient.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siri turned back to him with no sign that he&#x2019;d been humiliated. &#x201c;I believe I do, Comrade. But I think if the proletariat are going to kiss my feet, the least I can do is give them a few toes to wrap their lips around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He yanked open the sticky door and left.</p><h2>In the Reign of Terror: A Story of the French Revolution (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Return to the tumultuous days of the French Revolution with this captivating tale of adventure and courage.

These include the upsurge of religious fundamentalism, with more political power today than ever before; the failure of public education to create an informed citizenry; the triumph of internet over print culture; and America's toxic addition to infotainment. Combining historical analysis with contemporary observation and sparing neither the right nor the left, Susan Jacoby asserts that Americans today have embraced "junk thought" that makes almost no effort to separate fact from opinion. <br><br> At today's critical political juncture, nothing could be more important than recognizing the crisis described in this impassioned, tough-minded book, which challenges Americans to face the painful truth about what the flights from reason has cost us as individuals and as a nation.</p><p>SUSAN JACOBY is the author of twelve previous books, most recently <i>Strange Gods</i>, <i>Never Say Die, The Great Agnostic: Robert Ingersoll and American Freethought, The Age of American Unreason, Alger Hiss and the Battle for History, Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism, and Half-Jew: A Daughter's Search for Her Family's Buried Past</i>.

Only a few decades ago, Americans were addressed as people or, in the more distant past, ladies and gentlemen. Now we are all folks. Television commentators, apparently confusing themselves with the clergy, routinely declare that &#x201c;our prayers go out to those folks&#x201d;&#x2014;whether the folks are victims of drought, hurricane, flood, child molestation, corporate layoffs, identity theft, or the war in Iraq (as long as the victims are American and not Iraqi). Irony is reserved for fiction. Philip Roth, in <i>The Plot Against America</i>&#x2014;a dark historical reimagining of a nation in which Charles Lindbergh defeats Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election&#x2014;confers the title &#x201c;Just Folks&#x201d; on a Lindbergh program designed to de-Judaize young urban Jews by sending them off to spend their summers in wholesome rural and Christian settings.<br><br>While the word &#x201c;folks&#x201d; was once a colloquialism with no political meaning, there is no escaping the political meaning of the term when it is reverently invoked by public officials in twenty-first-century America. After the terrorist bombings in London on July 7, 2005, President Bush assured Americans, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been in contact with our homeland security folks and I instructed them to be in touch with local and state officials about the facts of what took place here and in London and to be extra vigilant as our folks start heading to work.&#x201d; Bush went on to observe that &#x201c;the contrast couldn&#x2019;t be clearer, between the intentions of those of us who care deeply about human rights and human liberty, and those who&#x2019;ve got such evil in their heart that they will take the lives of innocent folks.&#x201d; Those evil terrorists. Our innocent folks. Even homeland security officials, who&#x2014;one lives in hope&#x2014;are supposed to be highly trained experts, cannot escape the folkish designation. All of the 2008 presidential contenders pepper their speeches with appeals to folks, but only John Edwards, who grew up poor in North Carolina, sounds as if he was raised around people who actually used the word in everyday conversation. Every time Hillary Rodham Clinton, brought up in a conservative Republican household in an upper-middle-class suburb of Chicago, utters the word &#x201c;folks,&#x201d; she sounds like a hovering parent trying to ingratiate herself with her children&#x2019;s friends by using teenage slang.<br><br>The specific political use of folks as an exclusionary and inclusionary signal, designed to make the speaker sound like one of the boys or girls, is symptomatic of a debasement of public speech inseparable from a more general erosion of American cultural standards. Casual, colloquial language also conveys an implicit denial of the seriousness of whatever issue is being debated: talking about folks going off to war is the equivalent of describing rape victims as girls (unless the victims are, in fact, little girls and not grown women). Look up any important presidential speech in the history of the United States before 1980, and you will not find one patronizing appeal to folks. Imagine: <i>We here highly resolve that these folks shall not have died in vain . . . and that government of the folks, by the folks, for the folks, shall not perish from the earth.</i> In the 1950s, even though there were no orators of Lincoln&#x2019;s eloquence on the political scene, voters still expected their leaders to employ dignified, if not necessarily erudite, speech. Adlai Stevenson may have sounded too much like an intellectual to suit the taste of average Americans, but proper grammar and respectful forms of address were mandatory for anyone seeking high office.<br><br>The gold standard of presidential oratory for adult Americans in the fifties was the memory of Roosevelt, whose patrician accent in no way detracted from his extraordinary ability to make a direct connection with ordinary people. It is impossible to read the transcripts of FDR&#x2019;s famous fireside chats and not mourn the passing of a civic culture that appealed to Americans to expand their knowledge and understanding instead of pandering to the lowest common denominator. Calling for sacrifice and altruism in perilous times, Roosevelt would no more have addressed his fellow citizens as folks than he would have uttered an obscenity over the radio. At the end of 1940, attempting to prepare his countrymen for the coming of war, the president spoke in characteristic terms to the public:<br><br>"Tonight, in the presence of a world crisis, my mind goes back eight years to a night in the midst of a domestic crisis . . . I well remember that while I sat in my study in the White House, preparing to talk to the people of the United States, I had before my eyes the picture of all those Americans with whom I was talking. I saw the workmen in the mills, the mines, the factories; the girl behind the counter; the small shopkeeper; the farmer doing his spring plowing; the widows and the old men wondering about their life&#x2019;s savings. I tried to convey to the great mass of the American people what the banking crisis meant to them in their daily lives.<br><br>Tonight I want to do the same thing, with the same people, in this new crisis which faces America. . . .<br><br>We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to the task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war. . . .<br><br>As president of the United States I call for that national effort. I call for it in the name of this nation which we love and honor and which we are privileged and proud to serve. I call upon our people with absolute confidence that our common cause will greatly succeed."[1]<br><br>Substitute folks for people, farmer, old men, and widows, and the relationship between the abandonment of dignified public speech and the degradation of the political process becomes clear. To call for resolution and a spirit of patriotism and sacrifice is to call upon people to rise above their everyday selves and to behave as true citizens. To keep telling Americans that they are just folks is to expect nothing special&#x2014;a ratification and exaltation of the quotidian that is one of the distinguishing marks of anti-intellectualism in any era.<br><br>The debasement of the nation&#x2019;s speech is evident in virtually everything broadcast and podcast on radio, television, and the Internet. In this true, all-encompassing public square, homogenized language and homogenized thought reinforce each other in circular fashion. As George Orwell noted in 1946, &#x201c;A man may take to drink because he feels himself a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.&#x201d;[2] In this continuous blurring of clarity and intellectual discrimination, political speech is always ahead of the curve&#x2014;especially because today&#x2019;s media possess the power to amplify and spread error with an efficiency that might have astonished even Orwell. Consider the near-universal substitution, by the media and politicians, of &#x201c;troop&#x201d; and &#x201c;troops&#x201d; for &#x201c;soldier&#x201d; and &#x201c;soldiers.&#x201d; As every dictionary makes plain, the word &#x201c;troop&#x201d; is always a collective noun; the &#x201c;s&#x201d; is added when referring to a particularly large military force. Yet each night on the television news, correspondents report that &#x201c;X troops were killed in Iraq today.&#x201d; This is more than a grammatical error; turning a soldier&#x2014;an individual with whom one may identify&#x2014;into an anonymous-sounding troop encourages the public to think about war and its casualties in a more abstract way. Who lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Troop? It is difficult to determine exactly how, why, or when this locution began to enter the common language. Soldiers were almost never described as troops during the Second World War, except when a large military operation (like the Allied landing on D-Day) was being discussed, and the term remained extremely uncommon throughout the Vietnam era. My guess is that some dimwits in the military and the media (perhaps the military media) decided, at some point in the 1980s, that the word &#x201c;soldier&#x201d; implied the masculine gender and that all soldiers, out of respect for the growing presence of women in the military, must henceforth be called troops. Like unremitting appeals to folks, the victory of troops over soldiers offers an impressive illustration of the relationship between fuzzy thinking and the debasement of everyday speech.<br><br>By debased speech, I do not mean bad grammar, although there is plenty of that on every street corner and talk show, or the prevalence of obscene language, so widespread as to be deprived of force and meaning at those rare times when only an epithet will do. Nor am I talking about Spanglish and so-called Black English, those favorite targets of cultural conservatives&#x2014;although I share the conservatives&#x2019; belief that public schools ought to concentrate on teaching standard English. But the standard of standard American English, and the ways in which private speech now mirrors the public speech emanating from electronic and digital media, is precisely the problem. Debased speech in the public square functions as a kind of low-level toxin, imperceptibly coarsening our concept of what is and is not acceptable until someone says something so revolting&#x2014;Don Imus&#x2019;s notorious description of femal...</p><h2>Bad Business (Spenser)</h2><p>One of the great series in the history of the American detective story gets even better when Spenser is hired by a jilted bride to follow a cheating husband, only to cross paths with a detective hired to tail the two-timing wife. They aren&#39;t the most trusting couple in town, but as it turns out, they are the most dangerous.</p><p>When Marlene Cowley hires Spenser to see if her husband Trent is cheating on her, he encounters more than he bargained for: not only does he find a two-timing husband, but a second investigator as well, hired by the husband to look after his wife. As a result of their joint efforts, Spenser soon finds himself investigating both individual depravity and corporate corruption.<br><br>It seems the folks in the Cowleys' circle have become enamored of radio talk show host Darrin O'Mara, whose views on Courtly Love are clouding some already fuzzy minds with the notion of cross-connubial relationships. O'Mara's brand of sex therapy is unconventional at best, unlawful--and deadly--at worst. Then a murder at Kinergy, where Trent Cowley is CFO, sends Spenser in yet another direction. Apparently, the unfettered pursuit of profit has a price.<br><br>With razor sharp characterizations and finely honed prose, this is Parker at the height of his powers.<br><i>From the Compact Disc edition.</i>Robert B.

During World War II, the truest glimpse most Americans got of the "real war" came through the flashing black lines of twenty-two-year-old infantry sergeant Bill Mauldin. Week after week, Mauldin defied army censors, German artillery, and Patton's pledge to "throw his ass in jail" to deliver his wildly popular cartoon, "Up Front," to the pages of <em>Stars and Stripes</em>. "Up Front" featured the wise-cracking Willie and Joe, whose stooped shoulders, mud-soaked uniforms, and pidgin of army slang and slum dialect bore eloquent witness to the world of combat and the men who lived&#x2015;and died&#x2015;in it.This taut, lushly illustrated biography&#x2015;the first of two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Bill Mauldin&#x2015;is illustrated with more than ninety classic Mauldin cartoons and rare photographs. It traces the improbable career and tumultuous private life of a charismatic genius who rose to fame on his motto: "If it's big, hit it." 92 illustrations</p><p><p>Born in 1921, <strong>Bill Mauldin</strong> squeezed several lifetimes into his eighty-one years.

Though he seized the White House in a landslide against the imploding Whig Party, he proved a dismal failure in office.</p><p>Michael F. Holt, a leading historian of nineteenth-century partisan politics, argues that in the wake of the Whig collapse, Pierce was consumed by an obsessive drive to unify his splintering party rather than the roiling country. He soon began to overreach. Word leaked that Pierce wanted Spain to sell the slave-owning island of Cuba to the United States, rousing sectional divisions. Then he supported repeal of the Missouri Compromise, which limited the expansion of slavery in the west. Violence broke out, and "Bleeding Kansas" spurred the formation of the Republican Party. By the end of his term, Pierce's beloved party had ruptured, and he lost the nomination to James Buchanan.</p><p>In this incisive account, Holt shows how a flawed leader, so dedicated to his party and ill-suited for the presidency, hastened the approach of the Civil War.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael F.

He was the sixth child of Anna Kendrick Pierce and General Benjamin Pierce, who also had a daughter from a previous marriage. Pierce later described his mother as affectionate and endlessly forgiving of his youthful hijinks, but it was his far sterner father, the most influential man in Hillsborough County, who had the greater impact on him. A native of Chelmsford, Massachusetts, Benjamin Pierce had enlisted in the Continental army as a teenager as soon as he heard about the fighting at Lexington and Concord. He fought in the battles of Breed's Hill and Ticonderoga, among others, and spent the winter with George Washington at Valley Forge. He was mustered out of the army with a medal from Washington, and at the rank of lieutenant, in 1784. In short, he had the credentials of a Revolutionary War hero, and his war stories inspired young Franklin with a desire to emulate his father's military service. That two of his older brothers as well as his half sister's husband fought in the War of 1812 intensified this yen.</p><p>His reputation as a war hero served Benjamin Pierce well when he moved to the frontier town of Hillsborough in western New Hampshire in 1786. Not only would he quickly become the commanding general of the state's militia, but he was also elected to several terms as the county's sheriff, where he became famous for his generosity toward jailed debtors. He also sat on the governor's council. In the late 1820s, he served two one-year terms as governor of the state. Benjamin Pierce was a Jeffersonian Republican who loathed Federalists as elitist snobs, and that hatred deepened when a Federalist majority in the state legislature purged him from the office of sheriff after he had defied an order from a Federalist judge.</p><p>Frank Pierce was hardly a bookish youth. He loved the outdoors and enjoyed roughhousing, swimming, fishing, and ice skating far more than lessons in school. Even as a boy he evinced the personal charm that would smooth his political rise. He was his playmates' ringleader, and adults, especially adult women, found him an altogether winning lad&#x2014;honest, polite, and poised. To put it differently&#x2014;and perhaps more ominously&#x2014;from boyhood on Pierce was eager to please other people. Pierce did not like school, but his father, who lacked a formal education of his own, was determined that his sons attend college. Thus Pierce was dispatched to a series of academies outside Hillsborough to learn Latin and Greek in preparation for the required college entrance exams. One of Pierce's older brothers had attended West Point and another Dartmouth College. When the time came to send Frank off to college, however, Federalists controlled Dartmouth, and Benjamin Pierce would not consider it. He determined instead to send Frank to Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine.</p><p>Pierce and his parents arrived in Brunswick for the beginning of the 1820 fall term several months before Frank's sixteenth birthday. Bowdoin was then a very small college, but it attracted an astonishing number of young men destined for national eminence. William Pitt Fessenden, the future Whig and Republican U.S. senator from Maine, was in the class ahead of Pierce's, and James Bradbury, a future Democratic senator from Maine, was in the student body at the same time. John P. Hale, who would later run against Pierce for president, was a freshman when Pierce was a senior. Calvin Stowe, the future husband of Harriet Beecher Stowe, was valedictorian of Pierce's class. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was in the class of 1825, and two other members of that class would play important roles in Pierce's future life. One was Jonathan Cilley of New Hampshire, later a Democratic congressman who lived in the same boardinghouse with Pierce in Washington during one of his congressional terms. The other was Nathaniel Hawthorne, who remained Pierce's lifelong friend and who would write a campaign biography for him in 1852.</p><p>While he struggled with mathematics, Pierce's training in classical languages served him well&#x2014;indeed too well&#x2014;during his first years at Bowdoin. The cold fact is that during his first two years, Pierce played far more than he studied. He frequently skipped mandatory recitation periods in order to hike in the nearby woods or fish in nearby streams. In the dormitory at night, when solitary study was the prescribed regimen, Pierce was famous for bursting into other students' rooms to start furniture-smashing wrestling matches. He usually won those contests. Ten years later, a fellow Democratic state legislator with whom Pierce tussled described him as &#x201c;the most powerful man of his size I know of.&#x201d; Wrestling was not Pierce's only nighttime activity in those first years at Bowdoin. In violation of the school's rules, Pierce and his closest pals snuck out of the dorm to frequent a Brunswick tavern.</p><p>Heavy drinking and Pierce's name go together like a horse and carriage, and years later his political opponents would label him a drunkard. In the 1820s, young men were as likely as those today to seek amusement and drink heavily in bars, and there seems little doubt that the gregarious and fun-loving Pierce enjoyed socializing with his friends. From his perspective, not to do so would be an insult to those friends. It appears that his tolerance for alcoholic intake was low and that he often became riotously giddy much sooner than his drinking partners. But there is no evidence that Pierce's drinking sprees impaired his mental faculties once he had sobered up. Some of Pierce's behavior then and especially after he left the White House suggests that he suffered from alcoholism, but at this distance in time it is impossible to render a definitive diagnosis.</p><p>As a result of Pierce's carefree behavior, he ranked dead last academically in his class by the end of his sophomore year at Bowdoin. When he learned of his embarrassing status, he determined to reform. Gone were the hikes in the woods and the evenings in the tavern. Instead of copying other students' work to turn in as his own as he had done for two years, he arose at 4 a.m. every morning to hit the books. Overseeing this transformation to academic self-discipline was a new member of his class, a devout Methodist from Maine named Zenas Caldwell, who brought Pierce home with him during the midwinter break. In his senior year, Pierce roomed with the sober-minded Caldwell, and with the help of his strict supervision the onetime dunce graduated fifth in his class, now reduced to fourteen students, and had the honor of delivering a seven-minute disquisition in Latin at graduation in August 1824.</p><p>Pierce was far too fun-loving and far too addicted to outdoor exercise, however, to become a total bookworm. In the spring of his junior year he organized a military company called the Bowdoin Cadets, which &#x201c;Captain&#x201d; Pierce led in marching drills around the campus. Like most colleges in that day, Bowdoin boasted rival debating societies, and during Pierce's senior year, the impending presidential election of 1824 became the focus of their competition. One of these societies proclaimed the merits of John Quincy Adams, while, tellingly, Pierce's club touted those of Andrew Jackson.</p><p>After graduation Pierce returned to his parents' house in Hillsborough and began to read law with a local attorney. He moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in the spring of 1825 to study in the office of Levi Woodbury and, after Woodbury left to serve in the U.S. Senate, to another lawyer in Northampton, Massachusetts. He completed his legal studies in Amherst, New Hampshire, the Hillsborough county seat, and was admitted to the bar there in September 1827, two months shy of his twenty-third birthday. He then returned to Hillsborough to start his practice.</p><p>The interest Pierce developed in national politics at Bowdoin quickened during his months in Portsmouth, a former Federalist and now pro-Adams bastion. Like other supporters of Andrew Jackson, Pierce was infuriated by the so-called Corrupt Bargain that had placed Adams in the White House. He sympathized with the efforts of Woodbury and Isaac Hill, a&nbsp;Concord editor, to organize a pro-Jackson opposition party. &#x201c;A&nbsp;Republic without parties is a complete anomaly,&#x201d; he wrote a friend. &#x201c;The citizens are convinced that Jeffersonian principles are the principles for a free people, and I trust they have no notion of renouncing their faith.&#x201d;</p><p>Pierce put these beliefs into practice when he returned to Hillsborough. In 1827 his father was elected governor for the first time with no organized opposition, but in 1828, the presidential election year, pro-Adams men rallied to stop his reelection. Frank Pierce campaigned aggressively for his father. He helped organize a pro-Jackson demonstration on the anniversary of Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans in January. Two months later, Frank made his formal political debut at the annual Hillsborough town meeting. Town meetings in New Hampshire did more than discuss local affairs. They also cast votes each year for state officials and, in odd years, for U.S. congressmen. Hillsborough, like many other New Hampshire towns, was divided between Adams and Jackson men. To the surprise of many, Jacksonians elected young Frank Pierce moderator of the meeting, as they would during the next five successive years. That, however, was the only Pierce victory that March. Benjamin's bid for reelection failed, an accurate portent of Jackson's defeat in New Hampshire in the presidential election the following November. Yet Benjamin, now openly aligned with the Jacksonians, would win the governorship again in March 1829, and at the Hillsborough town meeting that year Franklin Pierce, barely twenty-four years old, was unanimously elected to the state legislature. The town meeting repeated that choice over the next three years, and in the final two of them Pierce's admiring colleagues in the state house of representatives elected him their Speaker.</p><p>R...</p></p><h2>Meridian</h2><p>Meridian Hill is a young woman at an Atlanta college attempting to find her place in the revolution for racial and social equality.

They looked at him as he got out of his car and lifted their Coca-Colas in a slight salute. They were seated on two boxes in the garage, out of the sun, and talked in low, unhurried voices while Truman chewed on a candy bar and supervised the young white boy, who had come scowling out of the station office to fill up the car with gas. Truman had driven all night from New York City, and his green Volvo was covered with grease and dust; crushed insects blackened the silver slash across the grill.<br><br> "Know where I can get this thing washed?" he called, walking toward the garage.<br><br> "Sure do," one of the men said, and rose slowly, letting the last swallow of Coke leave the bottle into his mouth. He had just lifted a crooked forefinger to point when a small boy dressed in tattered jeans bounded up to him, the momentum of his flight almost knocking the older man down.<br><br> "Here, wait a minute," said the man, straightening up. "Where's the fire?"<br><br> "Ain't no fire," said the boy, breathlessly. "It's that woman in the cap. She's staring down the tank!"<br><br> "Goodness gracious," said the other man, who had been on the point of putting half a doughnut into his mouth. He and the other man wiped their hands quickly on their orange monkey suits and glanced at the clock over the garage. "We've got time," said the man with the doughnut.<br><br> "I reckon," said the other one.<br><br> "What's the matter?" asked Truman. "Where are you going?"<br><br> The boy who had brought the news had now somehow obtained the half-doughnut and was chewing it very fast, with one eye cocked on the soda that was left in one of the bottles.<br><br> "This town's got a big old army tank," he muttered, his mouth full, "and now they going to have to aim it on the woman in the cap, 'cause she act like she don't even know they got it."<br><br> He had swallowed the doughnut and also polished off the drink. "Gotta go," he said, taking off after the two service station men who were already running around the corner out of sight.<br><br>The town of Chicokema did indeed own a tank. It had been bought during the sixties when the townspeople who were white felt under attack from "outside agitators"-those members of the black community who thought equal rights for all should extend to blacks. They had painted it white, decked it with ribbons (red, white, and of course blue) and parked it in the public square. Beside it was a statue of a Confederate soldier facing north whose right leg, while the tank was being parked, was permanently crushed.<br><br> The first thing Truman noticed was that although the streets around the square were lined with people, no one was saying anything. There was such a deep silence they did not even seem to be breathing; his own footsteps sounded loud on the sidewalk. Except for the unnatural quiet it was a square exactly like that in hundreds of small Southern towns. There was an expanse of patchy sunburned lawn surrounding a brick courthouse, a fringe of towering pine and magnolia trees, and concrete walks that were hot and clean, except for an occasional wad of discarded chewing gum that stuck to the bottoms of one's shoes.<br><br> On the side of the square where Truman now was, the stores were run-down, their signs advertising tobacco and Olde Milwaukee beer faded from too many years under a hot sun. Across the square the stores were better kept. There were newly dressed manikins behind sparkling glass panes and window boxes filled with red impatiens.<br><br> "What's happening?" he asked, walking up to an old man who was bent carefully and still as a bird over his wide broom.<br><br> "Well," said the sweeper, giving Truman a guarded look as he clutched his broom, supporting himself on it, "some of the children wanted to get in to see the dead lady, you know, the mummy woman, in the trailer over there, and our day for seeing her ain't till Thursday."<br><br> "Your day?"<br><br> "That's what I said."<br><br> "But the Civil Rights Movement changed all that!"<br><br> "I seen rights come and I seen 'em go," said the sweeper sullenly, as if daring Truman to disagree. "You're a stranger here or you'd know this is for the folks that work in that guano plant outside town. Po' folks."<br><br> "The people who don't have to work in that plant claim the folks that do smells so bad they can't stand to be in the same place with 'em. But you know what guano is made out of. Whew. You'd smell worse than a dead fish, too!"<br><br> "But you don't work there, do you?"<br><br> "Used to. Laid off for being too old."<br><br> Across the square to their left was a red and gold circus wagon that glittered in the sun. In tall, ornate gold letters over the side were the words, outlined in silver, "Marilene O'Shay, One of the Twelve Human Wonders of the World: Dead for Twenty-Five Years, Preserved in Life-Like Condition." Below this, a smaller legend was scrawled in red paint on four large stars: "Obedient Daughter," read one, "Devoted Wife," said another. The third was "Adoring Mother" and the fourth was "Gone Wrong." Over the fourth a vertical line of progressively flickering light bulbs moved continually downward like a perpetually cascading tear.<br><br> Truman laughed. "That's got to be a rip-off," he said.<br><br> "Course it is," said the sweeper, and spat. "But you know how childrens is, love to see anything that's weird."<br><br> The children were on the opposite side of the square from the circus wagon, the army tank partially blocking their view of it. They were dressed in black and yellow school uniforms and surrounded somebody or something like so many bees. Talking and gesticulating all at once, they raised a busy, humming sound.<br><br> The sweeper dug into his back pocket and produced a pink flier. He handed it to Truman to read. It was "The True Story of Marilene O'Shay."<br><br> According to the writer, Marilene's husband, Henry, Marilene had been an ideal woman, a "goddess," who had been given "everything she thought she wanted." She had owned a washing machine, furs, her own car and a fulltime housekeeper-cook. All she had to do, wrote Henry, was "lay back and be pleasured." But she, "corrupted by the honeyed tongues of evildoers that dwell in high places far away," had gone outside the home to seek her "pleasuring," while still expecting him to foot the bills.<br><br> The oddest thing about her dried-up body, according to Henry's flier, and the one that-though it only reflected her sinfulness-bothered him most, was that its exposure to salt had caused it to darken. And, though he had attempted to paint her her original color from time to time, the paint always discolored. Viewers of her remains should be convinced of his wife's race, therefore, by the straightness and reddish color of her hair.<br><br> Truman returned the flier with a disgusted grunt. Across the square the children had begun to shuffle and dart about as if trying to get in line. Something about the composition of the group bothered him.<br><br> "They are all black," he said after a while, looking back at the sweeper. "Besides, they're too small to work in a plant."<br><br> "In the first place," said the sweeper, pointing, "there is some white kids in the bunch. They sort of overpower by all the color. And in the second place, the folks who don't work in the guano plant don't draw the line at the mamas and papas, they throw in the childrens, too. Claim the smell of guano don't wash off.<br><br> "That mummy lady's husband, he got on the good side of the upper crust real quick: When the plant workers' children come round trying to get a peek at his old salty broad while some of them was over there, he called 'em dirty little bastards and shoo'em away. That's when this weird gal that strolled into town last year come in. She started to round up every one of the po' kids she could get her hands on. She look so burnt out and weird in that old cap she wear you'd think they'd be afraid of her-they too young to 'member when black folks marched a lot-but they not."<br><br> Catching his breath, Truman stood on tiptoe and squinted across the square. Standing with the children, directly opposite both the circus wagon and the tank, was Meridian, dressed in dungarees and wearing a light-colored, visored cap, of the sort worn by motormen on trains. On one side of them, along the line of bright stores, stood a growing crowd of white people. Along the shabby stores where Truman and the sweeper stood was a still-as-death crowd of blacks. A white woman flew out of the white crowd and snatched one of the white children, slapping the child's shoulders as she hustled it out of sight. With alarm, Truman glanced at the tank in the center of the square. At that moment, two men were crawling into it, and a phalanx of police, their rifles pointing upward, rushed to defend the circus wagon.<br><br> It was as if Meridian waited for them to get themselves nicely arranged. When the two were in the tank and swinging its muzzle in her direction, and the others were making a line across the front of the wagon, she raised her hand once and marched off the curb. The children fell into line behind her, their heads held high and their feet scraping the pavement.<br><br> "Now they will burst into song," muttered Truman, but they did not.<br><br> Meridian did not look to the right or to the left. She passed the people watching her as if she didn't know it was on her account they were there. As she approached the tank the blast of its engine starting sent a cloud of pigeons fluttering, with the sound of rapid, distant shelling, through the air, and the muzzle of the tank swung tantalizingly side to side-as if to tease her-before it settled directly toward her chest. As she drew nearer the tank, it seemed to grow larger and whiter than ever and she seemed smaller and blacker than ever. And then, when she reached the tank she stepped lightly, deliberately, right in front of it, rapped smartly on its carapace-as if knocking on a door-then raised her...</p><h2>This Moment Is Your Life (and So Is This One): A Fun and Easy Guide to Mindfulness, Meditation, and Yoga</h2><p><b>This lively, hands-on guide to meditation, mindfulness, and yoga is a perfect introduction for tweens and teens.</b><br><br><i>Don't just do something, be here.</i><br><br>The key to happiness is being able to find comfort in this moment, here and now.

Through proportion and harmony, the musical scale bridges the gap between two extremes. It encapsulates the most fundamental pattern of harmonic symmetry and demonstrates how the phenomena of nature are inseparably related to one another through the principle of reciprocity. Because of these relationships embodied in its structure, the musical scale was seen as an ideal metaphor of human society by Plato and other Pythagorean thinkers, for it is based on the cosmic principles of harmony, reciprocity, and proportion, whereby each part of the whole receives its just and proper share. <p></p>This book is the first ever complete translation of The Manual of Harmonics by the Pythagorean philosopher Nicomachus of Gerasa (second century A.D.) published with a comprehensive, chapterbychapter commentary. It is a concise and wellorganized introduction to the study of harmonics, the universal principles of relation embodied in the musical scale. Also included is a remarkable chapterbychapter commentary by the translator, Flora Levin, which makes this work easily accessible to the reader today. Dr. Levin explains the principles of Pythagorean harmony, provides extensive background information, and helps to situate Nicomachus' thought in the history of ideas. <p></p>This important work constitutes a valuable resource for all students of ancient philosophy, Western cosmology, and the history of music.</p><p>One can see from this book why harmonics was so important to the Greeks: Like modern physics it gave entrance to the mystery of the world&#39;s construction and to the intelligence latent thereinFlora Levin is an independent scholar of the classical world.

Renowned music journalist Simon Reynolds celebrates the futurist spirit of such bands as Joy Division, Gang of Four, Talking Heads, and Devo, which resulted in endless innovations in music, lyrics, performance, and style and continued into the early eighties with the video-savvy synth-pop of groups such as Human League, Depeche Mode, and Soft Cell, whose success coincided with the rise of MTV. Full of insight and anecdotes and populated by charismatic characters, <b>Rip It Up and Start Again</b>&nbsp;re-creates the idealism, urgency, and excitement of one of the most important and challenging periods in the history of popular music.</p><p>Simon Reynolds is the author of <i>Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture</i>, <i>Blissed Out: The Raptures of Rock</i>, and <i>The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock &#x2019;n&#x2019;Roll</i> (coauthored with Joy Press). A senior contributing writer for <i>Spin</i>, his pop culture writings have also appeared in many other major publications.In the reactionary wake of 1970s punk rock came postpunk, a more complex, fragmented brand of music characterized by stark recordings, synthesizers and often cold, affected vocals. Postpunk stands as "a fair match for the Sixties," argues Reynolds, both in terms of the amount of great music created as well as the music's connection to the "social and political turbulence" of its era (the early 1980s). Seeking to address a gap in music and pop culture history, Reynolds (<i>Generation Ecstasy</i>) has penned an ambitious, cerebral effort to establish a high place in rock history for bands such as Joy Division, Devo, Talking Heads, Mission of Burma and, of course, Public Image Limited (PiL), fronted by former Sex Pistols singer John Lydon (Johnny Rotten). Reynolds, an energetic writer, especially captures the postpunk ethic in telling the story of PiL's short journey from record company darlings to utter oblivion. Unfortunately, by the time he gets to bands like Human League and Frankie Goes to Hollywood, his passion is undermined by his subject. Reynolds succeeds in depicting the icons and the richness of an era that clearly manifests itself as a primary influence among a new generation of musicians. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This captivating anthology features 27 of his most treasured retellings of fairy tales.<br>Featured fables include "Cinderella," "Beauty and the Beast," "Rapunzel," "Little Red Riding Hood," "Rumpelstiltskin," and other classics.

Latino/Latina Studies. Translated from the Spanish by John Pluecker.<br> <br> <em>What is a body when it's lost?</em><br><br> ANT�GONA GONZ�LEZ is the story of the search for a body, a specific body, one of the thousands of bodies lost in the war against drug trafficking that began more than a decade ago in Mexico. A woman, Ant�gona Gonz�lez, attempts to narrate the disappearance of Tadeo, her elder brother. She searches for her brother among the dead. San Fernando, Tamaulipas, appears to be the end of her search.<br> <br> But Sara Uribe's book is also a palimpsest that rewrites and cowrites the juxtapositions and interweavings of all the other Antigones. From the foundational <em>Antigone</em> of Sophocles passing through Griselda Gambaro's <em>Ant�gona furiosa</em>, Leopoldo Marechal's <em>Ant�gona V�lez</em>, Mar�a Zambrano's <em>La tumba de Ant�gona</em> all the way to <em>Antigone's Claim</em> by Judith Butler. And this book's writing machine includes testimonies from family members of the victims and fragments and fragments from news stories that provide accounts of all these absences, all the bodies that we are missing.<br> <br> "This brilliant and moving book revives the story of Antigone to confront the horrifying violence shrouded within the present landscape&#x2014;Antigone, a solitary figure before the law, facing certain death, who invokes a way of resistance at once textual and political. Sophocles' play resonates throughout this act of poetic testimony and fierce interpretation, making emphatic graphic marks precisely where there is no trace of loss."&#x2014;Judith Butler<br> <br> "Sara Uribe's ANT�GONA GONZ�LEZ reads as if written by the Emily Dickinson of Tamaulipas in response to the loss and violence occurring all around her&#x2014;it is that intimate, honest, unaffected, intelligent, urgent, innovative, spare, and beautiful. I am so happy that this landmark of contemporary Mexican literature is now available in the United States."&#x2014;Francisco Goldman<br><br> "As the families of so many disappeared throughout Mexico, Sara Uribe's ANT�GONA GONZ�LEZ roams a convulsed land looking for the body of Tadeo, her brother. As urgent as it is delicate, ANT�GONA GONZ�LEZ summons the dead and brings them to our tables, for the day we cease sharing memory and language with them, we ourselves will become loss, vanished sign, oblivion."&#x2014;Cristina Rivera- Garza</p><p>Born in 1978 in Quer�taro, Sara Uribe has lived in Tamaulipas since 1996.

I do these dozens of times,repositioning enlarging, reducing, adding and omitting. There are always hundreds of sketches foreach book. It sounds tedious, but it is the most exciting part of creating a book. When I msatisfied with these, I do the final art. All of my work is done on opaline parchment, a thin butstrong paper. I sketch lightly in pencil and use water colors applied with very fine sable brushes.Sometimes I use color pencils with the paint to soften the atmosphere."<br><br>Diane Goode now lives in Watchung, New Jersey, with her husband David, an author and collegeprofessor.

This extraordinary bestseller continues to top every genre in which she writes. With more than 30 million copies of her books in print in more than one hundred countries, her current series include The Dark-Hunters, The League, and Chronicles of Nick. Her Chronicles of Nick series is soon to be a major motion picture. And the Dark-Hunters will soon be gracing both the big and little screens.As the best-selling Dark-Hunter series about the centuries-spanning adventures of the immortal warriors of Atlantis enters its second decade, international phenom Kenyon extends the story of her most popular character, Acheron (Acheron, 2008), to include his identical twin, Styxx. Styxx appears to have it all, but the apparent glamor and privilege of being the crown prince of Didymos is merely an illusion. The king has impossible expectations for Styxx and doesn&#x2019;t understand that every beating he gives Acheron, whom he hates, is also felt by his twin. When the twins were young children, the only peace Styxx experienced was when he and Acheron lay down with the soles of their feet touching. As a teenager, Styxx goes to Atlantis and attempts to rescue Acheron from their cruel uncle, who viciously retaliates. For the next 11,000 years, the brothers despise each other. Kenyon&#x2019;s epic tale of sibling rivalry and hatred fueled by the manipulations of gods from multiple pantheons features enough depravity and underhanded politics to give The Game of Thrones a run for its money.

In order to lower levels of Police mortality at the hands of Chinese Tongs, he studied ancient Chinese and Japanese martial arts, including Ju-jitsu, and was the first foreigner to be awarded a black belt in the discipline. He developed his own system which he called &#x2018;Defendu&#x2019;. At the outbreak of the Second World War, he was recruited by Britain&#x2019;s Special Operations Executive as an Instructor in unarmed combat and expounded the deadly mysteries of attack and defence to scores of&nbsp; trainee agents about to be dropped into occupied Europe. His methods were approved and officially adopted throughout the British army. Fairbairn also developed weapons and defence aids such as bullet proof vests. He is best known as the co-inventor of the famous Sykes-Fairbairn knife. In this book he&nbsp; expounds his distilled experience of unarmed combat. Fully illustrated, it shows how to deliver deadly blows with hand, fist, knee and boot; wrist, bear- and strangle holds (and how to break them);&nbsp; how to throw an enemy, and how to break their backs; how to disarm a pistol-wielding attacker; and securing a prisoner.

New ideas and discoveries not only redefined what human beings believed, knew, and could do, but also forced them to redefine themselves with respect to the strange new worlds revealed by ships and scalpels, telescopes and microscopes, experimentation and contemplation. Explanatory systems were made, discarded, and remade by some of the best-known names in the entire history of science--Copernicus, Galileo, Newton--and by many others less recognized but no less important. In this Very Short Introduction Lawrence M. Principe explores the exciting developments in the sciences of the stars (astronomy, astrology, and cosmology), the sciences of earth (geography, geology, hydraulics, pneumatics), the sciences of matter and motion (alchemy, chemistry, kinematics, physics), the sciences of life (medicine, anatomy, biology, zoology), and much more. The story is told from the perspective of the historical characters themselves, emphasizing their background, context, reasoning, and motivations, and dispelling well-worn myths about the history of science.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lawrence M.

Working alongside skilled photographers, Rockwell acted as director, carefully orchestrating models, selecting props, and choosing locations for the photographs--works of art in their own right--that served as the basis of his iconic images. Readers will be surprised to find that many of his most memorable characters-the girl at the mirror, the young couple on prom night, the family on vacation-were friends and neighbors who served as his amateur models. In this groundbreaking book, author and historian Ron Schick delves into the archive of nearly 20,000 photographs housed at the Norman Rockwell Museum. Featuring reproductions of Rockwell's black-and-white photographs and related full-color artworks, along with an incisive narrative and quotes from Rockwell models and family members, this book will intrigue anyone interested in photography, art, and Americana.&nbsp;</p><p>Check my "Norman Rockwell: Behind the Camera" Facebook page for frequent updates:&nbsp;facebook.com/NormanRockwellBehindtheCamera.Ron Schick is a writer and editor specializing in the history of photography.

At the forefront of this breakthrough stood Enrico Fermi. Straddling the ages of classical physics and quantum mechanics, equally at ease with theory and experiment, Fermi truly was the last man who knew everything--at least about physics. But he was also a complex figure who was a part of both the Italian Fascist Party and the Manhattan Project, and a less-than-ideal father and husband who nevertheless remained one of history's greatest mentors. Based on new archival material and exclusive interviews, <i>The Last Man Who Knew Everything </i>lays bare the enigmatic life of a colossus of twentieth century physics.<br></p><p><b>David N. Schwartz</b> holds a PhD in political science from MIT and is the author of two previous books. He has worked at the State Department Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, and at Goldman Sachs in a variety of roles in both London and New York. He lives in New York with his wife, Susan. His father, Melvin Schwartz, shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1988."Mr. Schwartz deftly conveys the aesthetic beauty of Fermi's insights without getting mired in their minutiae."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Economist </i></b></i></b><br><br>"There have been other accounts of his life, yet David N. Schwartz's new portrait, <i>The Last Man Who Knew Everything</i>, is the first thorough biography to be published since Fermi's death 64 years ago in 1954. Schwartz, working with limited sources, tells the story well...[His] biography adds importantly to the literature of the utterly remarkable men and women who opened up nuclear physics to the world."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Times Book Review </i></b></i></b><br><br>"[Schwartz] does an admirable job of explaining the science and provides careful assessments of Fermi's influence... [and illuminates] the human effects of a project that was so urgent yet so terrible in its long-term implications."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Foreign Affairs </i></b></i></b><br><br>"Schwartz's <i>The Last Man Who Knew Everything</i> offers the most comprehensive description of Fermi's work so far, as well as fresh insights into his personality."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Nature</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Last Man Who Knew Everything</i> manages the neat double trick of making both Fermi and his abstruse work accessible to readers living in the world he did so much to create, for good and ill."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b></i></b><br><br>"An informative and fun read, rich in those anecdotes and tales that...help to elucidate what was driving the work of the giant that Fermi was.... The more mundane aspects of Fermi's life--his fears, vanities and human errors, emerge...from these pages."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Physics World</i></b></i></b><br><br>"David Schwartz's elegant narrative is a formidable achievement, shining a bright light on Enrico Fermi, the most enigmatic physicist of the early atomic era. Schwartz has exhausted the archives and crafted what will certainly stand as the most deeply biographical account of this brilliant scientist's tragically short life." &#x2015;<b><i><b>Kai Bird</b>, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer and co-author with Martin J. Sherwin of <i>American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer</i></i></b><br><br>"It is testimony to David N. Schwartz's excellence as a biographer that he can reveal the workaholic Fermi to have been such a fascinatingly complex figure... [Schwartz] excels in a portrayal that is balanced and nuanced, sympathetic but unflinching."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>The Spectator </i>(UK)</b></i></b><br><br>"A lucid writer who has done his homework, Schwartz...delivers a thoroughly enjoyable, impressively researched account...Never a media darling like Einstein or Oppenheimer, Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) is now barely known to the public, but few scientists would deny that he was among the most brilliant physicists of his century...A rewarding, expert biography of a giant of the golden age of physics."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Told in a sure, steady voice, Schwartz's book delivers a scrupulously researched and lovingly crafted portrait of the 'greatest Italian scientist since Galileo.'"&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i></b></p><h2>Ancient Map for Modern Birth</h2><p>The integrative model of childbirth described in this book will provide women with the information needed to prepare for birth, how to think and feel about labor, and how to tell their story. During their childbearing year, women traverse two paths at once: an inner path of psychological and spiritual awareness and an outer path of practical approaches to birth in modern-day culture. The book combines scientific research with meditation, ceremony, art, and mythic stories, which not only prepares childbearing women to go beyond their edge into uncharted territory but to find their way home again. The underlying message throughout is not to strive for a perfect birth but to be mindful of the mythic journey, of all the mothers who have come before&#x2014;an awareness that leads not only to the birth of a child but to the birth of a new self.</p><p>Through her observations and experiences as a nurse-midwife and mother (who birthed once by cesarean, once at home), Pam realized the need for a radically new model of childbirth preparation and a birth story process.

My father was a Cardinals fan, as was my grandfather. When I was a kid growing up in the rural south, everyone listened to the Cardinals on the radio. We seldom missed a game. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>What's your most memorable game--as player, coach, or fan?<br> <b>A: </b>I played a lot of baseball when I was a kid and teenager, but I do not recall making any spectacular plays. When I coached baseball, my teams usually lost. As a fan, Game 6 of the World Series last year, Cardinals vs. Rangers, comes to mind. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Have you played or coached baseball? What position?<br> <b>A: </b>I was an average high school baseball player with big dreams. I tried to play in college, but got myself cut in the fall practices. I was an outfielder with a weak arm. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Why are there seemingly more baseball books--both fiction and nonfiction--than other sports?<br> <b>A: </b>Baseball is a uniquely American sport, and it is the oldest organized sport in the country. It has a rich and colorful history, and up until the last generation, it was the most popular sport for kids to play. Sadly, that is changing. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Who was the Joe Castle of your childhood--a player you revered? And was there a Warren Tracey?<br> <b>A: </b>I was never much of a Red Sox fan, but I adored Tony Conigliaro. He was a great player, and a certain Hall of Famer. The beanball that struck him in the eye ruined a great career. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>While researching <i>Calico Joe</i>, did you attend or watch games? Did you write any of the book at a stadium?<br> <b>A: </b>I only write in one place, and that's my office at home. I take a lot of notes when I travel around and research, which I did for <i>Calico Joe</i>. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Did you employ any other behind-the-scenes techniques--watch old footage, interview players, read old issues of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>?<br> <b>A: </b>Yes, all of the above. I interviewed several former major league players. I read lots of old magazines, news articles, and books about baseball, and specifically, <i>The Code</i>. I found some footage of famous beanball wars of recent times. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Do the beanball or the brushback have a place in today's baseball? Even Joe seemed to accept them as "part of the game."<br> <b>A: </b>Yes. There are times in baseball when a particular hitter must get hit. There are many reasons for this, but retaliation is always a factor. Problems arise though when the pitch is above the shoulders, and aimed at batter's head. If a pitcher does this intentionally, and they do it all the time, they are fooling around with a player's career. Throwing at a batter's head is never acceptable in baseball, even as retaliation. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Have you ever been hit? Have you ever hit someone else?<br> <b>A: </b>Every baseball player gets hit. Fortunately, I was never beaned in the head. Our coaches never let me anywhere near the pitcher's mound, so I never hit a batter. <br><br> <b>Q: </b>Do you love baseball? If so, why? Any concerns that the sport and its stars (as Warren gripes in the book) have changed?<br> <b>A: </b>I still love baseball but it's not the game of my youth. The pro game today is dominated by money and, frankly, there is a lot of bad baseball being played. I find it frustrating, but I always get pumped at World Series time. College baseball is far more exciting.<b>John Grisham</b> is the author of twenty-five novels, including, most recently, <i>The Racketeer; </i>one work of nonfiction; a collection of stories; and a series for young readers.

The recently published <i>Palm Beach, Finland</i>&nbsp;has been a massive critical success, with Marcel Berlins of <i>The Times</i>&nbsp;calling him &#x2018;the funniest writer in Europe&#x2019;, and making it one of his books of the year."Dark and thrilling, funny and intelligent, this&nbsp;<i>Fargo</i>-like novel contains lethal doses of humour&#x2014;and mushrooms." &#x2014;Sofi Oksanen, author,&nbsp;<i>Purge</i><br><br>&nbsp;&#x201c;This one is a winner right from the first sentence.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>&#x201c;a tightly paced Scandinavian thriller with a wicked sense of humor and a bumbling ne&#x2019;er -do-well at its center.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Foreword Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;[a] relentlessly funny crime novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Brimming with black comedy and unexpected pathos, this is a clever and witty book."&#x2014;<b>Geek.com</b></p><h2>Damned Lies and Statistics: Untangling Numbers from the Media, Politicians, and Activists</h2><p>Here, by popular demand, is the updated edition to Joel Best's classic guide to understanding how numbers can confuse us.

The main image is of a triumphant President Ronald Reagan, reasonably viewed as the most effec�tive president of recent decades. A second set of images comes from the bombing of a government building in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh, a man linked to shadowy parts of the contemporary ultraright. The roots of Reaganism are conservative, intellectual, and political movements of the 1950s and 1960s, including currents that in those years were considered marginal and ex�tremist. The roots of the ultraright of the 1990s have intersecting though by no means identical sources.</p> <p>Serious evaluation of the American right should begin with <em>The Radical Right. </em>It describes the main positions and composition of distinctive forces on the right in the first half of the 1950s and the next decade. It recognizes the right's vehement opposition to domestic and international Communism, its sharp rejec�tion of the New Deal, and its difficulty in distinguishing between the two. Bell's controversial point of departure is to regard the basic position of what he terms the radical right as excessive in its estimation of the Communist threat and unrealistic in its rejection of New Deal reforms. From this starting point, Bell and his authors evaluate the ways the right went beyond programs and the self-descriptions of its leaders and organizers.</p> <p><em>The Radical Right </em>explains McCarthyism and its successors in terms of conflicts over social status and the shape of American culture. Daniel Bell focuses on the social dislo�cation of significant groups in the post-New Deal decades. Many members of these groups perceived themselves as dispossessed and victimized by recent changes, even if it was not possible to regard them as having undergone any great suffering.</p> <p>David Plotke's major new introduction discusses the book's argument, McCarthyism and American politics, the changing shape of the American right from 1965-2000, mili�tias, and new issues in American politics. This edition also includes an afterword by Daniel Bell responding to Plotke's interpretation and revisiting his own perspectives.</p></p><p><p> <em>Daniel Bell</em>&nbsp;(1919-2011) was professor emeritus of sociology at Harvard University and is best known for his work and contributions to post-industrialism.

Trying to compete with her husband and Droma was too exhausting, and, ultimately, pointless. At times it seemed their affinity wasn&#x2019;t entirely amicable, but it was perfectly natural. They&#x2019;d hardly stopped talking since the Ryn had come aboard. Bringing each other up to date on events since they&#x2019;d parted at Fondor, they covered everything from sneaky tactics to Anakin&#x2019;s death. After the latter, Droma had left the bridge for a while, to sing a plaintive lay in a language Leia didn&#x2019;t understand, but then he&#x2019;d returned with a story about one of his exploits in the Senex sector. The tale was as tall as a Bolenian hillspinner,<br>but it served its purpose by easing the pall of melancholy that had engulfed the <i>Falcon</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;So they started taking apart the tanker module,&#x201d; Han<br>was saying now, relating one of his own stories to Droma,<br>his mood far removed from the grief that had consumed<br>him earlier.<br><br>&#x201c;Which you said was filled with liquid hydrogen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but destroying the tanker didn&#x2019;t stop the hydrogen.<br>If anything, it spread out a little, exactly as<br>planned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Droma asked, frowning. &#x201c;Hydrogen won&#x2019;t<br>burn without oxygen.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Goldenrod said. That&#x2019;s the trouble with<br>droids: no imagination. As our shields failed, I told Leia<br>and Jacen to punch holes through the cruiser&#x2019;s hull with<br>our quads. Before I could tell those scarheads to eat ions,<br>there was more than enough oxygen for the hydrogen to<br>react with. The cruiser went up so fast we had a tough<br>time dodging the pieces. After that, it was just a matter of<br>getting out of there. The few skips we left behind weren&#x2019;t<br>putting up much of a fight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Understandably. I hear Vong skips are useless once<br>they&#x2019;re cut off from their yammosks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;re not completely useless,&#x201d; Han said, &#x201c;but<br>it does give you an advantage.&#x201d;<br><br>Droma shrugged. &#x201c;Speaking of yammosks, I&#x2019;ve heard<br>some stories about them that would make your tail stand<br>on end!&#x201d;<br><br>Leia listened to the banter but offered nothing toward<br>the conversation. Instead, she concentrated on the information<br>Droma had provided them: communications had<br>indeed been lost with the Unknown Regions. The destruction<br>of the base on Generis and the attack on Esfandia appeared<br>to be the source of the disruption. A free-floating<br>proto-world, Esfandia had long since cut free from whatever<br>star had given birth to it, but still had enough radioactivity<br>bubbling in its core to sustain a liquid atmosphere.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t the most hospitable of places, but it didn&#x2019;t need<br>to be. A skeleton crew of about a dozen people, mainly<br>technicians, normally inhabited the relay outpost, which<br>had been hastily converted from a scientific station at<br>the beginning of the war with the Yuuzhan Vong. Since<br>Luke&#x2019;s mission had entered the Unknown Regions, the<br>Galactic Alliance&#x2019;s military presence around Esfandia had<br>been upgraded to two squadrons of X-wings and a frigate<br>by the name of <i>Corellian Way</i>. What had happened to<br>those forces was unknown. The relay staff only had time<br>to broadcast a message alerting their superiors on Mon<br>Calamari that they were under attack by the Yuuzhan<br>Vong before all communications had been lost.<br><br>That wasn&#x2019;t necessarily a sure sign of disaster. The<br>relay base was designed to resist such attacks. Imperial<br>AT-AT technology had been adapted to the cold soup of<br>Esfandia&#x2019;s environment, creating a giant, mechanical, crablike<br>construction capable of moving from place to place<br>at a slow but steady pace. Such mobility was an advantage,<br>given that most of the world was studded with<br>receivers sensitive enough to detect transmissions from<br>deep in the Unknown Regions. The base was designed to<br>circumnavigate the globe, maintaining the receivers, while<br>the technicians remained safely inside. That the ability to<br>move made it easier to hide when attacked was a bonus.<br><br>The base, therefore, could have simply gone to ground,<br>tucked away in a crevasse or under the thick silt of the atmospheric<br>soup. If it could be found, it could be reactivated.<br>Assuming, of course, that the Yuuzhan Vong hadn&#x2019;t<br>found it first and destroyed it for good.<br><br>Leia sent her thoughts outward, far beyond her location<br>in hyperspace, beyond Esfandia and whatever awaited<br>them there, to her brother, Luke. The last message Cal<br>Omas had received from him suggested he&#x2019;d found a<br>promising lead and was setting off to investigate. He<br>hadn&#x2019;t specified what that lead consisted of or where he<br>was headed, and now there was no way they would know<br>unless they repaired the communications outage. Leia<br>had no doubt that, were anything terrible to happen to<br>him, then she would know about it. She would <i>feel </i>it,<br>just as she had in the past. Nevertheless, she was concerned.<br>So much was invested in his mission&#x2014;personally,<br>and on a galactic scale&#x2014;that if something were to go<br>wrong, it would be a disaster of unimaginable proportions.<br><br>The conversation between her husband and his old<br>friend shifted as the <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s console began to beep and<br>flash, announcing that they were nearing their destination.<br><br>&#x201c;Right on the nose,&#x201d; Han said proudly, flipping switches<br>in readiness for the return to realspace.<br><br>&#x201c;And we didn&#x2019;t even have to get out and push,&#x201d;<br>Droma said dryly.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s real amusing,&#x201d; Han returned without<br>smiling. &#x201c;Now you want to move your funny, fuzzedup<br>self out of that chair so Leia can come forward and<br>help me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s all right, Han,&#x201d; she said as Droma began<br>to stand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Droma can manage.&#x201d;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t say that she was enjoying the break from<br>routine, but it was interesting to watch Han&#x2019;s interaction<br>with the Ryn. Memories of the terrible time when Han<br>had pulled away from her while grieving for Chewbacca<br>still stung, but only Droma had witnessed how low Han<br>had really sunk back then. If having the Ryn aboard did<br>remind Han of those painful times, he certainly wasn&#x2019;t<br>letting it show.<br><br>&#x201c;You remember how to operate the copilot&#x2019;s board?&#x201d;<br><br>Han asked Droma without looking up from what he was<br>doing.<br><br>&#x201c;Follow orders, and curse when something goes<br>wrong,&#x201d; Droma replied with a smile. &#x201c;Which it invariably<br>does.&#x201d;<br><br>Han affected an indignant expression on behalf of his<br>beloved freighter. &#x201c;Hey, she may be old&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But she&#x2019;s still got it where it counts, right?&#x201d; Droma<br>said.<br><br>&#x201c;What have I told you about doing that?&#x201d; Han said<br>irritably.<br><br>Droma laughed. &#x201c;Anyway, it&#x2019;s not the age of the ship<br>that worries me,&#x201d; he said, flicking a couple of switches of<br>his own. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the age of the pilot I&#x2019;m more concerned<br>about.&#x201d;<br><br>The navicomputer bleeped, cutting off any retort Han<br>might have been about to offer. Both faced the front just<br>as the sweeping streaks of hyperspace dissolved into a<br>cold and distant starscape. There was no primary to dim<br>the stars with its glare; the nearest inhabited system in<br>this section of the Mid Rim was more than ten light years<br>away, and the nearest star of any kind was half that<br>distance. There was nothing for trillions of kilometers<br>but space dust, and the tiny bauble that was the lonely<br>world of Esfandia.<br><br>Or so it <i>should </i>have been. As <i>Pride of Selonia </i>along<br>with Twin Suns Squadron emerged from hyperspace alongside<br>the <i>Falcon</i>, Droma&#x2019;s eyes checked the sensor console<br>for the orphaned planet. The <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s sensor suite was<br>still ahead of standard tech, and it soon acquired the target.<br>It was covered with thick clouds, and glowed a burnt<br>orange in artificial colors that looked wrong to Leia&#x2019;s<br>eyes until she realized what was missing: because Esfandia<br>had no sun, its sole source of heat lay at its core. And<br>with no orbit to follow, that meant it would have no seasons,<br>either&#x2014;which in turn meant no icy poles, and no<br>broiling equator. It would be the same temperature all<br>over.<br><br>Closer scans, however, revealed that not to be entirely<br>the case. There were at least six hot spots on the hemisphere<br>facing them, and even as they watched, another<br>blossomed into life.<br><br>Droma zoomed in closer to examine the cause.<br><br>&#x201c;Aerial bombardment,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s dropping<br>mines from orbit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re taking out the sensors,&#x201d; Leia said. &#x201c;The Yuuzhan<br>Vong are still here!&#x201d;<br><br>Han&#x2019;s eyes darted across the displays in front of him.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a strong presence in close orbit. Seven capital<br>vessels, nine cruisers. Not many skips detached, though.<br>No sign of the local defenses, or the reinforcements from<br>Mon Cal.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think I can guess why not, too,&#x201d; Droma commented.<br><br>Leia knew exactly what he meant. The Yuuzhan Vong<br>force in orbit over Esfandia was enormous by any standard.<br>Against the two squadrons and one frigate Esfandia<br>had possessed, plus the two squadrons Mon Calamari<br>had dispatched to investigate, it was almost obscene.<br><i>Overkill </i>didn&#x2019;t cover it.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought the Vong&#x2019;s resources were stretched,&#x201d; Droma<br>said.<br><br>Han just grunted. A crackle of information flowed<br>across newly reopened communications lines. Captain<br>Mayn and Jag were looking for instructions.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell them to hold off for a moment,&#x201d; Leia ordered.<br><br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t go in like this. It&#x2019;d be suicide.&#x201d;<br><br>Han turned in his seat to face her. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t just leave,<br>Leia.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded in agreement. &#x201c;The relay base must still be<br>down there, otherwise the Yuuzhan Vong wouldn&#x2019;t be<br>wasting time taking out the sensors. Without the base,<br>none of it would work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So what are we going to do?&#x201d; Han asked. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re<br>going to see us any second.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia stood to look over Han&#x2019;s shoulder, placing a hand<br>gently on his neck. The Yuuzhan Vong forces were formidable.<br>&#x201c;If we can get past the capital ships, we might<br>be able to make it down into the atmosphere and find the<br>base before they do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then what?&#x201d; Droma asked. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d be in exactly the<br>same position as the base. It would just be a matter of<br>time before they find us.&#x201d;<br><br>She could feel her frustration mounting as a solution<br>to the dilemma failed to present itself. If they had to<br>abandon Esfandia, they might still be able to jury-rig another<br>relay base elsewhere that would allow them to<br>reestablish contact with Mon Calamari.<br><br>She shook her head irritably. It would still mean leaving<br>innocents here on Esfandia to die, and the thought of<br>that simply made her feel ill, reminding her as it did of<br>the time back on Gyndine, where so many had to be<br>abandoned to a cruel fate.<br><br><i>There has to be another way, </i>she thought.<br><br>Almost in answer to the thought, a bleeping sounded<br>from the sensor suite, announcing hyperspace emissions<br>from the far side of the planet.<br><br>&#x201c;Incoming,&#x201d; Droma announced, his tail wrapped<br>around the base of his chair, gently twitching.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all we need,&#x201d; Han muttered. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s time<br>we bid a hasty retreat, after all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d; Leia switched vantage points to look over<br>Droma&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re Yuuzhan Vong.<br>Broadcast an emergency on the Imperial codes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Imperial&#x2014;?&#x201d; Han started, but clammed up at a glance<br>at the scanner display. The corner of his mouth curled up<br>into a grin as he sent off the coded transmission. &#x201c;Well, I<br>never thought I&#x2019;d be glad to see a Star Destroyer.&#x201d;<br>Not just one of them, Leia noted. Two of the massive<br>vessels were lumbering out of hyperspace over Esfandia,<br>fully equipped with support vessels and TIE fighters<br>already streaming from launching bays. The way they<br>swooped in to engage the Yuuzhan Vong filled her with<br>an immediate sense of optimism and kinship.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t immediately recognize the markings on the<br>Star Destroyers, but judging by the blast scoring and<br>other minor damage, it looked like they&#x2019;d both recently<br>seen combat.<br><br>The <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s comm bleeped, and Han quickly answered<br>it. It was Grand Admiral Pellaeon.<br><br>&#x201c;I should have known I&#x2019;d find the <i>Millennium Falcon<br></i>here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always at the heart of trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia felt a smile creep across her face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to<br>hear from you, Gilad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As it is you, Princess,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not <i>Chimaera </i>you&#x2019;re flying,&#x201d; Han put in. &#x201c;It<br>looks too old.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>Right to Rule</i>,&#x201d; Pellaeon said. &#x201c;One of the oldest<br>in the fleet. We&#x2019;ve been chasing this sorry bunch halfway<br>across the galaxy, trying to restrict the amount of damage<br>they inflict. We lost them at the last jump, which is<br>why we&#x2019;ve only just arrived. Our intelligence data on your<br>remote stations is sadly out of date.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not as good as theirs, obviously,&#x201d; Leia said.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re here to try to turn our luck around now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to hear it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you joining us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re at your command, Admiral.&#x201d; Leia said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have targets for you shortly. Commander Ansween<br>will relay them to you.&#x201d; Then, almost as an afterthought,<br>the Grand Admiral added: &#x201c;Nice to be fighting<br>beside you finally, Captain Solo.&#x201d;<br><br>Han looked up at Leia when the line closed a moment<br>later. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re taking orders from an Imperial now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Things have changed,&#x201d; she said. Her heart was telling<br>her that Pellaeon could be trusted, and the Force was<br>telling her the same thing. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s defending a Galactic Alliance<br>asset. Think how strange that must feel to <i>him</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>Han chuckled ruefully. &#x201c;I guess. It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;ve never<br>been one for taking orders&#x2014;from <i>anyone</i>. I hope this<br>newfound camaraderie between us isn&#x2019;t going to make<br>him think that&#x2019;s about to change.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia smiled at her husband; one hand fondly massaged<br>his neck. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Pellaeon&#x2019;s fully aware of that, Han.&#x201d;<br><br>The comm unit crackled back to life, this time with a<br>female voice&#x2014;obviously the commander whom the Grand<br>Admiral had mentioned.<br><br>&#x201c;Your primary target is the destroyer <i>Kur-hashan</i>,&#x201d;<br>she said. A flood of charts and other data accompanied<br>the message on the <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s monitors. &#x201c;This is a yammoskbearing<br>vessel. Secondary targets are support vessels. Engage<br>at will. <i>Right to Rule </i>out.&#x201d;<br><br>Han punched a course into the navicomputer. &#x201c;You<br>got that, <i>Selonia</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Loud and clear,&#x201d; came back the voice of Captain<br>Mayn.<br><br>&#x201c;Jag?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twin Suns awaits your orders, Captain,&#x201d; Jag said.<br>He sounded calm and controlled, but underneath the<br>cool exterior Leia knew he was primed and ready for<br>combat.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we about to do what I think we&#x2019;re about to do?&#x201d;<br>Droma asked, somewhat nervously.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one always second-guessing everyone,&#x201d;<br>Han replied. &#x201c;You tell us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t take much foresight to know we&#x2019;re still<br>outnumbered. While it&#x2019;s nice that we have company and<br>all, it still only makes two Star Destroyers against sixteen<br>of the big uglies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Han said, a wide, familiar grin settling onto<br>his face. &#x201c;It makes it so much more interesting when the<br>odds are stacked against you, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;</p><h2>If Aristotle Ran General Motors</h2><p>Since its hardcover publication in 1997, If Aristotle Ran General Motors has been one of the year's most talked about books, not only in the United States but around the world, where it has been translated into many languages.

And Morris isn&#39;t dumbing down his message for the corporate culture. Rather, he&#39;s genuinely interested in fostering a workplace environment where one can seriously think about truth, beauty, goodness, and unity. &#34;If we let the great philosophers guide our thinking,&#34; he says, &#34;and if we then begin to become philosophers ourselves, we put ourselves in the very best position to move towards genuine excellence, true prosperity, and deeply satisfying success in our businesses, our families, and our lives.

Her measured verses have stirred our souls, energized our minds, and healed our hearts. Whether offering hope in the darkest of nights or expressing sincere joy at the extraordinariness of the everyday, Maya Angelou has served as our common voice. <br><br><i>Celebrations </i>is a collection of timely and timeless poems that are an integral part of the global fabric. Several works have become nearly as iconic as Angelou herself: the inspiring &#x201c;On the Pulse of Morning,&#x201d; read at President William Jefferson Clinton&#x2019;s 1993 inauguration; the heartening &#x201c;Amazing Peace,&#x201d; presented at the 2005 lighting of the National Christmas Tree at the White House; &#x201c;A Brave and Startling Truth,&#x201d; which marked the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations; and &#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; which beautifully honors the first woman in our lives. Angelou writes of celebrations public and private, a bar mitzvah wish to her nephew, a birthday greeting to Oprah Winfrey, and a memorial tribute to the late Luther Vandross and Barry White.<br><br>More than a writer, Angelou is a chronicler of history, an advocate for peace, and a champion for the planet, as well as a patriot, a mentor, and a friend. To be shared and cherished, the wisdom and poetry of Maya Angelou proves there is always cause for celebration.</p><p><b>Maya Angelou</b> was raised in Stamps, Arkansas.

In the mid-1970s, I was a correspondent for <i>Time</i> magazine in Paris. It was a small office, so I got to write stories on subjects as varied as French politics and <i>haute couture</i>. When a big story broke in one of the countries under the Paris bureau, I jetted off to Madrid to cover the assassination of a Spanish prime minister, to Lisbon to report on a revolution taking place, or to Amsterdam to check into a bribery scandal involving the Dutch queen's husband. </p><p> On May 24, 1976, I happened to be in Paris. The previous week I had suggested to editors in New York a story on a wine tasting that was doing the unthinkable: comparing some of the greatest names in French wines with new and little-known California wines. It seemed like a nonevent -- clearly France would win -- but as a native Californian, I had developed an interest in wine and had tried to learn something about European wines while studying or working in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, and, of course, France. </p><p> Each week <i>Time</i> correspondents around the world suggest hundreds of stories. Only a few of the proposals are scheduled and even fewer ever make it to press. It's a fierce survival-of-the-fittest process, but the result is a lively, compelling publication. Although my story was scheduled, I knew that the odds of it getting into the magazine were long. If, as expected, the French wines won, there would be no story. But you never know, and a wine tasting -- where maybe I'd get a chance to try a few of the wines myself -- seemed, at the very least, like a perfectly wonderful way to spend an otherwise slow afternoon. </p><p> The event was taking place at the InterContinental Hotel, not far from the <i>Time</i> office just off the Champs-�lys�es. In winter I might have taken the M�tro there, but it was a beautiful spring day, so instead I walked through the immaculate gardens lining the grand boulevard toward the Place de la Concorde. I considered this the most beautiful part of the world's most beautiful city. There were monumental buildings, elegant people, and an exciting hustle and bustle. This was the epicenter of the city Gershwin put to music in <i>An American in Paris</i>. I strolled past the American embassy and the Egyptian obelisk nicknamed Cleopatra's Needle in the Place de La Concorde to the Rue de Rivoli, and then under its arcades lined with fashionable shops displaying their wares. The InterContinental, located on the Rue de Castiglione and bordered by the Rue de Rivoli and the majestic Place Vend�me, was one of the most fashionable hotels in Paris. It reeked of class and luxury. </p><p> A hotel doorman directed me to the small, elegant room off the hotel's patio bar where the tasting was to take place. As I entered, waiters in tuxedos were busily setting up the event, laying out tablecloths and distributing glasses. I knew the organizers of the tasting, Englishman Steven Spurrier, who owned a nearby wine shop called the Caves de la Madeleine, and his sidekick Patricia Gallagher, an American. I had taken an introductory wine course taught by Gallagher at the Acad�mie du Vin, a wine school associated with the shop. Her personal plea was one of the reasons I had agreed to cover the tasting, which was designed to garner some publicity for the shop and school, but they were having a hard time getting any publications to take it seriously. In fact, I was the only journalist who showed up. After saying hello to Gallagher, I started taking notes in the brown plastic-covered book that I always carried with me. </p><p> Soon the nine judges began arriving. I knew none of them personally, but they had impeccable credentials and were among the leading wine experts in France. With the quiet formalism of the French establishment, the judges greeted each other with a handshake and then took their places along the long bank of tables. As this was going to be a blind tasting, meaning the labels of the wines would not be shown, the judges would not know which wines they were tasting. They knew only that the wines were from France and California, and that the red wines were Bordeaux-style Cabernet Sauvignons and the whites were Burgundy-style Chardonnays. Shortly after 3:00 PM, a waiter began walking up and down a row of tables pouring wine from unmarked bottles. The judges had nothing in front of them except a scorecard, two glasses, and a <i>petit pain</i>, a small hard roll for nibbling on to clean the palate between wines. As is common in a wine tasting, the judges started with the white wines. </p><p> It was a very informal event, so I was free to roam around the room as the judges tasted the wines. They were a little chattier than is normal at a tasting, where the experts usually quietly concentrate on the work at hand. </p><p> About halfway through the white wine part of the competition, I began to notice something quite shocking. I had a list of the wines and realized that the judges were getting confused! They were identifying a French wine as a California one and vice versa. Judges at one end of the tables were insisting that a particular wine was French, while those at the other were saying it was from California. </p><p> Raymond Oliver, the owner and chef of the Grand V�four restaurant in Paris, one of the temples of French <i>haute cuisine</i>, swirled a white wine in his glass, held it up to the light to examine the pale straw color, smelled it, and then tasted it. After a pause he said, "Ah, back to France!" I checked my list of wines twice to be sure, but Oliver had in fact just tasted a 1972 Freemark Abbey Chardonnay from California's Napa Valley! Soon after, Claude Dubois-Millot of GaultMillau, a publisher of French food and wine books and magazines, tasted another white wine and said with great confidence, "That is definitely California. It has no nose." But the wine was really a 1973 B�tard-Montrachet Ramonet-Prudhon, one of Burgundy's finest products. </p><p> Spurrier's Paris tasting might just be an interesting story after all. </p><p> </p><p> Text copyright � 2005 by George M. Taber </p><p><b>Chapter One: The Little Wine Shop in Cit� Berryer</b> </p><p> </p><blockquote><i>If we sip the wine, we find dreams </i><p><i> coming upon us out of the imminent night.</i> </p><p> -- D. H. Lawrence</p></blockquote> <p> On an autumn day in 1970, two Englishmen were walking around Paris's posh Right Bank near the Rue Royale. Although its glory was in the nineteenth century, luxury still reigns there as an art form in this section made up of the city's First and Eighth <i>arrondissements</i>. The area combines New York City's Park Avenue with Beverly Hills's Rodeo Drive. Within a few blocks are found such restaurants as Maxim's, shops like Herm�s and Cartier, and the Ritz, the quintessential ritzy hotel. The Right Bank is a wonderful area for strolling, especially in the fall after most of the tourists have left and the city's pace slows a little. The summer heat is gone, and the chestnut leaves begin to fall. </p><p> The two men wandered into Cit� Berryer, a street easy to miss because it was only a block long, going from the Rue Royale to the Boissy d'Anglas. Cit� Berryer was a slightly seedy shopping arcade that seemed out of place amid all the luxury around it. Built in the nineteenth century, it was named after a then leading, but now long forgotten, politician. Twice a week an open-air, fresh vegetable and fruit market took place there, and fashionable and unfashionable women alike lined up to buy produce for their families. A small wine shop was located next to a locksmith. </p><p> As the two men passed the Caves de la Madeleine, a wine shop named after the famous church located two blocks away, one man turned to the other and said, "That is exactly the kind of shop I would like to buy." </p><p> Steven Spurrier was a well-to-do son of English landed gentry, who at the age of twenty-nine was still trying to figure out what he was going to do when he grew up. After spending several months living in Provence in southern France, Spurrier had recently moved to Paris, where he and his wife, Bella, resided on a 130-foot barge moored on the River Seine at the Place de la Concorde. </p><p> If there was a centerpiece to Spurrier's wandering life, it was wine. In his youth, when other boys were outside playing soccer, he could be found rearranging bottles in the wine cellar at Holbrook Hall, his family's estate in Derbyshire in north-central England. Spurrier worked for a short time for two leading shops in the London wine trade. One of them sent him -- at his own expense -- on a seven-month study tour of wine through France, Germany, Spain, and Portugal. </p><p> As Spurrier and his friend, a British lawyer living in Paris, entered the store, the owner, Madame Foug�res, asked if she could help them. </p><p> "My friend here would like to buy your shop," said the lawyer with British directness. </p><p> The idea was not so crazy. The wine shop had actually been quietly for sale for two years, after the owner's husband had committed suicide. His widow had lost interest in running the business, which involved lots of heavy work lifting cases and pushing around barrels of wine. After a few minutes of conversation, the two Englishmen left. </p><p> A few days later, Spurrier returned alone to talk to Madame Foug�res about buying the shop. She explained that she had a strong emotional tie to the store because it had been her husband's pride -- in fact, his whole life. She was not certain if she would sell it, especially to an Englishman who didn't speak much French, despite his proclaimed interest in her country's most prestigious product. Madame Foug�res told Spurrier she doubted he could "carry the torch" for her dead husband. Spurrier then made a proposal. To show he was serious, he would work for her in the store for six months at no pay, doing whatever she asked. It was a deal she could hardly refuse. </p><p> So even though he had $250,000 in inheritance money in the bank, Spurrier went to work rolling wine barrels around the store's cellar and delivering cases of wine up s...</p></p><h2>Queen of the Falls</h2><p>Annie Taylor, a short, plump and fussy sixty-two year old widow, runs a charm school, right by Niagara Falls.

My family was making a winter trip from the Midwest to New England. We arrived in Niagara close to sunset, with plans to spend the night. I don&#x2019;t remember if it was my sister&#x2019;s and my demand that required we see the falls right away, but that is what happened.</p> <p> Over the years, I have had opportunities to visit sites renowned for their beauty and awe-inspiring nature and have occasionally been disappointed, but the falls exceeded my expectations. They were far more majestic and awesome than my twelve-year-old mind had been able to imagine.</p> <p> I viewed the waterfall initially from a park. It was close enough to the mist rising from the falling water and drifting across the park that the trees within it had&#x2014;because of the cold winter air&#x2014;become encased in ice. The sun was low in the sky and the light that penetrated the mist glistened off the trees, creating an effect that made it seem as if the world was made of glass. In the background, the constant roar of the falls seemed to insist on my attention, no matter how magical the surrounding landscape.</p> <p> This mist made a strong impression and left me with the peculiar memory of a place that was both enchanting and frightening.</p> <p> Many years passed, and sometime in the early 1970s I happened upon a magazine article called "The Daredevils of Niagara Falls." I discovered that over the previous century, the Falls had attracted a world-class group of eccentric risk takers. Among the most remarkable of these was the first person to go over the falls in a barrel. I was amazed to learn that this individual was a sixty-two-year-old retired charm school teacher named Annie Edson Taylor. Just as amazing to me was that I&#x2019;d gotten to the age of twenty-two and had never heard of this woman and what she had done. </p> <p> Why, I wondered, hadn&#x2019;t I learned about this in school? I wouldn&#x2019;t compare it to Lindberg crossing the Atlantic, but still, it seemed extraordinary in its own way, and yet had evidently been left to history.</p> <p> About a year and a half ago, in the spirit of finding new challenges, I decided to undertake a project that was a change from the fantasies that make up a large part of my work. Recalling the pleasure I got as a child from reading biographies of unusual or accomplished Americans, and how satisfying it was to learn about American history and culture that way, I decided to write just such a biography. I couldn&#x2019;t decide who might make a worthy subject and who had not already been the subject of other books. There, from the recesses of memory, sprang the name Annie Taylor.</p> <p> Researching Mrs. Taylor&#x2019;s life provided details that made it clear that her story was not one that fit into a conventional narrative of the determined underdog who triumphs over the challenges and obstacles placed before him or her, and emerges with admiration and rich rewards. Annie&#x2019;s story was more complicated than that&#x2014;and, to me, more interesting.</p> <p> My initial design for the book was horizontal, partly to accommodate longer text in a thirty-two-page format. I ultimately changed to a vertical shape when it became clear a forty-page format would allow for a more effective balance of text and pictures. (I was also persuaded by my colleagues at the publisher that a vertical format was more appropriate for a book about a monumental fall.) </p> <p> I have included here two sketches for jacket designs I made when still thinking about a horizontal book, as well as an example of what a very early and rough draft looks like as I attempt to work out the text placement and picture sequence. </p> <p> I hope you enjoy reading about the amazing adventures of Annie Edson Taylor.</p> <p> Yours truly,</p> <p>Chris Van Allsburg </p> <b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b> <p></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <br> </td> <td> <br> <br> </td> <td> <br> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br><p><b>Chris Van Allsburg </b>is the winner of two Caldecott Medals, for <i>Jumanji </i>and <i>The Polar Express</i>, as well as the recipient of a Caldecott Honor Book for <i>The Garden of Abdul Gasazi</i>.

Featuring a pitch-perfect screenplay, a classic soundtrack, and unforgettable performances by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and a deep supporting cast, Casablanca was hailed in the <em>New York Times</em> as &#x201c;a picture that makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap.&#x201d; The film won Oscars for best picture, best director, and best screenplay, and would go on to enjoy more revival screenings than any other movie in history. It became so firmly ensconced in the cultural imagination that, as Umberto Eco once said, <em>Casablanca</em> is &#x201c;not <em>one</em> movie; it is &#x2018;movies.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p><em>We&#x2019;ll Always Have Casablanca</em> is celebrated film historian Noah Isenberg&#x2019;s rich account of this most beloved movie&#x2019;s origins. Through extensive research and interviews with filmmakers, film critics, family members of the cast and crew, and diehard fans, Isenberg reveals the myths and realities behind <em>Casablanca</em>&#x2019;s production, exploring the transformation of the unproduced stage play into the classic screenplay, the controversial casting decisions, the battles with Production Code censors, and the effect of the war&#x2019;s progress on the movie&#x2019;s reception. Isenberg particularly focuses on the central role refugees from Hitler&#x2019;s Europe played in the production (nearly all of the actors and actresses cast in <em>Casablanca</em> were immigrants).</p><p>Finally, Isenberg turns to <em>Casablanca</em>&#x2019;s long afterlife and the reasons it remains so revered. From the Marx Brothers&#x2019; 1946 spoof hit, <em>A Night in Casablanca</em>, to loving parodies in <em>New Yorker</em> cartoons, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> skits, and <em>Simpsons</em> episodes, Isenberg delves into the ways the movie has lodged itself in the American psyche.</p><p>Filled with fresh insights into <em>Casablanca</em>&#x2019;s creation, production, and legacy, <em>We&#x2019;ll Always Have Casablanca</em> is a magnificent account of what made the movie so popular and why it continues to dazzle audiences seventy-five years after its release.</p> 24 illustrations</p><p>Noah Isenberg is professor and chair of the department of radio-television-film at the University of Texas at Austin, the author of We&#39;ll Always Have Casablanca, Edgar G.

It asks what follows when we make our desires and even our own happiness conditional on the happiness of others: &#x201c;I just want you to be happy&#x201d;; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy if you&#x2019;re happy.&#x201d; Combining philosophy and feminist cultural studies, Sara Ahmed reveals the affective and moral work performed by the &#x201c;happiness duty,&#x201d; the expectation that we will be made happy by taking part in that which is deemed good, and that by being happy ourselves, we will make others happy. Ahmed maintains that happiness is a promise that directs us toward certain life choices and away from others. Happiness is promised to those willing to live their lives in the right way. <p></p><p>Ahmed draws on the intellectual history of happiness, from classical accounts of ethics as the good life, through seventeenth-century writings on affect and the passions, eighteenth-century debates on virtue and education, and nineteenth-century utilitarianism. She engages with feminist, antiracist, and queer critics who have shown how happiness is used to justify social oppression, and how challenging oppression causes unhappiness. Reading novels and films including<i> Mrs. Dalloway</i>, <i>The Well of Loneliness</i>, <i>Bend It Like Beckham</i>, and <i>Children of Men</i>, Ahmed considers the plight of the figures who challenge and are challenged by the attribution of happiness to particular objects or social ideals: the feminist killjoy, the unhappy queer, the angry black woman, and the melancholic migrant. Through her readings she raises critical questions about the moral order imposed by the injunction to be happy.</p></p><p>&#34;At a time when happiness studies are all the rage and feminism is accused of destroying women&#39;s happiness, Sara Ahmed offers a bold critique of the consensus that happiness is an unconditional good. Her new book asks searching questions about the nature of the good life, making its case in a wonderfully pellucid prose. What a paradox that a defense of the kill-joy should be such a pleasure to read! This timely, original, and intellectually expansive book is sure to trigger a great deal of debate.&#34;--Rita Felski, University of Virginia<p>Sara Ahmed is Professor of Race and Cultural Studies at Goldsmiths College, University of London.

Yet too often, says Scot McKnight, Christians have held to the supremacy of one metaphor over against the others, to their detriment. He argues instead that to plumb the rich theological depths of the atonement, we must consider all the metaphors of atonement and ask whether they each serve a larger purpose.<br><br><em>A Community Called Atonement </em>is a constructive theology that not only values the church's atonement metaphors but also asserts that the atonement fundamentally shapes the life of the Christian and of the church. That is, Christ identifies with humans to call us into a community that reflects God's love (the church)--but that community then has the responsibility to offer God's love to others through missional practices of justice and fellowship, living out its life together as the story of God's reconciliation. Scot McKnight thus offers an accessible, thought-provoking theology of atonement that engages the concerns of those in the emerging church conversation and will be of interest to all those in the church and academy who are listening in.</p><p><strong>Scot McKnight </strong>is Karl A. Olsson Professor in Religious Studies at North Park University in Chicago."McKnight isn't advocating a mushy `let's all get along' evasion of the issues, which are many and important. But he is seeking to practice what we preach whenever we preach atonement: that God calls us to reconcile with God, ourselves, one another, and all creation. That means that the way we treat one another when we disagree about atonement can't be separated from what we preach when we preach atonement. Theory and praxis are profoundly inseparable. At this critical time in history, I believe we need, not atonement wars (or other kinds of theo-combat), but rather mature and generative conversation on atonement, so we can together go back to the Scriptures and in their light savor the rich meaning of Christ's saving work. A Community Called Atonement joins books by Willard, Boersma, Green, Baker, and others as an excellent and accessible resource for this conversation, informed by both current and historical scholarship." -- <i> ----Brian McLaren (brianmclaren.net) is an author, speaker, and former pastor active in the emergent conversation. His next book, Everything Must Change: Jesus, Global Crises, and a Revolution of Hope, will be released October 2. </i><br><br>"Atonement theology, McKnight rightly insists, cannot operate with only one theory; it needs all of the biblical metaphors and each of the traditional atonement models. They all come together, he points out, in the patristic model of recapitulation--or, as he calls it, identification for incorporation. More than just being gutsy, orthodox, creative, as well as scholarly in character, this book actually atones; it models what it sets out to demonstrate, namely, that the church is summoned to work with God in his atoning work." -- <i>Hans Boersma, J. I. Packer Professor of Historical and Systematic Theology, Regent College</i><br><br>"Few ideas are more central to Christian faith than the doctrine of atonement. And yet for too many atonement is merely that: a doctrine. In A Community Called Atonement, Scot McKnight takes the reader on a compelling, thorough, and creative exploration of the work of Christ and breathes into this doctrine a biblically robust understanding of God's intent for creation in Christ." -- <i>Tim Keel, pastor of Jacob's Well Church and author of Intuitive Leadership: Embracing a Paradigm of Narrative, Metaphor, and Chaos</i><br><br>"It takes a village--or rather, an evangelical catholic community--to communicate everything McKnight wants to say about atonement. Sure both to stimulate imaginations and to raise hackles as it remixes biblical metaphors, integrates doctrine and praxis, and deconstructs one-sided theories of the saving significance of the cross, A Community Called Atonement may well turn out to be a theological manifesto called 'emergent.'" -- <i>Kevin J. Vanhoozer, Research Professor of Systematic Theology, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</i></p><h2>Dexter in the Dark</h2><p>In his work as a Miami crime scene investigator, Dexter Morgan is accustomed to seeing evil deeds. . . particularly because, on occasion, he commits them himself. But Dexter's happy existence is turned upside down when he is called to an unusually disturbing crime scene at the university campus. Dexter's Dark Passenger &#x2013; mastermind of his homicidal prowess &#x2013; immediately senses something chillingly recognizable and goes into hiding. Dexter is alone for the first time in his life, and he realizes he's being hunted by a truly sinister adversary. Meanwhile he's planning a wedding and trying to learn how to be a stepfather to his fianc�'s two kids &#x2013; who might just have dark tendencies themselves. Macabre, ironic, and wonderfully entertaining, <i>Dexter in the Dark</i> goes deeper into the psyche of one of the freshest protagonists in recent fiction.</p><p>JEFF LINDSAY is the author of <i>Darkly Dreaming Dexter</i> and <i>Dearly Devoted Dexter</i>.

Oh, it pulls and whines and shines in a cheap and guttering imitation of what it should do, but there is no edge to it. This moon has no wind in it to sail carnivores across the happy night sky and into slash&#x2013;and&#x2013;slice ecstasy. Instead this moon flickers shyly through a squeaky&#x2013;clean window, onto a woman who perches all cheerful and perky on the edge of the couch and talks about flowers, canapes, and Paris.<br><br>Paris?<br><br>Yes, with moon&#x2013;faced seriousness, Paris is what she is talking about in that far&#x2013;spreading syrupy tone. She is talking about Paris. Again.<br><br>So what kind of moon can this possibly be, with its near&#x2013;breathless smile and smirking lace around the edges? It batters feebly at the window, but it can&#x2019;t quite get in past all the sickly&#x2013;sweet warbling. And what kind of Dark Avenger could simply sit across the room, as poor Dazed Dexter does now, pretending to listen while mooning blearily on his chair?<br><br>Why, this moon must be a honeymoon&#x2014;unfurling its marital banner across the living&#x2013;room night, signaling for all to rally round, sound the charge, once more into the church, dear friends&#x2014;because Dexter of the Deadly Dimples is getting married. Hitched to the wagon of bliss pulled by the lovely Rita, who has turned out to have a lifelong passion to see Paris.<br><br>Married, honeymoon in Paris...Do these words really belong in the same sentence as any reference at all to our Phantom Flenser?<br><br>Can we really see a suddenly sober and simpering slasher at the altar of an actual church, in Fred Astaire tie and tails, slipping the ring onto a white&#x2013;wrapped finger while the congregation sniffles and beams? And then Demon Dexter in madras shorts, gawking at the Eiffel Tower and snarfing cafe au lait at the Arc de Triomphe? Holding hands and trundling giddily along the Seine, staring vacantly at every gaudy trinket in the Louvre?<br><br>Of course, I suppose I could make a pilgrimage to the Rue Morgue, a sacred site for serial slashers.<br><br>But let us be just a tiny bit serious for a moment: Dexter in Paris? For starters, are Americans still allowed to go to France? And for finishers, Dexter in Paris? On a <i>honeymoon</i>? How can someone of Dexter&#x2019;s midnight persuasions possibly consider anything so ordinary? How can someone who considers sex as interesting as deficit accounting enter into marriage? In short, how by all that is unholy, dark, and deadly can Dexter really mean to do this?<br><br>All wonderful questions, and very reasonable. And in truth, somewhat difficult to answer, even to myself. But here I am, enduring the Chinese water torture of Rita&#x2019;s expectations and wondering how Dexter can possibly go through with this.<br><br>Well then. Dexter can go through with this because he must, in part to maintain and even upgrade his necessary disguise, which prevents the world at large from seeing him for what he is, which is at best not something one would really like to have sitting across the table when the lights go out&#x2014;especially if there is silverware present. And quite naturally, it takes a great deal of careful work to make sure it is not generally known that Dexter is driven by his Dark Passenger, a whispery&#x2013;silk voice in the shaded backseat that from time to time climbs into the front seat to take the wheel and drive us to the Theme Park of the Unthinkable. It would never do to have the sheep see that Dexter is the wolf among them.<br><br>And so work we do, the Passenger and I, work very hard at our disguise. For the past several years we have had Dating Dexter, designed to present a cheerful and above all normal face to the world. This charming production featured Rita as the Girlfriend, and it was in many ways an ideal arrangement, since she was as uninterested in sex as I am, and yet wanted the companionship of an Understanding Gentleman. And Dexter really does understand. Not humans, romance, love, and all that gabble. No. What Dexter understands is the lethally grinning bottom line, how to find the utterly deserving among Miami&#x2019;s oh&#x2013;so&#x2013;many candidates for that final dark election to Dexter&#x2019;s modest Hall of Fame.<br><br>This does not absolutely guarantee that Dexter is a charming companion; the charm took years of practice, and it is the pure artificial product of great laboratory skill. But alas for poor Rita&#x2014;battered by a terribly unfortunate and violent first marriage&#x2014;she can&#x2019;t seem to tell the margarine from the butter.<br><br>All well and good. For two years Dexter and Rita cut a brilliant swathe across the Miami social scene, noticed and admired everywhere. But then, through a series of events that might well leave an enlightened observer somewhat skeptical, Dexter and Rita had become accidentally engaged. And the more I pondered on how to extricate myself from this ridiculous fate, the more I realized that it was a logical next step in the evolution of my disguise. A married Dexter&#x2014;a Dexter with two ready&#x2013;made children!&#x2014;is surely a great deal further from seeming to be anything at all like what he really is. A quantum leap forward, onto a new level of human camouflage.<br><br>And then there are the two children.<br><br>It may seem strange that someone whose only passion is for human vivisection should actually enjoy Rita&#x2019;s children, but he does. I do. Mind you, I don&#x2019;t get all weepy&#x2013;eyed at the thought of a lost tooth, since that would require the ability to feel emotion, and I am quite happily without any such mutation. But on the whole, I find children a great deal more interesting than their elders, and I get particularly irritable with those who cause them harm. In fact, I occasionally search them out. And when I track these predators down, and when I am very sure that they have actually done what they have been doing, I make sure they are quite unable to do it ever again&#x2014;and with a very happy hand, unspoiled by conscience.<br><br>So the fact that Rita had two children from her disastrous first marriage was far from repellent, particularly when it became apparent that they needed Dexter&#x2019;s special parenting touch to keep their own fledgling Dark Passengers strapped into a safe, snug Dark Car Seat until they could learn how to drive for themselves. For presumably as a result of the emotional and even physical damage inflicted on Cody and Astor by their drug&#x2013;addled biological father, they too had turned to the Dark Side, just like me. And now they were to be my children, legally as well as spiritually. It was almost enough to make me feel that there was some guiding purpose to life after all.<br><br>And so there were several very good reasons for Dexter to go through with this&#x2014;but Paris? I don&#x2019;t know where it came from, this idea that Paris is romantic. Aside from the French, has anyone but Lawrence Welk ever thought an accordion was sexy? And wasn&#x2019;t it by now clear that they don&#x2019;t like us there? And they insist on speaking French, of all things?<br><br>Perhaps Rita had been brainwashed by an old movie, something with a perky&#x2013;plucky blonde and a romantic dark-haired man, modernist music playing as they pursue each other around the Eiffel Tower and laugh at the quaint hostility of the dirty, Gauloise&#x2013;smoking man in the beret. Or maybe she had heard a Jacques Brel record once and decided it spoke to her soul. Who can say? But somehow Rita had the notion firmly welded into her steel&#x2013;trap brain that Paris was the capital of sophisticated romance, and the idea would not come out without major surgery.<br><br>So on top of the endless debates about chicken versus fish and wine versus cash bar, a series of monomaniacal rambling monologues about Paris began to emerge. Surely we could afford a whole week, that would give us time to see the Jardin des Tuileries and the Louvre&#x2014;and maybe something by Moliere at the Comedie&#x2013;Francaise. I had to applaud the depth of her research. For my part, my interest in Paris had faded away completely long ago when I learned that it was in France.<br><br>Luckily for us, I was saved from the necessity of finding a politic way of telling her all this when Cody and Astor made their subtle entrance. They don&#x2019;t barrel into a room with guns blazing as most children of seven and ten do. As I have said, they were somewhat damaged by their dear old biological dad, and one consequence is that you never see them come and go: they enter the room by osmosis. One moment they are nowhere to be seen and the next they are standing quietly beside you, waiting to be noticed.<br><br>&#x201c;We want to play kick the can,&#x201d; Astor said. She was the spokesperson for the pair; Cody never put more than four words together in a single day. He was not stupid, very far from it. He simply preferred not to speak most of the time. Now he just looked at me and nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Rita, pausing in her reflections on the land of Rousseau, Candide, and Jerry Lewis, &#x201c;well then, why don&#x2019;t you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We want to play kick the can with Dexter,&#x201d; Astor added, and Cody nodded very loudly.<br><br>Rita frowned. &#x201c;I guess we should have talked about this before, but don&#x2019;t you think Cody and Astor&#x2014;I mean, shouldn&#x2019;t they start to call you something more, I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;but just Dexter? It seems kind of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about<i> mon papere</i>?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Or <i>Monsieur le Comte</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about, I don&#x2019;t think so?&#x201d; muttered Astor.<br><br>&#x201c;I just think&#x2014;&#x201d; said Rita.<br><br>&#x201c;Dexter is fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re used to it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t seem respectful,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>I looked down at Astor. &#x201c;Show your mother you can say &#x2018;Dexter&#x2019; respectfully,&#x201d; I told her.<br><br>She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Puh-<i>leeeeeze</i>,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>I smiled at Rita. &#x201c;See? She&#x2019;s ten years old. She can&#x2019;t say <i>anything</i> respectfully.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yes, but,&#x201d; Rita said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. They&#x2019;re okay," I said. &#x201c;But Paris&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go outside,&#x201d; said Cody, and I looked at him with surprise. Four entire syllables&#x2014;for him it was practically an oration.<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Rita. &#x201c;If you really think&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I almost never think,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It gets in the way of the mental process.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t make any sense,&#x201d; Astor said.<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t have to make sense. It&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>Cody shook his head. &#x201c;Kick the can,&#x201d; he said. And rather than break in on his talking jag, I simply followed him out into the yard.<br><b>Chapter Two</b><br>Of course, even with Rita&#x2019;s glorious plans unfolding, life was not all jubilation and strawberries. There was real work to do, too. And because Dexter is nothing if not conscientious, I had been doing it. I had spent the past two weeks dabbing on the last few brushstrokes of a brand&#x2013;new canvas. The young gentleman who served as my inspiration had inherited a great deal of money, and he had apparently been using it for the kind of dreadful homicidal escapades that made me wish I was rich, too. Alexander Macauley was his name, though he called himself &#x201c;Zander,&#x201d; which seemed somewhat preppy to me, but perhaps that was the point. He was a dyed&#x2013;in&#x2013;the&#x2013;wool trust&#x2013;fund hippie, after all, someone who had never done any real work, devoting himself entirely to lighthearted amusement of the kind that would have made my hollow heart go pitter&#x2013;pat, if only Zander had shown slightly better taste in choosing his victims.<br><br>The Macauley family&#x2019;s money came from vast hordes of cattle, endless citrus groves, and dumping phosphates into Lake Okeechobee. Zander came frequently to the poor areas of town to pour out his largesse across the city&#x2019;s homeless. And the favored few he really wished to encourage he reportedly brought back to the family ranch and gave employment, as I learned from a teary&#x2013;eyed and admiring newspaper article.<br><br>Of course Dexter always applauds the charitable spirit. But in general, I am so very much in favor of it because it is nearly always a warning sign that something nefarious, wicked, and playful is going on behind the Mother Teresa mask. Not that I would ever doubt that somewhere in the depths of the human heart there really and truly does live a spirit of kind and caring charity, mingled with the love of fellow man. Of course it does. I mean, I'm sure it must be in there somewhere. I&#x2019;ve just never seen it. And since I lack both humanity and real heart, I am forced to rely on experience, which tells me that charity begins at home, and almost always ends there, too.<br><br>So when I see a young, wealthy, handsome, and otherwise normal-appearing young man lavishing his resources on the vile downtrodden of the earth, I find it difficult to accept the altruism at face value, no matter how beautifully presented. After all, I am fairly good at presenting a charming and innocent picture of myself, and we know how accurate that is, don&#x2019;t we?<br><br>Happily for my consistent worldview, Zander was no different&#x2014;just a lot richer. And his inherited money had made him a little bit sloppy. Because in the meticulous tax records I uncovered, the family ranch appeared to be unoccupied and idle, which clearly meant that wherever he was taking his dear dirty friends, it was not to a healthy and happy life of country labor.<br><br>Even better for my purposes, wherever they went with their new friend Zander, they were going barefoot. Because in a special room at his lovely Coral Gables home, guarded by some very cunning and expensive locks that took me almost five full minutes to pick, Zander had saved some souvenirs. It&#x2019;s a foolish risk for a monster to take; I know this full well, since I do it myself. But if someday a hardworking investigator comes across my little box of memories, he will find no more than some glass slides, each with a single drop of blood preserved upon it, and no way ever to prove that any of them is anything sinister at all.<br><br>Zander was not quite so clever. He had saved a shoe from each of his victims, and counted on too much money and a locked door to keep his secrets safe.<br><br>Well really. No wonder monsters get such a bad reputation. It was just too naive for words&#x2014;and shoes? Seriously, shoes, by all that&#x2019;s unholy? I try to be tolerant and understanding of the foibles of others, but this was a bit much. What could possibly be the attraction in a sweaty, slime&#x2013;encrusted, twenty&#x2013;year&#x2013;old sneaker? And then to leave them right out in the open like that, too. It was almost insulting.<br><br>Of course, Zander probably thought that if he was ever caught he could count on buying the best legal care in the world, who would surely get him off with only community service&#x2014;a little ironic, since that was how it had all started. But one thing he had not counted on was being caught by Dexter instead of the police. And his trial would take place in the Traffic Court of the Dark Passenger, in which there are no lawyers&#x2014;although I certainly hope to catch one someday soon&#x2014;and the verdict is always absolutely final.</p><h2>The Wellness Workbook, 3rd ed: How to Achieve Enduring Health and Vitality</h2><p><p>For more than thirty years, John W.

There, amidst the city&#x2019;s bustling streets, elegant museums, passionate politics, and infamous cabarets, a chance meeting with a beautiful half-Jewish artist transforms him forever. Caught between his desire for freedom from tradition and his yearning to belong, he struggles to hold on to the new life he has found with the woman he loves. <br> &nbsp;<br> Emotionally powerful, intensely atmospheric, and touchingly profound, <i>Madonna in a Fur Coat</i> is an unforgettable novel about new beginnings, the relentless pull of family ties, and the unfathomable nature of the human soul. First published in 1943, this novel, with its quiet yet insistent defiance of social norms, has been topping best-seller lists in Turkey since 2013.</p><p><b>Sabahattin Ali </b>was born in 1907 in the Ottoman town of E&#x11f;ridere (now Ardino, in southern Bulgaria).

A frequent target of government censorship,<i> </i>he was imprisoned twice for his writings and was killed on the Bulgarian border in 1948 as he attempted to flee Turkey.

"Why is it that even in the way you beg, there is dominance, and pity in the way we refuse?" Maria asks Raif in what becomes a powerful monologue on female empowerment. In equal measure, Ali explores preconceptions of masculinity through Raif's vulnerability and his capacity for intimacy. Relationships are endangered, he shows, by misunderstanding and misjudgment more than malice.... English translation conveys the author's emotional intelligence and crisp lyricism.

Later, on the express train into town, the impression was strengthened by the scattering of pines, palms, and cypresses along the tracks. I became aware for the first time of how plant life is part of the story of being in a foreign place. As the eye adjusts to different buildings and different uses of technology, as the ear begins to find its way into the local dialect, the flora, too, present a challenge to the senses. Here, the biome projected a certain obstinacy: these plants had struggled against both human culture and hot weather for a long time.&nbsp;<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t hot the day we arrived. It was cool, the fog interleaved with rain, spoiling visibility.<br> A woman from Verona, her ticket on her lap, sat across from us. She wore a business suit and sunglasses, and had the slight impatience of early morning work--related travel. On the other side of the aisle was a middle-aged couple, the man in a blue tracksuit (which at the belly strained to contain him). Facing them, a sharply dressed young man in dark blue suit, powder--blue shirt, and skinny black tie spoke loudly into the telephone&#x2014;&#x201c;Pronto! S�, s�. S�, s�, s�! Andiamo, ciao, ciao!&#x201d;&#x2014;a&nbsp;clipped bare-bones negotiation. There was a performative busyness in his torrent of s�&#x2019;s; negotium, the negation of pleasure.<br><br> Italy is a Third World country. It has the ostentatious contrasts as well as the brittle pride. The greenery of Fiumicino quickly gave way to abandoned buildings with rusted roofs. We rumbled by a necropolis of wrecked cars in a wide yard, beyond which were muddy roads stretching back into the country and ceasing to be roads, become just muddy fields. On the culverts and walls, as those became more numerous, graffiti artists were indefatigable, covering every available surface. The tags were beautiful: they answered to the ancient ruins. The ruins themselves were as elaborate as stretches of aqueduct, or as simple as sections of broken wall. Their size as well as their integration into the landscape was the first real sign of the ubiquity of the past in Rome. In many places this past was elaborated and curated (as I would soon discover), but in others it was entirely untouched, the material relics simply remaining there, a testament to thousands of years of decay, an echo of the wealth and greatness of the people who lived here.<br><br> The suburban tenements soon appeared, festooned with washing, and increasingly small patches of open land on which flocks of tough-looking sheep grazed. By the time we arrived at Termini, the rain had begun again, this time heavily. We knew which bus we wanted, but there were no bus maps (everyone else seemed to know where to go). Finding the right embarkation point consisted of walking from one section of the parking lot to another, and we were drenched by the time we did find it. But time quickened, and we were soon inside Rome proper, in the Esquiline (one of the original seven hills), inside what felt like a gigantic Cinecitt� set.<br><br> I was intoxicated by the visual impression of the place: the large well-laid-out squares, the dilapidated but elegant buildings, the Vespas, the mid--century modern feel of much of the signage, the ragged edges on everything (for some reason all this made me think of Julian Schnabel). It was alluring, even in winter, perhaps especially in winter, with the colors warm and bold (orange, red, and yellow), but somewhat desaturated. As we passed through Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, I noted the gargantuan scale of the built environment, and the profusion of ornament.<br> Both scale and ornament are related to history. &#x201c;The classics&#x201d; are not homogeneous. But what distinguishes Roman art from Greek art? I go with this impression: the Greeks were idealists, invested in the perfection of form, fixated on eternity. Isn&#x2019;t the way people die in the <i>Iliad,</i> sorrowfully but not without a certain dignity, part of the attraction? I thought of your love for the Greeks, Beth, which is related to this dignity. The Romans, who later adopted their forms with a startling exactness&#x2014;much of what we know of Greek art is from Roman copies&#x2014;were more grounded: they got more complicatedly into the preexisting questions of political advantage, obsequy, national honor, and, of course, empire. Propaganda became more vivid than ever. And so, the buildings got larger and more ornate, lurid even, ostensibly to honor the gods or the predecessor rulers (many of whom were deified), but in reality as guarantees of personal glory. The Greeks loved philosophy for its own sake, more or less, but the Romans loved it for what it could be used for, namely political power. This at least was the way I understood it&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll forgive a traveler&#x2019;s generalizations.<br><br> Roman propaganda, the manipulation of images for political ends, hadn&#x2019;t begun with Augustus, Julius Caesar&#x2019;s successor and the first of the emperors, but he&#x2019;d certainly brought it to a keen level. He&#x2019;d enlisted architects and sculptors for the project of transforming him from violent claimant to the leadership&#x2014;a&nbsp;position for which he was neither more nor less qualified than his main rival, Mark Antony&#x2014;to Pater Patriae. The message, which got through, was that he was not merely fatherly but also avuncular. He was powerful, well loved, generous, and his leadership was inevitable.<br><br> Augustus&#x2019;s successful marshaling of art to the shaping of his image was the template for just about every emperor who came afterward. The skill and subtlety of Roman art, from the first-century emperors to Constantine in the fourth, was for the most part dedicated to dynastic and propagandistic goals. Was there after all, I asked myself, so great a leap between imperial Rome and the buffoonery of Mussolini? The misuse of piety was no new thing.<br><br> And so, on that first day, heading out in the late afternoon to the Capitoline Hill&#x2014;the ancient site of an important temple to Jupiter, now a set of museums around a Michelangelo-designed piazza&#x2014;I was braced for a mental separation between art and its public functions. I came up Michelangelo&#x2019;s broad, ramped staircase, past the monumental sculptures of Castor and Pollux, into the glistening egg-shaped piazza. The rain had ceased. Not many people were around. I had my arsenal of doubts at the ready.<br><br> But I want to set parentheses around this essay, Beth. It&#x2019;s no good pretending that, in going to Rome in 2009, one has gone to some exotic corner of the earth. Rome was as central a center of the world as there has been in this world. And now that there are many centers, it remains one of the important ones. So, I want to acknowledge not only that millions of other visitors do what I just did&#x2014;visit Rome as tourists or pilgrims&#x2014;but that this has been going on for a great long while. Those visitors have included many of the world&#x2019;s best writers, and, in addition, many of the world&#x2019;s great writers have been themselves Romans. I am unlikely to write anything new or penetrating about Rome. In writing about Rome, I am writing about art and history and politics, and how those things relate particularly to me, a solitary observer with a necessarily narrow, a necessarily shallow, view of the place. Rome is simply the pretext, and the font of specifics, for the discontinuous thoughts of a first-time traveler.<br><br> And while I&#x2019;m at it, I also want to question the very possibility of writing anything about a people, in this particular case Romans. Is it possible, I wonder, to write a sentence that begins &#x201c;Romans are . . . ,&#x201d; and have such a sentence be interesting and truthful at the same time? We are properly skeptical of gen-eralizations, after a lifetime of &#x201c;blacks are . . . ,&#x201d; &#x201c;women are . . . ,&#x201d; &#x201c;Indians are . . . ,&#x201d; &#x201c;Pakistanis are . . .&#x201d;<br><br> But an important part of the Roman enterprise, historically speaking, was the effort to characterize Rome and what it meant to be a Roman. This went beyond local pride, and also beyond imperial ambition. It was a certain relationship to fellow citizens and to the state, a relationship aided by war and by oratory. Principles were important, they were fought over if necessary, and any and all hypocrisies had to be practiced under the aegis of the principles. The motto SPQR (Senatus Populusque Romanus: a reminder that a given enterprise or monument was there at the pleasure of the senate and people of Rome) simply manifested the principles at stake.<br><br> Rome followed the example of Athens in this (think of Pericles&#x2019;s funeral oration, which had more sly jingoism than an American campaign speech) and would herself later serve as exemplum for the American experiment. Before American exceptionalism, there was Roman exceptionalism, to a much more severe degree. Our Capitol is named for the Capitoline Hill. Close parentheses.<br><br> Thus primed with my skepticism, a skepticism compounded with an anticolonial instinct, I entered the museums on the Capitoline Hill. Well: so much for preparation. I was floored. My theories simply had no chance against what I experienced&#x2014;the finest collection of classical statuary I had ever seen. The strength of the collection was not limited to the famous pieces&#x2014;the <i>Capitoline Venus,</i> the <i>Dying Gaul,</i> the <i>Colossus of Constantine</i>&#x2014;wonderful though they were. There were countless other sculptures, including several, such as a standing Hermes, that would have been the proud centerpieces of lesser collections. The patron of boundaries wore his winged hat and winged sandals, held a caduceus in his hand&#x2014;what a wonder to meet Hermes where Hermes meant so much. But what struck me most was the rooms full of marble portrait busts.<br><br> Ancient Roman marble portraiture rose to a very high degree of competence. It was an art that had been less thoroughly pursued by the Greeks, invested as they were in ideal forms. The fascination of Roman portraiture for me was twofold. First, I was struck by how subject to fashions it was, how, within the space of thirty or forty years, there were perceptible shifts in the sculptural style. The pendulum swung between &#x201c;veristic&#x201d; and &#x201c;idealizing&#x201d; techniques. A female portrait from the second century c.e., for instance, is rather easy to identify: the sculptors depicted the corkscrew hairstyle of the time in careful detail, and made extensive use of the drill (to poke holes in the marble, and give the hair an illusion of depth). Drills were used, too, in portraits of men during this period: after Hadrian&#x2019;s decision to wear one, beards were all the rage, and they were sculpted in marble with drills. By the time of Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus (both bearded), portraiture had reached new levels of psychological acuity. To the realistic depiction of age and wrinkles, which was itself a conscious throwback to the portraiture of the Roman republic, there were now added indications of the subjects&#x2019; frame of mind: melancholy, levity, exhaustion, fleeting states set in stone.<br><br> Among the many representations of the gods and emperors and senators were busts of ordinary citizens. What these portraits showed was that ordinary Romans participated intimately in this image economy. I was right to have been aware of the propagandistic aspect of image making, but not to the extent of forgetting how widespread and common images themselves were, and how generally sophisticated the ability to read them. One estimate puts the number of sculptures in Rome in the second century at 2 million. History tends to favor rulers and warriors, but the history that peered at me from the white marble faces on the Capitoline was closer to ground level: bakers, soldiers, courtesans, writers. It was a history of involvement and implication in the Roman project.<br><br> Whatever Rome was, or whatever it had been, it was so out of the enthusiasm of the people of Rome for Roman modes of being. The sculptures were one part of that. They were a way of expressing a desire to be honored and to be remembered. That the results were so visually arresting was no coincidence. The visual propaganda of the emperors would not have been so forceful had the populace not been already attuned to imagery.<br><br> So, &#x201c;Romans are . . .&#x201d; what? Romans are people who are part of Rome, and would rather be part of Rome. To be Roman was to participate in Rome. That was my inkling on the first day. But, of course, that inkling was not to last the week without revision.<br><br> &#x201c;We are working hard. In fact we&#x2019;re just hustling. It&#x2019;s not easy at all,&#x201d; Moses said. He&#x2019;d made little room for small talk or pleasantries. A certain bitterness was evident in his voice. Moses was a friend of Paula&#x2019;s, and she&#x2019;d introduced him to me because he was a Nigerian, an Ibo. Before he came to the house, she&#x2019;d told me that he was a building contractor. &#x201c;He is in partnership with an Italian. You know why? If you have an employee, there are rules, you must pay a certain amount, of taxes, of benefits, a certain minimum salary. But if you are &#x2018;partners,&#x2019; then there is no responsibility. And so this man cheats him by making him a partner; Italians cheat foreign employees this way. They painted this house, but I don&#x2019;t know who pocketed the money.&#x201d;<br><br> Moses&#x2019;s sober mien and sharp comments confirmed this picture. &#x201c;Our problem is that when we go home, when we are there for a few days, we spend one thousand euros. And everyone thinks that life must be luxurious for us overseas. They think we live in palaces here. It is not so, but they don&#x2019;t know that. They get on the next flight and come. They meet a bad situation in Rome.&#x201d; I asked him about the Nigerian community in Rome. &#x201c;There are many of us,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;not as many as Turin&#x2014;-you know, that&#x2019;s where our women are, mostly, doing, you know&#x2014;-but our people are always how they are. You know our people. No Nigerian helps you unless you help them first, unless you pay them money. Nothing is free. There is no help. I&#x2019;ve been in this country now nine years, and everything is still a struggle. Especially for those of us who don&#x2019;t have much education.&#x201d;<br><br> Moses spoke fluent Italian, and he wore a well-cut brown suit, a blush-colored tie, oxblood brogues. His mustache was meticulously trimmed to a slightly comical half-inch-thick strip on either side of his philtrum. There was no particular warmth in his interaction with me, confessional though it was. His presentation was smart, his manner courtly, a contractor dressed like a dandy; but the tone was all exhaustion. A miserable cry of exhaustion. &#x201c;Our women&#x201d; to describe the Nigerian prostitutes in Turin was, I thought, part of his resigned attitude. No activist he, just a brother trying to survive.<br><br> Paula was Italian, and separated from her husband. She ran the bed-and-breakfast with the help of a business partner. The husband, Carlo, helped when she needed it. We&#x2019;d met him on the first day&#x2014;an evasive, thin-faced man&#x2014;and hadn&#x2019;t seen him since. Their split was recent. Paula herself was warm, an &#x201c;accidental Italian&#x201d; as she saw it, much more interested in Latin America, in salsa and tango, and in learning English.<br><br> One evening, at the kitchen table of her beautiful home, she said, &#x201c;Have you read Saviano? Everyone here read this book. It&#x2019;s so sad, no? I feel such deep shame for my country.&#x201d; Roberto Savi...</p><h2>The New Yiddish Kitchen: Gluten-Free and Paleo Kosher Recipes for the Holidays and Every Day</h2><p><p>Traditional Jewish Meals Made Healthier</p><p>From two leaders in the Paleo cooking community, <i>The New Yiddish Kitchen</i> is a fresh and healthful take on a beloved food tradition.

Instead, he was sent to India &#x2013; the first stop on a decades-long tour of the world that took Kapuscinski from Iran to El Salvador, from Angola to Armenia. Revisiting his memories of traveling the globe with a copy of Herodotus' <i>Histories</i> in tow, Kapuscinski describes his awakening to the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of new environments, and how the words of the Greek historiographer helped shape his own view of an increasingly globalized world. Written with supreme eloquence and a constant eye to the global undercurrents that have shaped the last half-century, <i>Travels with Herodotus</i> is an exceptional chronicle of one man's journey across continents.</p><p><b>Ryszard Kapuscinski</b>, Poland's most celebrated foreign correspondent, was born in 1932. After graduating with a degree in history from Warsaw University, he was sent to India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to report for the Polish news, which began his lifelong fascination with the Third World. During his four decades reporting on Asia, Latin America, and Africa, he befriended Che Guevara, Salvador Allende, and Patrice Lumumba; witnessed twentyseven coups and revolutions; and was sentenced to death four times. He died in 2007.His earlier books--<i>Shah of Shahs, The Emperor, Imperium, Another Day of Life, The Soccer War, </i>and <i>Shadow of the Sun</i>--have been translated into nineteen languages.CROSSING THE BORDERBefore Herodotus sets out on his travels, ascending rocky paths, sailing a ship over the seas, riding on horseback through the wilds of Asia; before he happens upon the mistrustful Scythians, discovers the wonders of Babylon, and plumbs the mysteries of the Nile; before he experiences a hundred different places and sees a thousand inconceivable things, he will appear for a moment in a lecture on ancient Greece, which Professor Biezunska-Malowist delivers twice weekly to the first-year students in Warsaw University&#39;s department of history.He will appear and just as quickly vanish.He will disappear so completely that now, years later, when I look through my notes from those classes, I do not find his name. There are Aeschylus and Pericles, Sappho and Socrates, Heraclitus and Plato; but no Herodotus. And yet we took such careful notes. They were our only source of information. The war had ended six years earlier, and the city lay in ruins. Libraries had gone up in flames, we had no textbooks, no books at all to speak of.The professor has a calm, soft, even voice. Her dark, attentive eyes regard us through thick lenses with marked curiosity. Sitting at a high lectern, she has before her a hundred young people the majority of whom have no idea that Solon was great, do not know the cause of Antigone&#39;s despair, and could not explain how Themistocles lured the Persians into a trap.If truth be told, we didn&#39;t even quite know where Greece was or, for that matter, that a contemporary country by that name had a past so remarkable and extraordinary as to merit studying at university. We were children of war. High schools were closed during the war years, and although in the larger cities clandestine classes were occasionally convened, here, in this lecture hall, sat mostly girls and boys from remote villages and small towns, ill read, undereducated. It was 1951. University admissions were granted without entrance examinations, family provenance mattering most--in the communist state the children of workers and peasants had the best chances of getting in.The benches were long, meant for several students, but they were still too few and so we sat crowded together. To my left was Z.--a taciturn peasant from a village near Radomsko, the kind of place where, as he once told me, a household would keep a piece of dried kielbasa as medicine: if an infant fell ill, it would be given the kielbasa to suck. &#34;Did that help?&#34; I asked, skeptically. &#34;Of course,&#34; he replied with conviction and fell into gloomy silence again. To my right sat skinny W., with his emaciated, pockmarked face. He moaned with pain whenever the weather changed; he said he had taken a bullet in the knee during a forest battle. But who was fighting against whom, and exactly who shot him, this he would not say. There were also several students from better families among us. They were neatly attired, had nicer clothes, and the girls wore high heels. Yet they were striking exceptions, rare occurrences--the poor, uncouth countryside predominated: wrinkled coats from army surplus, patched sweaters, percale dresses.The professor showed us photographs of antique sculptures and of Greek figures painted on brown vases--beautiful, statuesque bodies, noble, elongated faces with fine features. They belonged to some unknown, mythic universe, a world of sun and silver, warm and full of light, populated by slender heroes and dancing nymphs. We didn&#39;t know what to make of it. Looking at the photographs, Z. was morosely silent and W. contorted himself to massage his aching knee. Others looked on, attentive yet indifferent. Before those future prophets proclaiming the clash of civilizations, the collision was taking place long ago, twice a week, in the lecture hall where I learned that there once lived a Greek named Herodotus.I knew nothing as yet of his life, or about the fact that he left us a famous book. We would in any event have been unable to read The Histories, because at that moment its Polish translation was locked away in a closet. In the mid-1940s The Histories had been translated by Professor Seweryn Hammer, who deposited his manuscript in the Czytelnik publishing house. I was unable to ascertain the details because all the documentation disappeared, but it happens that Hammer&#39;s text was sent by the publisher to the typesetter in the fall of 1951. Barring any complications, the book should have appeared in 1952, in time to find its way into our hands while we were still studying ancient history. But that&#39;s not what happened, because the printing was suddenly halted. Who gave the order? Probably the censor, but it&#39;s impossible to know for certain. Suffice it to say that the book finally did not go to press until three years later, at the end of 1954, arriving in the bookstores in 1955.One can speculate about the delay in the publication of The Histories. It coincides with the period preceding the death of Stalin and the time immediately following it. The Herodotus manuscript arrived at the press just as Western radio stations began speaking of Stalin&#39;s serious illness. The details were murky, but people were afraid of a new wave of terror and preferred to lie low, to risk nothing, to give no one any pretext, to wait things out. The atmosphere was tense. The censors redoubled their vigilance.But Herodotus? A book written two and a half thousand years ago? Well, yes: because all our thinking, our looking and reading, was governed during those years by an obsession with allusion. Each word brought another one to mind; each had a double meaning, a false bottom, a hidden significance; each contained something secretly encoded, cunningly concealed. Nothing was ever plain, literal, unambiguous--from behind every gesture and word peered some referential sign, gazed a meaningfully winking eye. The man who wrote had difficulty communicating with the man who read, not only because the censor could confiscate the text en route, but also because, when the text finally reached him, the latter read something utterly different from what was clearly written, constantly asking himself: What did this author really want to tell me?And so a person consumed, obsessively tormented by allusion reaches for Herodotus. How many allusions he will find there! The Histories consists of nine books, and each one is allusions heaped upon allusions. Let us say he opens, quite by accident, Book Five. He opens it, reads, and learns that in Corinth, after thirty years of bloodthirsty rule, the tyrant called Cypselus died and was succeeded by his son, Periander, who would in time turn out to be even more bloodthirsty than his father. This Periander, when he was still a dictator-in-training, wanted to learn how to stay in power, and so sent a messenger to the dictator of Miletus, old Thrasybulus, asking him for advice on how best to keep a people in slavish fear and subjugation.Thrasybulus, writes Herodotus, took the man sent by Periander out of the city and into a field where there were crops growing. As he walked through the grain, he kept questioning the messenger and getting him to repeat over and over again what he had come from Corinth to ask. Meanwhile, every time he saw an ear of grain standing higher than the rest, he broke it off and threw it away, and he went on doing this until he had destroyed the choicest, tallest stems in the crop. After this walk across the field, Thrasybulus sent Periander&#39;s man back home, without having offered him any advice. When the man got back to Corinth, Periander was eager to hear Thrasybulus&#39; recommendations, but the agent said that he had not made any at all. In fact, he said, he was surprised that Periander had sent him to a man of that kind--a lunatic who destroyed his own property--and he described what he had seen Thrasybulus doing.Periander, however, understood Thrasybulus&#39; actions. He realized that he had been advising him to kill outstanding citizens, and from then on he treated his people with unremitting brutality. If Cypselus had left anything undone during his spell of slaughter and persecution, Periander finished the job.And gloomy, maniacally suspicious Cambyses? How many allusions, analogies, and parallels in this figure! Cambyses was the king of a great contemporary power, Persia. He ruled between 529 and 522 B.C.E.Everything goes to make me certain that Cambyses was completely mad . . . His first atrocity was to do away with his brother Smerdis . . . and the second was to do away with his sister, who had come with him to Egypt. She was also his wife, as well as being his full sister . . . [and] on another occasion he found twelve of the highest-ranking Persians guilty of a paltry misdemeanour and buried them alive up to their necks in the ground. . . . These are a few examples of the insanity of his behaviour towards the Persians and his allies. During his time in Memphis he even opened some ancient tombs and examined the corpses.Cambyses . . . set out to attack the Ethiopians, without having requisitioned supplies or considered the fact that he was intending to make an expedition to the ends of the earth . . . so enraged and insane that he just set off with all his land forces . . . However, they completely ran out of food before they had got a fifth of the way there, and then they ran out of yoke-animals as well, because they were all eaten up. Had Cambyses changed his mind when he saw what was happening, and turned back, he would have redeemed his original mistake by acting wisely; in fact, however, he paid no attention to the situation and continued to press on. As long as there were plants to scavenge, his men could stay alive by eating grass, but then they reached the sandy desert. At that point some of them did something dreadful: they cast lots to choose one in every ten men among them--and ate him. When Cambyses heard about this, fear of cannibalism made him abandon his expedition to Ethiopia and turn his men back.As I mentioned, Herodotus&#39;s opus appeared in the bookstores in 1955. Two years had passed since Stalin&#39;s death. The atmosphere became more relaxed, people breathed more freely. Ilya Ehrenburg&#39;s novel The Thaw had just appeared, its title lending itself to the new epoch just beginning. Literature seemed to be everything then. People looked to it for the strength to live, for guidance, for revelation.I completed my studies and began working at a newspaper. It was called Sztandar Mtodych (The Banner of Youth). I was a novice reporter and my beat was to follow the trail of letters sent to the editor back to their points of origin. The writers complained about injustice and poverty, about the fact that the state took their last cow or that their village was still without electricity. Censorship abated and one could write, for example, that in the village of Chodow there is a store but that its shelves are always bare and there is never anything to buy. Progress consisted of the fact that while Stalin was alive, one could not write that a store was empty--all of them had to be excellently stocked, bursting with wares. I rattled along from village to village, from town to town, in a hay cart or a rickety bus, for private cars were a rarity and even a bicycle wasn&#39;t easily to be had.My route sometimes took me to villages along the border. But this happened infrequently. For the closer one got to a border, the emptier grew the land and the fewer people one encountered. This emptiness increased the mystery of these regions. I was struck, too, by how silent the border zone was. This mystery and quiet attracted and intrigued me. I was tempted to see what lay beyond, on the other side. I wondered what one experiences when one crosses the border. What does one feel? What does one think? It must be a moment of great emotion, agitation, tension. What is it like, on the other side? It must certainly be--different. But what does &#34;different&#34; mean? What does it look like? What does it resemble? Maybe it resembles nothing that I know, and thus is inconceivable, unimaginable? And so my greatest desire, which gave me no peace, which tormented and tantalized me, was actually quite modest: I wanted one thing only--the moment, the act, the simple fact of crossing the border. To cross it and come right back--that, I thought, would be entirely sufficient, would satisfy my quite inexplicable yet acute psychological hunger.But how to do this? None of my friends from school or university had ever been abroad. Anyone with a contact in another country generally preferred not to advertise it. I was even cross with myself for this bizarre yen; still, it didn&#39;t abate for a moment.One day I encountered my editor in chief in the hallway. Irena Tarlowska was a strapping, handsome woman with thick blond hair parted to one side. She said something about my recent stories, and then asked me about my plans for the near future. I named various villages to which I would be going, the issues that awaited me there, and then summoned my courage and said: &#34;One day, I would very much like to go abroad.&#34;&#34;Abroad?&#34; she said, surprised and slightly frightened, because in those days going abroad was no ordinary matter. &#34;Where? What for?&#34; she asked.&#34;I was thinking about Czechoslovakia,&#34; I answered. I wouldn&#39;t have dared to say something like Paris or London, and frankly they didn&#39;t really interest me; I couldn&#39;t even imagine them. This was only about crossing the border--somewhere. It made no difference which one, because what was important was not the destination, the goal, the end, but the almost mystical and transcendent act. Crossing the border.A year passed following that conversation. The telephone rang in our newsroom. The editor in chief was summoning me to her office. &#34;You know,&#34; she said, as I stood before her desk, &#34;we are sending you. You&#39;ll go to India.&#34;My first reaction was astonishment. And right after that, panic: I knew nothing about India. I feverishly searched my thoughts for some associations, images, names. Nothing. Zero. (The idea of an Indian trip originated in the fact that several months earlier Jawaharlal Nehru had visited Poland, the first premier of a non-Soviet-bloc country to do so. The first contacts were being established. My stories were to bring that distant land closer.)At the end of our conversation, during which I learned that I would indeed be going forth into the world, Tarlowska reached into a cabinet, took out a book, and handing it to me said: &#34;Here, a present, for the road.&#34;</p><h2>Supernormal: Science, Yoga, and the Evidence for Extraordinary Psychic Abilities</h2><p>Can yoga and meditation unleash our inherent supernormal mental powers, such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and precognition? Is it really possible to perceive another person's thoughts and intentions? Influence objects with our minds? Envision future events? And is it possible that some of the superpowers described in ancient legends, science fiction, and comic books are actually real, and patiently waiting for us behind the scenes? Are we now poised for an evolutionary trigger to pull the switch and release our full potentials?<br><br>Dean Radin, Director of Research at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) and bestselling author of <i>The Conscious Universe, </i>presents persuasive new experimental evidence for the existence of such phenomena. He takes us on a thrilling scientific journey and challenges outdated assumptions that these abilities are mere superstition. Focusing on Patanjali's mysterious <i>Yoga Sutras </i>-- 2,000 year-old meditation practices believed to release our extraordinary powers -- Radin offers powerful evidence confirming that sometimes fact is much stranger, spookier, and more wonderful than the wildest fiction.</p><p>Dean Radin, PhD, is the author of Entangled Minds and The Conscious Universe. For more than two decades he has been engaged in research on the frontiers of consciousness. He has held appointments at Princeton University and several Silicon Valley think tanks, including SRI International, where he worked on a classified program investigating psychic phenomena for the US government.Chapter 1<br><br>Introduction<br><br>Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end; then stop.<br><br>--Lewis Carroll<br><br>We begin with a simple question: Was Buddha just a nice guy?<br><br>Did Buddha&#x2019;s teachings thrive because he was more attractive or charismatic than most, or because he was a great teacher and a tireless advocate of the poor? Or--and here&#x2019;s the core question we&#x2019;ll explore in detail--was it also because he was an enlightened being with profound insights into the nature of Reality, and because he possessed supernormal abilities?<br><br>We might ask the same questions about Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Milarepa, or a host of other historically prominent figures associated with special illumination, wisdom, or grace. Did these people just sport great tans and know how to work a crowd, or did they understand something genuinely deep about the human condition, and our capacities, that is not yet within the purview of science?<br><br>If it&#x2019;s too touchy to ask such questions about religious icons, then we may consider a more contemporary figure: The Dalai Lama regularly hosts discussions between scientists and Buddhist monks. Do the Western scientists who compete for a coveted slot at those meetings secretly believe that he&#x2019;s a backward country bumpkin, and they&#x2019;re just humoring him long enough to get their photo taken with a famous Nobel laureate so they can post it on their Facebook page?<br><br>Given the glowing praise about those meetings in books and articles authored by no-nonsense science journalists, and a growing list of collaborators hailing from Harvard University, Stanford University, the University of Zurich, the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, and many others, it doesn&#x2019;t seem so. But the Dalai Lama takes reincarnation and the legendary yogic superpowers (the siddhis) seriously. He&#x2019;s claimed to see some of them in action, like oracles who accurately divine future tendencies.6 What does he know that most Western-trained scientists studiously ignore? Could the superpowers actually be real? If so, why haven&#x2019;t we read about them in science magazines?<br><br>Such questions have been debated by scholars and by ordinary people for millennia. In modern times, for the most part science has ignored or denigrated the mere possibility of superpowers because such abilities are not easily accommodated by Western scientific assumptions about the capacities of the human mind. It is also sidestepped because any answer offered is guaranteed to seriously annoy someone. If you say yes, &#x201c;Buddha was just a nice guy,&#x201d; then Buddhists will hurl epithets at you. They may do this in a kind and compassionate way, but you will still have to duck. If you say no, &#x201c;Buddha was something more,&#x201d; then you will have to dodge objects thrown with equal gusto by both scientists and devotees of other religions. As a result, for the sake of safety the question is usually left unanswered.<br><br>There will always be some who are not satisfied with this soft deflection. Cynics feel intense discomfort when questions are raised about the possibility of &#x201c;something more.&#x201d; They shout accusations of voodoo science, and they form posses to stop what they regard as ominous tides of irrationality from heading our way.7 Their concerns, bristling on the edge of hysteria, are not without justification. The promise of something secretly powerful, beyond the mundane, has been responsible for untold scams, conspiracies, and witch hunts throughout history. Civilization embraces superstitions and ignores rationality at its peril, so a legitimate case can be made that strenuous protection of hard-won knowledge is necessary.<br><br>But here&#x2019;s the rub: It is precisely because civilization must advance beyond superstition that we are obliged to carefully explore our inquiry about the existence of supernormal abilities. The answer is relevant to basic scientific assumptions about the nature of human potential, to the relationships among science, religion, and society, and without hyperbole, to the likelihood that humankind will continue to survive.<br><br>In addition, all the nervous fussing one hears about the need to combat superstition, the wringing of hands about looming threats to rationality--such behavior positively drips with emotion, and that presents its own cause for concern. As British psychiatrist Anthony Storr wrote in Feet of Clay: A Study of Gurus, &#x201c;Whether a belief is considered to be a delusion or not depends partly upon the intensity with which it is defended, and partly upon the numbers of people subscribing to it&#x201d;(p. 199).8 When it comes to the possibility of superpowers, many are energetically engaged in either strident offenses or frenzied defenses, adding precious little reason to the debate.<br><br>But something new can now be brought to the discussion: empirical evidence. Laboratory data amassed over many decades suggest that some of what the yogis, mystics, saints, and shaman have claimed is probably right. And that means some of today&#x2019;s scientific assumptions are probably wrong.<br><br>If you can&#x2019;t stomach the thought that what you&#x2019;ve learned in school might not be completely correct (in spite of the fact that textbooks are regularly revised), then rest assured: This does not mean that all the textbooks must be thrown away. Sizable portions of the existing scientific worldview are quite stable and will remain accurate enough for all practical purposes for a long time.<br><br>But it does mean that some of our assumptions, including a few fundamental ideas about who we are and the way the world works, are in need of revision. The newly developing worldview suggests, for example, that it is no longer tenable to imagine that the universe is a mindless clockwork mechanism. Something else seems to be going on, something involving the mind and consciousness in important ways.<br><br>After reviewing a substantial body of scientific evidence demonstrating that yoga can significantly improve physical health, New York Times journalist William Broad wrote in The Science of Yoga:<br>While the science of yoga may be demonstrably true--while its findings may be revelatory and may show popular declarations to be false or misleading--the field by nature fails utterly at producing a complete story. Many of yoga&#x2019;s truths surely go beyond the truths of science. Yoga may see further, and its advanced practitioners, for all I know, may frolic in fields of consciousness and spirituality of which science knows nothing. Or maybe it&#x2019;s all delusional nonsense. I have no idea.9 (p. 222)<br>Does science really know nothing about the more exotic claims of yoga? By the end of this book we&#x2019;ll have discovered that Broad didn&#x2019;t dig deep enough. We actually do know a few things.<br>Escape to Reality<br><br>Many ancient teachings tell us that we have the capacity to gain extraordinary powers through grit or grace. Techniques used to achieve these supernormal abilities, known as siddhis in the yoga tradition (from the Sanskrit, meaning &#x201c;perfection&#x201d;2, 5), include meditation, ecstatic dancing, drumming, praying, chanting, sexual practices, fasting, or ingesting psychedelic plants and mushrooms. In modern times, techniques also include participation in extreme sports, floating in isolation tanks, use of transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation, listening to binaural-beat audio tones, and neurofeedback.<br><br>Most of these techniques are ways of transcending the mundane. Those who yearn to escape from suffering or boredom may dive into a cornucopia of sedatives and narcotics. Others, drawn to the promise of a more meaningful reality, or a healthier mind and body, are attracted to yoga, meditation, or other mind-expanding or mind-body integrating techniques.<br><br>Transformative techniques are potent, and like any power they are seductive and rife with pitfalls. Yoga injuries can occur when enthusiasm overcomes common sense.9 Meditation can lead to extreme introversion, depression, or spiritual hedonism.10 But the human need to transcend the humdrum is formidable and easily overrides caution. We see this in two of the more popular transformational techniques available today--alcohol and tobacco. These two mind-altering substances are tightly integrated into the economic engines of the modern world. The average household in the United States spends more just on tobacco products and its paraphernalia than on fresh fruit and milk combined, and more on alcohol than on all other nonalcoholic beverages combined.11<br><br>The World Health Organization estimated that in 2007 the societal cost of alcohol-related diseases, accidents, and violence was over $200 billion a year in the United States alone.12 The purchase cost of alcohol was even greater, estimated at nearly $400 billion a year in 2008.13 There is a similar statistic for tobacco.14 The formidable human desire to escape, just considering these two products alone, costs society trillions of dollars a year. If we included the costs associated with the use and abuse of stimulants and recreational drugs, gambling, and the entertainment industry, the total expense is staggering, a sizable proportion of the world&#x2019;s economy. Humanity seems desperate to escape.<br><br>With banks and stock markets teetering at the edge of an apocalypse during the second decade of the twenty-first century, escaping outward has become too risky and too expensive for most people. What about escaping inward? Rarified minds tell us that they have seen something beautiful and glittering in our depths, something that promises a dramatic advancement in human potential. After seriously setting out on that path, most esoteric traditions say that we will eventually encounter genuine extraordinary phenomena, including the acquisition of supernormal powers.4<br>Yoga Superpowers<br><br>Classic yoga texts, such as Patanjali&#x2019;s Yoga Sutras, written about two thousand years ago, tell us in matter-of-fact terms that if you sit quietly, pay close attention to your mind, and practice this diligently, then you will gain supernormal powers.15&#x2013;19 These advanced capacities are not regarded as magical; they&#x2019;re ordinary capacities that everyone possesses. We&#x2019;re just too distracted most of the time to be able to access them reliably.<br><br>The sage Patanjali also tells us that these siddhis can be obtained by ingesting certain drugs, through contemplation of sacred symbols, repetition of mantras, ascetic practices, or through a fortuitous birth. In the yogic tradition, powers gained through use of mantras, amulets, or drugs are not regarded with as much respect, or considered to be as permanent, as those earned through dedicated meditative practice.5<br><br>The promise of these superpowers has little to do with traditional religious faith, divine intervention, or supernatural miracles. As Buddhist scholar Alan Wallace says,<br>In Buddhism, these are not miracles in the sense of being supernatural events, any more than the discovery and amazing uses of lasers are miraculous--however they may appear to those ignorant of the nature and potentials of light. Such contemplatives claim to have realized the nature and potentials of consciousness far beyond anything known in contemporary science. What may appear supernatural to a scientist or a layperson may seem perfectly natural to an advanced contemplative, much as certain technological advances may appear miraculous to a contemplative.20 (p. 103)<br>Yogic wisdom describes many variations of the siddhis. Today we&#x2019;d associate the elementary siddhis with garden-variety psychic phenomena. They include telepathy (mind-to-mind communication); clairvoyance (gaining information about distant or hidden objects beyond the reach of the ordinary senses); precognition (clairvoyance through time), and psychokinesis (direct influence of matter by mind, also known as PK).<br><br>For most people, psychic abilities manifest spontaneously and are rarely under conscious control. The experiences tend to be sporadic and fragmentary, and the most dramatic cases occur mainly during periods of extreme motivation. By contrast, the siddhis are said to be highly reliable and under complete conscious control; as such they could be interpreted as exceedingly refined, well-cultivated forms of psychic phenomena.<br><br>The more advanced siddhis are said to include invisibility, levitation, invulnerability, and superstrength, abilities often associated with comic book superheroes. All these abilities are also described in one form or another in shamanism and in the mystical teachings of religions. In fact, most cultures throughout history have taken for granted that superpowers are real, albeit rare, and surveys today continue to show that the majority of the world&#x2019;s population still firmly believes in one or more of these capacities.21<br><br>Mainstream science is not so sure. Many scientists and scholars trained within the Western worldview regard such powers not as supernormal capacities of the human mind, but as superstitions used solely to promote religious faith.22<br>Who&#x2019;s Right?<br><br>Who&#x2019;s more likely to be correct about the siddhis--the world&#x2019;s wisdom traditions or today&#x2019;s scientific orthodoxy? We will explore this question not by recitation of amazing stories, or by analysis of religious arguments, or by examination of case reports (although we will look at a few). Rather, we&#x2019;ll concentrate on controlled experimental evidence published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.<br><br>We will find that the scientific method is so powerful in discerning fact from fiction that a strong argument can be made in favor of some genuine siddhis. This is an example where scientific evidence trumps previously held assumptions, and it&#x2019;s also a demonstration of the power of science to pull itself up by its bootstraps and to change from within.<br><br>This is not to say that this evidence has been warmly embraced. All organized holders of knowledge, whether in scientific or religious contexts, strenuously resist change. We will explore this resistance as well, as it will help us understand why we are only vaguely aware of our true potentials.<br>2. Radin D. Entangled Minds.

His <i>Apologia</i>, written nearly twenty years later in response to a scurrilous public attack by Charles Kingsley, is a superbly crafted response to those who criticized his actions and questioned his motives, and traces his spiritual development since boyhood, his close involvement in the high church Tractarian Movement and his agonizing decision to reject the church he had been born into. Ostensibly an autobiography and a speech for the defence, the Apologia transcends self-justification to explore the very nature of Christianity and its place in the modern age.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.John Henry Newman stunned the Anglican community in 1843, when he left his position as vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford, to join the Roman Catholic church. Perhaps no one took greater offense than Protestant clergyman Charles Kingsley, whose scathing attacks against Newman's faith and honor inspired this brilliant response. <i>Apologia Pro Vita Sua,</i> Newman's spiritual autobiography, explores the depths and nature of Christianity with flowing prose and a conversational style that has ensured its status as a classic.<br>His honest and passionate defense consists of a personal history of his religious convictions, from earliest memory through the Oxford movement and his ultimate conversion. His concluding point-by-point refutation of Kingsley's charges features thought-provoking contentions that strike at the very roots of the principles underlying Protestantism. Newman won respect and admiration with his <i>Apologia,</i> a work that has helped clarify perceptions of Roman Catholicism among readers of every faith.</p><h2>The Cthulhu Casebooks - Sherlock Holmes and the Shadwell Shadows</h2><p><i>It is the autumn of 1880, and Dr John Watson has just returned from Afghanistan. Badly injured and desperate to forget a nightmarish expedition that left him doubting his sanity, Watson is close to destitution when he meets the extraordinary Sherlock Holmes, who is investigating a series of deaths in the Shadwell district of London. Several bodies have been found, the victims appearing to have starved to death over the course of several weeks, and yet they were reported alive and well mere days before. Moreover, there are disturbing reports of creeping shadows that inspire dread in any who stray too close.</i><br><i>Holmes deduces a connection between the deaths and a sinister drug lord who is seeking to expand his criminal empire.

A national bestseller, her empowering fable won the Western State Book Award in 1993 and the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Book Award in 1994. Translated into 16 languages, it went on to international success, quickly reaching bestseller status in Germany. To date, more than 350,000 copies have been sold worldwide. <p> <i>Bird Girl and the Man Who Followed the Sun</i> follows in this bestselling tradition. Rooted in the ancient legends of Alaska's Athabaskan Indians, it tells the stories of two adventurers who decide to leave the safety of their respective tribes. Bird Girl is a headstrong young woman who learned early on the skills of a hunter. When told that she must end her forays and take up the traditional role of wife and mother, she defies her family's expectations and confidently takes off to brave life on her own. Daagoo is a dreamer, curious about the world beyond. Longing to know what happens to the sun in winter, he sets out on a quest to find the legendary "Land of the Sun." Their stories interweave and intersect as they each face the many dangers and challenges of life alone in the wilderness. In the end, both learn that the search for individualism often comes at a high price, but that it is a price well worth paying, for through this quest comes the beginning of true wisdom.</p></p><p>Velma Wallis, author of the award-winning TWO OLD WOMEN, brings forth another story from the Athabaskans of Alaska. In a cold, harsh country where the sun disappears for much of the long winter, Indians and Eskimos struggle against nature and one another to survive. Against this stark landscape, Wallis skillfully interweaves the stories of two rebels. Bird Girl, an independent young Indian woman, defies her family's expectations by refusing to become a traditional wife and mother. Instead she chooses to brave life on her own as a hunter, risking starvation, isolation, and attacks by her people's enemies, the Eskimos.

Where Caesar's own account leaves off in 48 BC, his lieutenants take up the history, describing the vital battles of Munda, Spain and Thapsus, and the installation of Cleopatra, later Caesar's mistress, as Queen of Egypt. Together these narratives paint a full picture of the events that brought Caesar supreme power - and paved the way for his assassination only months later.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

He was imprisoned for a time with his familly, for protesting against the then leadership of Sulla, but advanced slowly through the sixties rising to the rank of praetor and forming the 'first triumvirate' with Pompey and Crassus. Elected consul in 59BC, he then became Governor for Transalpine Gaul. After the death of Crassus and the defeat of Pompey in 45BC, Caesar returned to Rome as dictator.

We all need affirmation, acceptance, and approval. Let's face it: It feels good to be appreciated and admired. But when we depend on the approval of others to feel good about ourselves, it's impossible to have emotional stability or a healthy self-image. And when our value is based on how people see us rather than God's unconditional love for us, our desire for approval can become an addiction.<br> In THE APPROVAL FIX, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Joyce Meyer gives you practical insights that will help you learn how to accept who you are and become the unique individual God created you to be.

In the latter part of this curious masterwork, a certain Jacques Moran is deputized by anonymous authorities to search for the aforementioned Molloy. In the trilogy's second novel, Malone, who might or might not be Molloy himself, addresses us with his ruminations while in the act of dying. The third novel consists of the fragmented monologue&#x2013;delivered, like the monologues of the previous novels, in a mournful rhetoric that possesses the utmost splendor and beauty&#x2013;of what might or might not be an armless and legless creature living in an urn outside an eating house. Taken together, these three novels represent the high-water mark of the literary movement we call Modernism. Within their linguistic terrain, where stories are taken up, broken off, and taken up again, where voices rise and crumble and are resurrected, we can discern the essential lineaments of our modern condition, and encounter an awesome vision, tragic yet always compelling and always mysteriously invigorating, of consciousness trapped and struggling inside the boundaries of nature.</p></p><p>Samuel Beckett's brilliance as a dramatist--as the creator of <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, <i>Krapp's Last Tape</i>, and that despairing pas de deux <i>Endgame</i>--has tended to overshadow his gifts as a novelist. Yet he's unmistakably one of the great fiction writers of our century. As a young man he took dictation (literally) from James Joyce, and absorbed everything that myopic maestro had to offer when it came to Anglo-Irish prosody. Still, Beckett's instincts would ultimately steer him away from Joyce's delirious play with high and low diction, toward a more concentrated, even compulsive style. His earlier novels, like <i>Murphy</i> or <i>Watt</i>, give us a taste of what was to come. But Beckett truly hit his stride with a trilogy of early-1950s masterpieces: <i>Molloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable</i>. Here he dispenses with all the customary props of contemporary fiction--including exposition, plot, and increasingly, paragraphs--and turns his attention to consciousness itself. Nobody has ever evoked the pain of existence, or the steady slide toward nonexistence, with such poetic, garrulous accuracy. And once you've attuned yourself to the epistemological vaudeville of Beckett's prose, he turns out to be the funniest writer on the planet--ever.<p> None of the three entries in the trilogy is exactly amenable to summary. It's fair to say, though, that <i>Molloy</i> is the easiest to read, with at least a bare-bones narrative and an abundance of comical set pieces. In one famous episode, the narrator spends page after page figuring out how to vary the sucking stones he carries in his pockets: </p><blockquote> And while I gazed thus at my stones, revolving interminable martingales all equally defective, and crushing handfuls of sand, so that the sand ran through my fingers and fell back on the strand, yes, while thus I lulled my mind and part of my body, one day suddenly it dawned on the former, dimly, that I might perhaps achieve my purpose without increasing the number of my pockets, or reducing the number of my stones, but simply by sacrificing the principle of trim. The meaning of this illumination, which suddenly began to sing within me, like a verse of Isaiah, or of Jeremiah, I did not penetrate at once, and notably the word trim, which I had never met with, in this sense, long remained obscure. </blockquote> This nutty ratiocination goes on for much, much longer, until the narrator loses patience and throws the stones away. And that's a fair encapsulation of Beckett's philosophy: he argues for the essential pointlessness of life--the solitary, wretched splendor of human existence--but does so in a comic rather than a tragic register, which ends up softening or even overpowering the bleakness of his initial premise. So <i>Malone Dies</i> opens with a typically morbid mood-lifter ("I shall soon be quite dead at last in spite of it all") and then makes endless comedic hay out of Malone's failure to keel over. And by the time we hit <i>The Unnamable</i>, we're forced to wonder whether the narrator actually exists: "I, say I. Unbelieving. Questions, hypotheses, call them that. Keep going, going on, call that going, call that on." Happily, Beckett worried these same questions and hypotheses to the end of his career, with increasingly minimalistic gusto. But he never topped the intensity or linguistic brilliance of this mind-bending three-part invention. <i>--James Marcus</i>Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin in 1906 and died in 1989. A playwright and novelist, he studied and taught in Paris and eventually settled there permanently. He wrote primarily in French, frequently translating his works into English himself. His novels include <b>Watt</b>; the trilogy <b>Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnamable</b>; <b>How It Is</b>; and<b><i> </i>The Lost Ones</b>. In his theater of the absurd, Beckett combined poignant humor with an overwhelming sense of anguish and loss.

Too much protein is actually making us sick, fat, and tired, according to Dr. Davis. If you are getting adequate calories in your diet, there is no such thing as protein deficiency.

In his more usual state&#x2014;rushing from one meeting to the next, compact shoulders hunched low over his diminutive body&#x2014;he was an ambition-fueled bullet train emancipated from its tracks, a frantic dervish of arms and legs.<br> <br>Bursting out into the covered rear security entrance of his company&#x2019;s headquarters, a renovated nineteenth-century mansion situated halfway down a tree-lined private road in an upscale section of Moscow, every molecule beneath Berezovsky&#x2019;s skin seemed to vibrate, as one hand straightened his suit jacket over his pressed white shirt, while his pinpoint eyes navigated the few feet that separated him from his waiting limousine. As usual, the gleaming Mercedes-Benz 600 was parked as close to the door as possible, so that the overhanging concrete eaves provided ample cover. If that wasn&#x2019;t enough, there was also the hulking bodyguard standing beside the open rear door of the automobile, as well as the driver, nodding through the reinforced front windshield.<br> <br>The car was already running. Berezovsky was a businessman, and in Russia in the mid-1990s, it wasn&#x2019;t good business for a man in his position to spend more time than necessary going between office and car. Even here, on his home turf, behind the pre-Revolution manor that he&#x2019;d painstakingly restored to a state of opulence&#x2014;lavish interior filled with expensive furniture, impeccably dressed attendants, even an oversize aquarium running along one wall&#x2014;he had to be cautious.<br> <br>He kept his gaze low as he hurried toward the car. The covered security entrance was designed to ensure the privacy of those who most needed it; since the entrance was essentially enclosed, it would be impossible for a stray passerby to stroll close enough to see anything. But even if somehow someone had wandered inside the security entrance in time to watch Berezovsky give an officious wink toward the bodyguard and slide his minute form into the backseat of the Mercedes, the pedestrian would have known to look away quickly. Berezovsky wasn&#x2019;t particularly famous, but he emanated power&#x2014;from his expensive suit to his frenetic pace. Those who did recognize him might have described him as an entrepreneur. They might have called him a vastly successful car salesman, or a former academic who had turned to finance. All of these things were true&#x2014;and all of them were laughably insufficient. Even those who knew him well could only hope to scrape the surface of what he was&#x2014;and the heights toward which his ambition was driving him.<br> <br>Safely ensconced in the interior of the car, Berezovsky waited for the bodyguard to join the driver up front. Then the car immediately started forward.<br> <br>Berezovsky tried to relax as the Mercedes navigated away from the curb and entered the sparse, late-afternoon traffic. It was hard for him to believe it was only Tuesday. It had been a long week already. The past forty-eight hours had been filled with meetings, mostly with executives from AvtoVAZ&#x2014;Russia&#x2019;s largest car maker, known mostly for its signature automobile, the boxy, functional Lada, affectionately dubbed &#x201c;the people&#x2019;s car&#x201d;&#x2014;and with Berezovsky&#x2019;s underlings at LogoVAZ. He&#x2019;d formed the company five years ago, originally to supply AvtoVAZ&#x2019;s computer software, but it had evolved into Russia&#x2019;s largest Lada dealership, with showrooms all over the country. Those forty-eight hours had been full of banal conversations, only made bearable by the sumptuousness of the setting, his Logovaz Club. No matter how busy things got, Berezovsky often made sure that the last appointment of each day took place in the private apartment he kept on the top floor of his headquarters, where a stunning, young girlfriend might keep his top shelf vodka poured and waiting.<br> <br>Though the meetings had dragged on, and as tedious as the subject matter had been, it was the time between each assignation that Berezovsky hated most. That was why most of his business took place at the club, where he could quickly pirouette between appointments, losing mere seconds in transit. Going off-site meant dealing with the necessary delays of the outside world&#x2014;traffic, physical distance, the whims and inefficiencies of other people&#x2019;s schedules. It wasn&#x2019;t just Berezovsky&#x2019;s internal wiring that made him miserable at the thought of wasted minutes&#x2014;the fact that he couldn&#x2019;t sit still, even with his back against the most luxurious leather that Mercedes could manufacture&#x2014;it was the knowledge of how valuable every lost minute could be. To him, the Breguet on his wrist didn&#x2019;t measure time; it kept track of lost opportunities.<br> <br>Berezovsky was well aware that this impatience was yet another symptom of the seismic shift that had engulfed his world, beginning less than a decade earlier. Impatience, ambition, the ability to dream big and live even bigger&#x2014;none of these things had mattered in the Russia of his childhood. The best a young, mathematically gifted Jewish kid from Moscow, with no connections among the Communist elite and no knowledge of the outside world, could have hoped for was a doctorate in mathematics from one of the few universities that accepted the less desirable ethnicities. No matter how many awards he&#x2019;d gone on to win, or papers he&#x2019;d published, he&#x2019;d been heading toward a simple, quiet life of books and laboratories.<br> <br>And then&#x2014;Perestroika, the lightning bolt that had shattered everything. First, the old world fell in fits and bouts to Gorbachev and, rising parallel to him, Yeltsin. Then a chaotic new world haphazardly emerged, buoyed by an infant form of capitalism that was just now reaching its chaotic teenage years.<br> <br>Suddenly a man who was good with numbers, could think theoretically and far enough ahead not to get bogged down in the absurdities of the nearly lawless moment&#x2014;and light enough on his feet to dance over the inevitable aftershocks of a science-fiction-level restructuring of an entire nation from the ground up&#x2014;suddenly, such a man had a chance at a brand-new future. Being different, being an outsider, the very qualities that had impeded success in a world built behind walls, were a form of insulation when those walls came crashing down.<br> <br>Berezovsky hadn&#x2019;t wasted a moment wondering what would come next. He&#x2019;d turned his attention toward a world where money suddenly had meaning. That, in turn, had led him to what he earnestly believed to be the holiest relic of this new, free, capitalist system his country hoped to become.<br> <br>Berezovsky grinned as he ran his gaze over the parked cars flashing by on either side of his limousine. Aside from the odd foreign model&#x2014;mostly German, like his Mercedes, or almost as frequently Japanese, Toyotas and Hondas&#x2014;the majority of the cars they passed were Ladas. Squat, compact, rugged, and without a hint of glamour or wasted expense, each Lada represented the culmination of a previously unimaginable dream. Perestroika or not, a Muscovite didn&#x2019;t simply wake up after 1991 with a pile of rubles under his bed, ready to stroll to the nearest car dealership.<br> <br>In truth, the Lada had become the first symbol of the new, free Russia. Owning a Lada was everything, and to get one a person needed more than money. You also needed knowledge of the right person to bribe.<br> <br>Berezovsky hadn&#x2019;t set his sights on owning a Lada; he&#x2019;d set his sights on the company that made them. Initially, he&#x2019;d worked with the skill set he&#x2019;d acquired in his academic life; he&#x2019;d founded LogoVAZ as a computer software company aimed at solving numerical payment issues for the newly accountable auto conglomerate.<br> <br>Working his way deeper into the sprawling corporate behemoth, he&#x2019;d quickly realized that the men who&#x2019;d been placed in charge of AvtoVAZ were functionaries of the old world: dinosaurs who didn&#x2019;t understand the economic changes exploding around them. These Red Directors, as the history books would eventually label them, had been handed the reins of major companies across every industry by a government that itself hardly understood the capitalist world that perestroika had unleashed.<br> <br>In the back of the Mercedes, Berezovsky&#x2019;s attention settled on a pair of Ladas parked next to each other in the driveway of a two-story office supply company a few buildings down from his headquarters. He could envision it all in his head, the journey those automobiles had taken to get into that driveway. Birthed on an assembly line in the vast manufacturing plant on the banks of the Volga river, then a lengthy trek via barge and truck to the urban centers where the buying public lived; on to guarded dealer lots, where the cars would be briefly stored before finding their way into a showroom. And then the final transaction itself, rubles changing hands, usually through a &#x201c;connected&#x201d; middleman&#x2014;along with a silent prayer that the seeds of cash would somehow bear automotive fruit.<br> <br>So much distance traveled, so much time wasted: but in this situation, Berezovsky had realized, they weren&#x2019;t simply minutes to be mourned. These were minutes to be utilized. The Americans had a saying, born of capitalism: time is money. Berezovsky had made his first fortune off the literal application of that clich�.<br> <br>Berezovsky&#x2019;s Mercedes slipped past the driveway and the pair of Ladas, then worked its way by another row of parked cars&#x2014;a Toyota, a handful of older AvtoVAZ models, then a dust-covered German-made Opel, squatting directly in front of a curbside fruit stand. Berezovsky didn&#x2019;t spend a lot of time thinking about his past, but it still gave him pleasure to remember the scheme that had first put him on the map. It wasn&#x2019;t something he would have talked about in an interview, nor was it something an interviewer would ever have dared ask him about. Even so, he was quite proud of the simple elegance of his first real venture.<br> <br>Manufacturing line to consumer, an incredible journey of miles and minutes: these had been the perfect ingredients for an epic level of arbitrage. In the free-fall economy of Russia&#x2019;s teenage capitalism, time was usually considered an enemy to money. Double- and triple-digit inflation had turned every ruble into a rapidly leaking balloon, shrinking by the second. But Berezovsky had been able to turn this enemy to his advantage. He had come up with a scheme to take a large number of cars on consignment, paying the Red Directors only a nominal down payment, which, for the most part, they had happily pocketed. Then Berezovsky sold the cars through his various dealerships. After that, he&#x2019;d wait months&#x2014;or even years&#x2014;to make good on the balance of what he owed AvtoVAZ, letting inflation do its work. By the time he&#x2019;d paid off his debt, he was putting down kopecks on the ruble. In short order, Logovaz was earning more than six hundred percent profit on every car it sold.<br> <br>And that had only been the beginning. Berezovsky had built on his reputation as the premier Lada dealer to open a banking fund to pre-order even more cars. He&#x2019;d raised almost sixty million dollars toward that end&#x2014;money he was in no rush to turn over to AvtoVAZ, or anyone else.<br> <br>Perhaps the most incredible thing about his venture was that none of what he was doing was technically illegal. It was simply arbitrage, a mathematical and ambitious mind taking advantage of an inefficiency in an existing market. Of course, the fact that Berezovsky hadn&#x2019;t broken any explicit laws didn&#x2019;t mean he hadn&#x2019;t ruffled any feathers. The car business, like every other business in modern Russia, existed in a chaotic vacuum many people liked to call the Wild East. Where there was money to be made, there were often men with guns involved. Almost daily, the Russian newspapers had reported stories of businessmen murdered because of deals gone bad.<br> <br>To Berezovsky, the dangerous elements on the fringes of the business world were simply an unfortunate cost of this new, free market. Successful corporations adapted, dedicating resources to defend themselves against what they called &#x201c;wet work,&#x201d; perhaps an overly graphic term for the assassination trade, borrowed from the world of organized crime. Rumor was, Logovaz had outsourced its wet work to a team of &#x201c;specialists&#x201d;&#x2014;a murky association about which Berezovsky wanted to know as little as possible. Even so, his dealerships had not been immune to the violence. A few of his showrooms had even been shot up over the past few weeks, though nobody had been killed. Even more frightening, a known member of a powerful Russian gangland outfit had recently approached Berezovsky himself, demanding the resolution of some unimportant difference of opinion. Berezovsky had essentially waved the man away&#x2014;and, a few days later, there had been a pitched gun battle outside one of his regional Lada showrooms. A half dozen unclaimed Chechen and Russian bodies were carted off by the local police.<br> <br>Bulletproof limousines, high-priced bodyguards, paid mercenaries: business as usual under perestroika. Unpleasant but necessary, and the furthest thing from Berezovsky&#x2019;s thoughts as he watched the parked cars flashing by. His mind shifted ahead to the dinner he was about to attend; more deals to be made, more rubles to be mined out of minutes. After dinner, he would take the short ride back to his club&#x2014;and maybe arrange a visit to the upstairs apartment. As his Mercedes moved alongside the dust-covered Opel, he was imagining the smell of perfume, curves shifting beneath sheets. And then, entirely by accident, Berezovsky noticed something odd out of the corner of his vision. It might have been nothing at all&#x2014;maybe a trick of light against the bulletproof window to his left, or even a shadow from the high fruit stand that rose up behind the parked car. But he thought he saw a wisp of dark smoke coming out of the Opel&#x2019;s trunk.<br> <br>He opened his mouth to say something to his driver&#x2014;but before the words could come out, there was a sudden flash of light.<br> <br>And then the shock wave hit.<br> <br>The Mercedes was lifted three feet off the ground, tilting sickeningly in the air. The window to Berezovsky&#x2019;s left exploded inward, jagged shards of bulletproof glass pelting his face, neck, and shoulder. He felt a brief moment of weightlessness&#x2014;and then the limo crashed back to the ground, both axles snapping from the force. The sound came next, a howling roar loud enough to pop both his eardrums, hitting him like a fist against his skull, slamming him back against the warping leather seat.<br> <br>And then the heat. His eyes went wide as a ball of searing flame engulfed his entire world, bright orange licks of fire clawing at the exposed skin of his face, neck, and hands. He screamed, slapping at the pain, then found himself rolling forward, almost by instinct. The next thing he knew, his knees and hands hit pavement, and he was crawling through broken glass. A strange scent, acrid and sweet at the same time, filled his nostrils; he realized it was the scent of his own skin burning. He screamed again, lurching forward on the glass-covered road, away from the heat. Finally, he was able to lift himself to his feet.<br> <br>He turned back toward his car&#x2014;and stared at the burning, mangled mess of metal. It took him a full minute to understand what he was seeing; much of the chassis was melted right into the pavement, the windows were all blown out, the outer...</p><h2>Recipes For Life From God&#39;s Garden</h2><p>eating foods from the principle of the Bible</p><p></p><h2>Usborne Books Look Inside a Castle</h2><p>Lift the flaps to explore a busting medieval castle, and follow Lord Robert and Lady Margaret as they hold a feast, watch a tournement and fight off fearsome siege engines.</p><p></p><h2>Our Mathematical Universe</h2><p>In Our Mathematical Universe, Max Tegmark, one of the most original physicists at work today, leads us on an astonishing journey to explore the mysteries uncovered by cosmology and to discover the nature of reality Part-history of the cosmos, part-intellectual adventure, Our Mathematical Universe travels from the Big Bang to the distant future via parallel worlds, across every possible scale - from the sub-atomic to the intergalactic - showing how mathematics provides the answers to our questions about the world.

My suitcase!&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>They were already boarding my flight from Boston to Philadelphia,<br>where I was supposed to help with a BBC documentary about Hugh Everett, when I realized that my hand wasn&#x2019;t holding a suitcase. I ran back to the security checkpoint.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Did someone just forget a black roll-on bag here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said the guard. <br>&#x201c;But there it is&#x2014;that&#x2019;s my suitcase, right there!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a black suitcase,&#x201d; said the guard. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a teal suitcase.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Until then, I&#x2019;d never realized how color-blind I was, and it was quite<br>humbling to realize that many assumptions I&#x2019;d previously made about reality&#x2014;and my wardrobe&#x2014;were dead wrong. How could I ever trust what my senses told me about the outside world? And if I couldn&#x2019;t, then how could I hope to ever know anything with certainty about the external reality? After all, everything I know about the outside world and my untrustworthy senses, I&#x2019;ve learned from my senses. This puts me on the same shaky epistemological footing as a prisoner who&#x2019;s spent his whole life in solitary confinement, whose only information about the outside world and his untrustworthy prison guard is what his prison guard has told him. More generally, how can I trust what my conscious perceptions tell me about the world if I don&#x2019;t understand how my mind works?<br>&nbsp;<br>This basic dilemma has been eloquently explored by philosophers throughout the ages, including titans such as Plato, Ren� Descartes, David Hume and Immanuel Kant. Socrates said: &#x201c;The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.&#x201d; So how can we make further progress in our quest to understand reality?<br>&nbsp;<br>So far in this book, we&#x2019;ve taken a physics approach to exploring our external physical reality, zooming out to the transgalactic macrocosm and zooming in to the subatomic microcosm, attempting to understand things in terms of their basic building blocks such as elementary particles. However, all we have direct knowledge of are instead qualia, the basic building blocks of our conscious perception,* (* For introductions to the vast literature on consciousness by psychologists, neuroscientists, philosophers and others, I recommend the books about the mind in the &#x201c;Suggestions for Further Reading&#x201d; section.) exemplified by the redness of a rose, the sound of a cymbal, the smell of a steak, the taste of a tangerine or the pain of a pinprick. So don&#x2019;t we also need to understand consciousness before we can fully understand physics? I used to answer &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; thinking that we could never figure out the elusive &#x201c;theory of everything&#x201d; for our external physical reality without first understanding the distorting mental lens through which we perceive it. But I&#x2019;ve changed my mind, and in this brief interlude chapter, I want to tell you why.<br>&nbsp;<br>External Reality and Internal Reality<br>&nbsp;<br>Perhaps you&#x2019;re thinking, Okay, Max, but I&#x2019;m not color-blind. And I&#x2019;m looking at the external reality right now with my own eyes, and I&#x2019;d have to be paranoid to think it&#x2019;s not the way it looks. But please try these simple experiments:<br>&nbsp;<br>Experiment 1: Turn your head from left to right a few times. Experiment 2: Move your eyes from left to right a few times, without moving your head.<br>&nbsp;<br>Did you notice how the first time, the external reality appeared to rotate, and the second time, it appeared to stay still, even though your eyeballs rotated both times? This proves that what your mind&#x2019;s eye is looking at isn&#x2019;t the external reality, but a reality model stored in your brain! If you looked at the image recorded by a rotating video camera, you&#x2019;d clearly see it move as it did in Experiment 1. But your eyes are a form of biological video camera, so Experiment 2 shows that your consciousness isn&#x2019;t directly perceiving the images formed on their retinas. Rather, as neuroscientists have now studied in great detail, the information recorded by your retinas gets processed in highly complex ways and is used to continually update an elaborate model of the outside world that&#x2019;s stored in your brain. Take another look in front of you, and you&#x2019;ll see that, thanks to this advanced information processing, your reality model is three-dimensional even though the raw images from your retinas are two-dimensional.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#x2019;t have a light switch near my bed, so I&#x2019;ll often take a good look at my bedroom and all the obstacles littering the floor, then turn off the light and walk to my bed. Try it yourself: put down this book, stand up, look around, and then walk a few steps with your eyes closed. Can you &#x201c;see&#x201d;/&#x201d;feel&#x201d; the objects in the room moving relative to you? That&#x2019;s your reality model being updated, this time using information from your leg movements rather than from your eyes. Your brain continuously updates its reality model using any useful information it can get hold of, including sound, touch, smell and taste.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let&#x2019;s call this reality model your internal reality, because it&#x2019;s the way you subjectively perceive the external reality from the internal vantage point of your mind. This reality is internal also in the sense that it exists only internally to you: your mind feels as if it&#x2019;s looking at the outside world, while it&#x2019;s actually looking only at a reality model inside your head&#x2014;which in turn is continually tracking what&#x2019;s outside your brain via elaborate but automatic processes that you&#x2019;re not consciously aware of.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s absolutely crucial that we don&#x2019;t conflate this internal reality with the external reality that it&#x2019;s tracking, because the two are very different. My brain&#x2019;s internal reality is like the dashboard of my car: a convenient summary of the most useful information. Just as my car&#x2019;s dashboard tells me my speed, fuel level, motor temperature, and other things useful for a driver to be aware of, my brain&#x2019;s dashboard/reality model tells me my speed and position, my hunger level, the air temperature, highlights of my surroundings and other things useful for the operator of a human body to be aware of.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth<br>&nbsp;<br>Once my car&#x2019;s dashboard malfunctioned and sent me to the garage with its &#x201c;CHECK ENGINE&#x201d; indicator illuminated even though nothing was wrong. Similarly, there are many ways in which a person&#x2019;s reality model can malfunction and differ from the true external reality, giving rise to illusions (incorrect perceptions of things that do exist in the external reality), omissions (nonperception of things that do exist in the external reality) and hallucinations (perceptions of things that don&#x2019;t exist in the external reality). If we swear under oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, we should be aware that our perceptions might violate all three with illusions, omissions and hallucinations, respectively.<br>&nbsp;<br>So metaphorically speaking, the &#x201c;CHECK ENGINE&#x201d; incident was my car hallucinating&#x2014;or experiencing phantom pain. I recently discovered that my car also suffers from an illusion: based on its speedometer reading, it thinks it&#x2019;s always driving two miles per hour faster than it really is. That&#x2019;s not bad compared to the vast list of human illusions that cognitive scientists have discovered, which afflict all our senses and distort our internal reality. If your version of this figure is in color rather than black and white, you&#x2019;ll probably see the lower dot in the left panel as orange and the upper dot as somewhat brown. Figure 9.1 (in the book) shows two examples of optical illusions, where our visual system creates an internal reality different from the external reality. In the external reality, the light from both of them has identical properties, with a wavelength around 600 nanometers. If a spotlight beamed out such light, it would be orange light. What about brown? Have you ever seen a spotlight or a laser pointer produce a brown beam? Well, you never will, because there&#x2019;s no such thing as brown light! The color brown doesn&#x2019;t exist in the external reality, but only in your internal reality: it&#x2019;s simply what you perceive when seeing dim orange light against a darker background.<br>&nbsp;<br>For fun, I sometimes compare how the same news story is reported online by MSNBC, FOX News, the BBC, Al Jazeera, Pravda and elsewhere. I find that when it comes to telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, it&#x2019;s the second part that accounts for most of the differences in how they portray reality: what they omit. I think the same holds for our senses: although they can produce hallucinations and illusions, it&#x2019;s their omissions that account for most of the discrepancy between the internal and external realities. My visual system omitted the information that distinguishes between black and teal suitcases, but even if you&#x2019;re not color-blind, you&#x2019;re missing out on the vast majority of the information that light carries. When I was taught in elementary school that all colors of light can be made up by mixing three primary colors red, green, and blue, I thought that this number three told us something fundamental about the external reality. But I was wrong: it teaches us only about the omissions of our visual system. Specifically, it tells us that our retina has three kinds of cone cells, which take the thousands of numbers that can be measured in a spectrum of light (see Figure 2.5 in Chapter 2) and keeps only three numbers, corresponding to the average light intensity across three broad ranges of wavelengths.<br>&nbsp;<br>Moreover, wavelengths of light outside of the narrow range 400&#x2013;700 nanometers go completely undetected by our visual system, and it came as quite a shock when human-built detectors revealed that our external reality was vastly richer than we&#x2019;d realized, teeming with radio waves, microwaves, x-rays, and gamma rays. And vision isn&#x2019;t the only one of our senses that&#x2019;s guilty of omissions: we can&#x2019;t hear the ultrasound chirping of mice, bats and dolphins; we&#x2019;re oblivious to most faint scents that dominate the olfactory inner reality of dogs, and so on. Although some animal species capture more visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory or other sensory information than we humans do, they&#x2019;re all unaware of the sub-atomic realm, the galaxy-spangled cosmos, and the dark energy and dark matter that, as we saw in Chapter 4, makes up 96% of our external reality.<br>&nbsp;<br>Consensus Reality<br>&nbsp;<br>In the first two parts of this book, we&#x2019;ve seen how our physical world can be remarkably well described by mathematical equations, fueling the hope that one day equations can be found for a &#x201c;theory of everything,&#x201d; perfectly describing our external reality on all scales. The ultimate triumph of physics would be to start with the external reality from the &#x201c;bird perspective&#x201d; of a mathematician studying these equations (which are ideally simple enough to fit on her T-shirt) and to derive from them her internal reality, the way she subjectively perceives it from her &#x201c;frog perspective&#x201d; inside the external reality. To accomplish this would clearly require a detailed understanding of how consciousness works, including illusions, omissions, hallucinations and other complications.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, between the external reality and the internal reality, there&#x2019;s also a third and intermediate consensus reality, as illustrated in Figure 9.2 (in the book). This is the version of reality that we life-forms here on Earth all agree on: the 3-D positions and motions of macroscopic objects, and other everyday attributes of the world for which we have a shared description in terms of familiar concepts from classical physics. Table 9.1 summarizes these reality descriptions and perspectives and how they&#x2019;re interrelated.<br>&nbsp;<br>Each of us has our own personal inner reality, perceived from the subjective perspective of our own position, orientation and state of mind, and distorted by our personal cognitive biases: in your inner reality, dreams are real and the world turns upside down when you stand on your head. In contrast, the consensus reality is shared. When you give your friend driving directions to your place, you do your best to trans- form your description from one involving subjective concepts from your inner reality (such as &#x201c;here&#x201d; and &#x201c;in the direction I&#x2019;m facing&#x201d;) to shared concepts from the consensus reality (such as &#x201c;on 70 Vassar Street&#x201d; and &#x201c;north&#x201d;). Since we scientists need to be precise and quantitative when we refer to our shared consensus reality, we try extra-hard to be objective: we say that light has a &#x201c;600-nanometer wavelength&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;orange color&#x201d; and that something has &#x201c;CH3COOC5H11 molecules&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;banana flavor.&#x201d; The consensus reality isn&#x2019;t free from some shared illusions relative to the external reality, as we&#x2019;ll elaborate on below: for example, cats, bats and robots also experience the same quantum randomness and relativistic time dilation. However, it&#x2019;s by definition free from illusions that are unique to biological minds, and therefore decouples from the issue of how our human consciousness works. The internal reality may feel teal deficient to me, black and white to a seal, iridescent to a bird seeing four primary colors, and still more different to a bee seeing polarized light, a bat using sonar, a blind person with keener touch and hearing, or the latest robotic vacuum cleaner, but we all agree on whether the door is open.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is why I&#x2019;ve changed my mind: although understanding the detailed nature of human consciousness is a fascinating challenge in its own right, it&#x2019;s not necessary for a fundamental theory of physics, which need &#x201c;only&#x201d; derive the consensus reality from its equations. In other words, what Douglas Adams called &#x201c;the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything&#x201d; splits cleanly into two parts that can be tackled separately: the challenge for physics is deriving the consensus reality from the external reality, and the challenge for cognitive science is to derive the internal reality from the consensus reality. These are two great challenges for the third millennium.

Their abundance is both an indicator of ecological imbalance and a generous opportunity to connect with the animal world. CROW<i> </i>PLANET<i> </i>reminds us that we do not need to head to faraway places to encounter "nature." Rather, even in the suburbs and cities where we live we are surrounded by wild life such as crows, and through observing them we can enhance our appreciation of the world's natural order. CROW PLANET richly weaves Haupt's own "crow stories" as well as scientific and scholarly research and the history and mythology of crows, culminating in a book that is sure to make readers see the world around them in a very different way.</p><p>Lyanda Lynn Haupt has created and directed educational programs for Seattle Audubon, worked in raptor rehabilitation in Vermont, and as a seabird researcher for the Fish and Wildlife Service in the remote tropical Pacific. She is the author of <em>Pilgrim on the Great Bird Continent</em> and <em>Rare Encounters with Ordinary Birds</em> (winner of the 2002 Washington State Book Award). Her writing has appeared in <em>Image</em>, <em>Open Spaces</em>, <em>Wild Earth</em>, <em>Conservation Biology Journal</em>, <em>Birdwatcher's Digest</em>, and the <em>Prairie Naturalist</em>. She lives in West Seattle with her husband and daughter."A completely charming and informative book on the pleasures of keeping one's eyes open." (<b>David Sedaris</b>)<br><br>"In a lyrical narrative that blends science and conscience, Haupt mourns the encroachments of urbanization, but cherishes the wildness that survives." (<b><em>New York Times</em></b>)<br><br>"A personal book, one that uses [Haupt] and her fondness for crows to cast its interests toward large concepts such as conservation, the environment, and learning to live more thoughtfully."-<i>Seattle Times</i><br><br>"With her sensitivity, careful eye and gift for language, Haupt tells her tale beautifully...immersing us in a heady hybrid of science, history, how-to and memoir."-<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"If you live in a city and want to expand your awareness of the natural world, CROW PLANET would be a compelling and inspirational book. If you love or hate or are mystified by crows, it is an essential one."-<i>The Oregonian</i><br><br>"A delightful meditation on our role in the natural world...[Haupt] provides a rich context for exploring the relationship between humans and nature."-<i>Library Journal</i>, Starred review<br><br>"Haupt writes gracefully about the interactions between crows and humans in the urban landscape and what those interactions portend for the future of the zo�polis. A fresh take on conscious living in the everyday world." (<i><b>Kirkus Reviews</b></i>)<br><br>"Haupt enlivens her observations with tidbits from crow mythology and history [and] succeeds in humanizing the object of her naturalist obsession and affection."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><br>"If you picture Henry David Thoreau as a young mother and scientist in suburban Seattle, you can begin to imagine the literate elegance of<i> Crow Planet</i>. Lyanda Haupt has spun the natural life of neighborhoods, and most poignantly the surpassing intelligence of crows, into the kind of gold only the most gifted writer and naturalist could fashion.<i> Crow Planet</i> is a small treasure, a conversion experience of truth, wit, and re-enchantment that remakes the world and our place within it."--Paul Hawken, author of <em>Blessed Unrest</em> and <em>Natural Capitalism</em><br><br>"Haupt captures crows wonderfully in elegant prose and weaves a thoughtful tale that connects them from St. Benedict's philosophy of lecti divina of 480 CE to our growing awareness of our kinship to, and dependence on, the rest of life."--Bernd Heinrich, author of <em>Mind of the Raven</em></p><h2>The Grail Legend (English and German Edition)</h2><p><p>The Holy Grail and its quest is a legend that has had a powerful impact on our civilization and culture. The Grail itself is an ancient Celtic symbol of plenty as well as a Christian symbol of redemption and eternal life, the chalice that caught the blood of the crucified Christ. The story of the Grail sheds profound light on man's search for the supreme value of life, for that which makes life most meaningful.</p><p>Writing in a clear and readable style, two leading women of the Jungian school of psychology present this legend as a living myth that is profoundly relevant to modern life. We encounter such universal figures as the Fool (the naive young Perceval), the Wise Old Man (the Hermit Gornemanz), the Virgin Maiden (Blancheflor), the Loathly Damsel, and such important themes as the Waste Land, the Trinity, and the vessel of the Grail. Weaving together narrative and interpretation, the authors show us how the legend reflects not only fundamental human problems but also the dramatic psychic events that form the background of our Christian culture. Emma Jung--analyst, writer, and wife of the famous psychologist C. G. Jung--researched and worked on this book for thirty years, until her death in 1955. Marie-Louise von Franz, also eminent in the field of depth psychology, completed the project.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Grail Legend</i> is a beautifully sustained application of Jungian theory to a whole story rather than merely to isolated motifs or archetypes. The work is far better researched than many other Jungian studies, and is written with a spritely, charming touch. A delightful volume."<b>--Robert Segal, University of Lancaster, editor of <i>Jung on Mythology</i> and <i>The Gnostic Jung</i></b></p><b>Emma Jung</b>was a life-long student of Arthurian mythology, and the author of <i>Animus and Anima</i>. <b>Marie-Louise von Franz</b>, who passed away in 1998, made major contributions to Jungian analysis and the study of myth. Her many books include <i>Individuation in Fairy Tales, Number and Time,</i> and <i>Puer Aeternus.</i> She is also coauthor of <i>Man and His Symbols</i>.</p><h2>The Hitler of History</h2><p>In this brilliant, strikingly original book, historian John Lukacs delves to the core of Adolf Hitler's life and mind by examining him through the lenses of his surprisingly diverse biographers.<br><br>Since 1945 there have been more than one hundred biographies of Hitler, and countless other books on him and the Third Reich. What happens when so many people reinterpret the life of a single individual? Dangerously, the cumulative portrait that begins to emerge can suggest the face of a mythic antihero whose crimes and errors blur behind an aura of power and conquest. By reversing the process, by making Hitler's biographers--rather than Hitler himself--the subject of inquiry, Lukacs reveals the contradictions that take us back to the true Hitler of history.<br><br>Like an attorney, Lukacs puts the biographies on trial. He gives a masterly account of all the major works and of the personalities, methods, and careers of the biographers (one cannot separate the historian from his history, particularly in this arena); he looks at what is still not known (and probably never will be) about Hitler; he considers various crucial aspects of the real Hitler; and he shows how different biographers have either advanced our understanding or gone off track. By singling out those who have been involved in, or co-opted into, an implicit "rehabilitation&nbsp;&nbsp;of Hitler," Lukacs draws powerful conclusions about Hitler's essential differences from other monsters of history, such as Napoleon, Mussolini, and Stalin, and--equally important--about Hitler's place in the history of this century and of the world.</p><p>The horrible life and work of Adolf Hitler have long raised puzzling questions for historians: How could the putatively civilized German nation allow a leader to plunge it into murderous barbarism? Why did the rest of Europe not put a stop to Hitler&#39;s rise before Germany could amass imperial power? How did Hitler transform bourgeois anti-Semitism into the Holocaust? John Lukacs addresses these and many other questions in this book of essays on the many problems Hitler and his regime present to historians. He assesses the contemporary, too-abundant literature, and makes some surprising and controversial evaluations.John Lukacs was born in Hungary and came to the United States in 1946. Now emeritus, he has been a visiting professor at various universities. The recipient of the 1991 Ingersoll Prize, he is the author of eighteen other books. He and his wife live in Chester County, Pennsylvania.</p><h2>African Hunter (Peter Capstick&#39;s Library) (English and Swedish Edition)</h2><p>The author, former husband of the novelist Isak Dinesen, describes his years in Africa as a professional big-game hunter</p><p>Text: English, Swedish (translation)</p><h2>Tassajara Cooking</h2><p>TASSAJARA COOKING became an overnight classic when it was released in 1973. Ed Brown&#39;s recipes for cooking-for learning to appreciate all the steps involved in making a meal, from selecting the ingredients to serving the finished dish-struck a chord with people who care about food and nutrition. This groundbreaking book, in a completely redesigned format, is just as timely and relevant today, more than thirty years later. Brown discusses methods for working with vegetables, grains, beans, dairy products, and fruits; cooking techniques; and suggestions for planning good tasting, nutritious meals, from soups and salads to desserts. Generously seasoned with illustrations that detail every part of the cooking process, Tassajara Cooking is a comprehensive guide to inspired cooking, with joy.</p><p>Edward Espe Brown began cooking and practicing Zen in 1965. He was the first head resident cook at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center from 1967 to 1970. He later worked at the celebrated Greens Restaurant in San Francisco, serving as busboy, waiter, floor manager, wine buyer, cashier, host, and manager. Ordained a priest by Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, he has taught meditation retreats and vegetarian cooking classes throughout North America and Europe. He is the author of several cookbooks and the editor of <i>Not Always So</i>, a book of lectures by Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. He is the subject of the critically acclaimed 2007 film <i>How to Cook Your Life</i>."Rarely has a book of such simplicity underscored so well the joy of culinary discovery."&#x2014; <i>Bon Appetit </i></p><h2>The Two Minute Rule</h2><p>Devastated by the murder of his estranged police officer son on the day of his own release from prison, former bank robber Max Holman launches a renegade investigation and discovers that the chief suspect, a gang kingpin, is being deliberately and wrongfully targeted by the LAPD. By the author of The Forgotten Man. 200,000 first printing.</p><p>Robert Crais is the 2006 recipient of the Ross Macdonald Literary Award. He is the author of numerous New York Times bestsellers, including The Two Minute Rule, The Forgotten Man, and L.A. Requiem.Caught, convicted, and his time served, Max Holman is devastated by the news of his son's murder on his first day of freedom. His life "outside" begins, not as expected, but with a driving need to solve the riddles of false answers, the unrecovered fortune of a bank heist, and LAPD police corruption. Christopher Graybill maintains a steady hand on the intrigue that keeps listeners guessing throughout. His portraits of Holman and his unlikely partner, ex-FBI bank squad investigator Agent Pollard, are clear and subtly insightful. There's surprising humanity in these two misfits, and it comes across in Graybill's narration. Several minor characters get delightful "bit part" treatment from Graybill, making them more memorable than their brief appearances in the story.

These are women who can run a small business, keep a household with three kids in tiptop shape, and chair a church group all at the same time.

Yet, less than four years later, the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flew above the ruins of Berlin, stark symbol of a miraculous comeback that destroyed the German army and shattered Hitler's imperial designs. <br><br>Told in swift stirring prose, <i>When Titans Clashed</i> provides the first full account of this epic struggle from the Soviet perspective. David Glantz, one of the world's foremost authorities on the Soviet military, and Jonathan House present a fundamentally new interpretation of what the Russians called the "Great Patriotic War." Based on unprecedented access to formerly classified Soviet sources, they counter the German perspective that has dominated previous accounts and radically revise our understanding of the Soviet experience during World War II. <br><br>Placing the war within its wider political, economic, and social contexts, the authors recount how the determined Soviets overcame their initial disasters to defeat the most powerful army ever assembled. As they vividly show, this truly was war waged on a titanic scale, sweeping across a half-million square miles from Moscow to Berlin, featuring monumental offensives and counteroffensives, and ultimately costing both sides combined a staggering forty million casualties. <br><br>Their work offers new revelations on Soviet strategy and tactics, Stalin's role as supreme commander of the Red Army, the emergence of innovative and courageous commanders in the crucible of combat, numerous previously concealed or neglected military operations, German miscalculations on the road to the Red capital, the effect of D-Day and the "second front" on the Soviet effort, and the war's devastating impact on the Soviet economy and civilian population. <br><br>An essential volume for anyone interested in World War II or Soviet history, <i>When Titans Clashed</i> will change forever how we look at one of the greatest military confrontations in world history.</p><p>"<i>When Titans Clashed</i> represents by all and any reckoning a book whose time has come. The authors' clear and vigorous narrative leaves no doubt about the key decisions and the critical encounters in these massive engagements."--John Erickson, author of <i>The Road to Stalingrad</i> <p>"A compelling narrative of an epic conflict. No other work has answered with greater authority the lingering historical question--how did the Red Army defeat Nazi Germany?"--Von Hardesty, author of <i>Red Phoenix: The Rise of Soviet Air Power, 1941-1945</i> </p><p>"Exceptionally authoritative and exceptionally readable. The cogent assessments of Red Army commanders are not to be missed."--Russell F. Weigley, author of <i>The American Way of War</i> </p><p>"Certain to become the standard reference on the most important campaign of the Second World War."--Richard R. Muller, author of <i>The German Air War in Russia</i> </p><p>"Corrects longstanding misconceptions and puts a human 'face' on the 'faceless' Soviet army."--O. A.

For any lover, letter writing is an act of urgency: for the lesbian lover, it has often been an act of necessity.<br>Collected here for the first time is a sampling of poignantly revealing and often breathlessly passionate love letters between women, written over the past 140 years, including intimate musings by such famous writers as Virginia Woolf, Emily Dickinson, and tatiana de la tierra. Illustrated with more than sixty full-color collages, Between Us is a landmark work, shedding light on lesbian love with candor, humor, and grace.</p><p>This book is a beautiful object, a size held easily in the hand, with graphics and illustrations as telling as the words, exactly what the discerning book buyer has come to expect from Chronicle Books. Folklorist and vocalist for the now defunct band, Girls in the Nose, Kay Turner brings her smarts to this collection of missives from mostly not famous, but some very famous indeed, lesbians to their paramours. Turner introduces these <i>billets-doux</i> with an essay on the visibleness or hiddenness of the languages lesbians use with one another. This book would be a great gift to buy for a girlfriend or a girlfriend-you-hope-to-be.This brief, attractively produced volume is made up of love letters written by women to women over the past 150 years and dozens of collages by Turner and artist Sheri Tornatore. The letters are variously beautiful, banal, funny, angry, illiterate, arousing, explicit and coded. Though the bulk of them are from the 1980s and '90s written by and to unfamous lesbians, there is also the occasional letter to or from known names. Every one of the 62 letters offers something of interest, yet all are hampered by an almost complete lack of context. Notes about each letter and its correspondents are included at the back of the book; instead, they would have been far more useful at the foot of each page. Thus, some readers may miss the fact that a charming and ingratiating letter was written by the usually bullish Gertrude Stein to her longtime lover, Alice B. Toklas. Although the book's somewhat cluttered if imaginative design and organization hamper its potential effect, the end result is nevertheless a worthy volume. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Trieste</h2><p>Haya Tedeschi sits alone in Gorizia, in northeastern Italy, surrounded by a basket of photographs and newspaper clippings.

In the winter, my mother had to force me to go outside and play. I wanted to stay inside and read. Hey, it was COLD outside. In the summer, I would play on the swings or in the haymow with my friend, Jackie Bonniwell. But most of the time, I'd lie on a blanket under the oak tree in the front yard and read.</p> <p>My favorite books were the Betsy Tacy series by Maud Hart Lovelace. (Look for them in your bookstore or library. They're available in paperback, too.)</p> <p>I liked&nbsp;the Betsy Tacy books&nbsp;because they were about three friends&#x2014;Betsy, Tacy, and Tib&#x2014;and all they fun they had together.</p> <p>I had two best friends in grade school. Their names were Sharon and Elaine. They're both still my friends. Sharon and I would play paper dolls and make up stories for hours. And we would put on shows where we would sing and dance for our parents. I directed the shows. Sharon says I never let her sing. That was because she couldn't sing.

Written in a simple yet varied style, this book may be compared to Sondra Henry &amp; Emily Taitz's Everyone Wears His Name: A Biography of Levi Strauss , (Dillon, 1990). Unlike that book, which offers a colorful, original cover and many photo reproductions, this book is illustrated with a few muted drawings that lend a folktale quality. Also, it's possible that the combination of illustrations and subtitles may lead readers to confuse fact with fiction. Mr. Blue Jeans focuses on important biographical facts about Strauss, and includes details of special interest to children, omitting the extensive historical background information found in Henry &amp; Taitz's book. Because Weidt's book lacks an index, it will offer minimal help to researchers. --Phyllis Graves, Creekwood Middle School, Kingwood, TX<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>FoxTrotius Maximus: A FoxTrot Treasury (Volume 29)</h2><p>If they would have sold <i>FoxTrotius Maximus</i> at the Colosseum the gladiators could have taken the day off.

Now, for the first time, he tells the story of his life, from his turbulent childhood to the North Carolina Tar Heels&#x2019; 2009 national championship season.&nbsp; <br><br>With unbridled honesty, Williams recounts his rough early years in the mountains of Western North Carolina. During the troubled times of his adolescence, Roy&#x2019;s escape was a basketball court&#x2014;whether it was a neighbor's dirt court or the local school gym where he&#x2019;d shoot for hours at night. There was nowhere else to go, but as it turned out, no place he&#x2019;d rather be. The first in his family to go to college, Williams wound up at the University of North Carolina with the dream of becoming a coach and learning under the celebrated Dean Smith. <br>He also recalls his long tenure as head coach at the University of Kansas and his two heart-wrenching decisions&#x2014;to stay in Kansas at the program he built, and later, to return to UNC, to the one that built him&#x2014;and the accusations that followed both.&nbsp; <br><br>Williams' autobiography lays plain how he recruits, teaches, and motivates his players, and how he&#x2019;s shepherded teams through some of the most nail-biting games at both Kansas and UNC. His approach helped earn him the third-highest winning percentage in NCAA history: better than Mike Krzyzewski, Bobby Knight, and even John Wooden. So far, the Hall of Famer has coached in seven Final Fours, winning two NCAA championships in the last five seasons. <br><br>In <i>Hard Work</i>, Williams reveals the determination that took him from the humblest of beginnings to the pinnacle of coaching success, sharing his story because he believes that anyone can be inspired by its message: hard work really can make dreams come true.<br></p><p>ROY WILLIAMS head coach of the University of North Carolina mens basketball team, the Tar Heels, has the highest winning percentage in NCAA history. Over the last seven years, the 58-year-old Asheville, N.C., native&#x2014;who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2007&#x2014;has won 205 games, including 24 in the NCAA Tournament. Thats more Final Fours, more wins, and more NCAA Tournament victories than any basketball coach in the nation.This memoir of University of North Carolina coach Roy Williams is far more than a basketball book. He traces his story from the poverty of his youth to the pinnacle of collegiate success, multiple NCAA basketball championships. The story is classic Southern Appalachian storytelling, reminiscent of the work of Rick Bragg. To satisfy the basketball fans, there&#39;s lots of inside material on stars such as Michael Jordan. And the author&#39;s self-examination includes some of his shortcomings. Alan Winter narrates with enough of a drawl to make the account realistic but not so much that it makes understanding difficult. His pacing is easygoing and his tone is conversational, a style that makes the book speed along surprisingly quickly. R.C.G.

A wanted man in England, he is driven to fight as a mercenary archer in France, where he finds two things he can love: his instincts as a fighting man, and a girl in trouble. Together they survive the notorious massacre at Soissons, an event that shocks all Christendom. With no options left, Hook heads home to England, where his capture means certain death. Instead he is discovered by the young King of England--Henry V himself--and by royal command he takes up the longbow again and dons the cross of Saint George. Hook returns to France as part of the superb army Henry leads in his quest to claim the French crown. But after the English campaign suffers devastating early losses, it becomes clear that Hook and his fellow archers are their king's last resort in a desperate fight against an enemy more daunting than they could ever have imagined. </p> <p> One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare in <i>Henry V</i>--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands. Here Bernard Cornwell resurrects the legend of the battle and the "band of brothers" who fought it on October 25, 1415. An epic of redemption, <i>Agincourt</i> follows a commoner, a king, and a nation's entire army on an improbable mission to test the will of God and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. From the disasters at the siege of Harfleur to the horrors of the field of Agincourt, this exhilarating story of survival and slaughter is at once a brilliant work of history and a triumph of imagination&#x2014;Bernard Cornwell at his best. </p> <p> <strong> Historical Notes on <i>Agincourt</i> by Bernard Cornwell</strong> </p> <p> </p><p>The battle of Agincourt (Azincourt was and remains the French spelling) was one of the most remarkable events of medieval Europe, a battle whose reputation far outranked its importance. In the long history of Anglo-French rivalry only Hastings, Waterloo, Trafalgar, and Cr�cy share Agincourt&#x2019;s renown. It is arguable that Poitiers was a more significant battle and an even more complete victory, or that Verneuil was just as astonishing a triumph, and it&#x2019;s certain that Hastings, Blenheim, Victoria, Trafalgar, and Waterloo were more influential on the course of history, yet Agincourt still holds its extraordinary place in English legend. Something quite remarkable happened on 25 October 1415 (Agincourt was fought long before Christendom&#x2019;s conversion to the new-style calendar, so the modern anniversary should be on 4 November). It was something so remarkable that its fame persists almost six hundred years later.</p> <p>Agincourt&#x2019;s fame could just be an accident, a quirk of history reinforced by Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius, but the evidence suggests it really was a battle that sent a shock wave through Europe. For years afterward the French called 25 October 1415 <i>la malheureuse journ�e</i> (the unfortunate day). Even after they had expelled the English from France they remembered la malheureuse journ�e with sadness. It had been a disaster.</p> <p>Yet it was so nearly a disaster for Henry V and his small, but well-equipped army. That army had sailed from Southampton Water with high hopes, the chief of which was the swift capture of Harfleur, which would be followed by a foray into the French heartland in hope, presumably, of bringing the French to battle. A victory in that battle would demonstrate, at least in the pious Henry&#x2019;s mind, God&#x2019;s support of his claim to the French throne, and might even propel him onto that throne. Such hopes were not vain when his army was intact, but the siege of Harfleur took much longer than expected and Henry&#x2019;s army was almost ruined by dysentery.</p> <p>The tale of the siege in the novel is, by and large, accurate, though I did take one great liberty, which was to sink a mineshaft opposite the Leure Gate. There was no such shaft, the ground would not allow it, and all the real mines were dug by the Duke of Clarence&#x2019;s forces that were assailing the eastern side of Harfleur. The French counter-mines defeated those diggings, but I wanted to give a flavor, however inadequately, of the horrors men faced in fighting beneath the earth. The defense of Harfleur was magnificent, for which much of the praise must go to Raoul de Gaucourt, one of the garrison&#x2019;s leaders. His defiance, and the long days of the siege, gave the French a chance to raise a much larger army than any they might have fielded against Henry if the siege had ended, say, in early September.</p> <p><b>Maps of the Battlefield (Click to Enlarge)</b></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td></tr> <tr> <td>England and France, 1415:<br>One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare in <i>Henry V</i>--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>The French Coast:<br>The British campaign, which started at Harfleur, ended more than two months later on 25 October at Agincourt.</td> <td>Harfleur:<br>Henry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415 and besieged the port of Harfleur.</td> <td>The Battle Lines:<br>&#x201c;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.&#x201d; &#x2013; William Shakespeare, <i>Henry V</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p></p>A brutal and visceral tour through the medieval world, where life is balanced on the point of an arrow, and where war is fought with every bit of sinew in one's body. . . .

His first book, the masterful <i>New New Orleans Cooking</i>, began the relationship. In <i>Louisiana Real and Rustic</i>, Emeril has turned it into a full-blown affair. Along with coauthor Marcelle Bienvenu, Emeril set out across the state in search of that "culinary state of grace" Lousianans seemed to be naturally blessed with. The result is 150 recipes that serve at once as cultural history, geography lesson, and some mighty fine eating. This is a roots cookbook through and through, and the first lesson to learn is that in Louisiana, the roots run deep. Acadian, Creole, north Louisiana, south Louisiana, Bayou, country, city--each figures into the mix, and Emeril explores them all. He shows you gumbos that can be made with a French roux, African okra, or a fil� from the indigenous Indians. There are famous Meat Pies from Natchitoches, Louisiana; Creole dishes like Catfish Pecan Meuniere; and classic �touff�es, jambalayas, and fricassees--the one-pot meals that are the heart of Acadian (a.k.a. Cajun) cooking. The opening sections on the "Garde Manger" (food safe) and "Sauces" (try the recipe for homemade Worcestershire sauce) are indispensable for anybody even remotely interested in the food of Louisiana. More importantly, Emeril understands that food is another part of history, the people, and their culture--and in Louisiana, they eat well. <i>--Mark O.

Agatha Christie died on 12 January 1976, having become the best-selling novelist in history. Her autobiography, published in 1977 a year after her death, tells of her fascinating private life, from early childhood through two marriages and two World Wars, and her experiences both as a writer and on archaeological expeditions with her second husband, Max Mallowan. Not only does the book reveal the true genius of her legendary success, but the story is vividly told and as captivating as one of her novels.</p><p><p>Millions of fans the world over got to know her beloved characters, Hercule Poirot, Miss Jane Marple, and the rest, yet for decades little was known about their creator. Dame Agatha Christie was a woman who scrupulously kept her private life hidden from view, dodging the press, granting no interviews, and even, for a brief time, famously disappearing. But shortly after the great lady's death, the silence was broken when <em>An Autobiography</em> was finally published.</p><p>The witty, insightful, and immensely entertaining reflections of a marvelous talent, <em>An Autobiography</em> is as compulsively readable as Christie's novels. In her own inimitable style, a brilliant eccentric whose life encapsulated her times sheds light on her past, including her childhood in Victorian England, her volunteer work during World War II, and, of course, her phenomenal career. Agatha Christie's <em>An Autobiography</em> brings into sharp focus a beloved and enduring literary icon whose imagination continues to mesmerize readers to this very day.</p>Born in Torquay in 1890, Agatha Christie began writing during the First World War and wrote over 100 novels, plays and short story collections. She was still writing to great acclaim until her death, and her books have now sold over a billion copies in English and another billion in over 100 foreign languages. Yet Agatha Christie was always a very private person, and though Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple became household names, the Queen of Crime was a complete enigma to all but her closest friends.</p><h2>Coal River: A Powerful and Unforgettable Story of 20th Century Injustice</h2><p><b>In this vibrant new historical novel, the acclaimed author of&nbsp;<i>The Plum&nbsp;</i>Tree and&nbsp;<i>What She Left Behind&nbsp;</i>explores one young woman's determination to put an end to child labor in a Pennsylvania mining town. . .</b><br><br>As a child, Emma Malloy left isolated Coal River, Pennsylvania, vowing never to return.

They cornered him while he was walking home from school, harassed him because they thought he was gay, and poured a jug of gasoline on him. He escaped, but just barely. It wasn't the last time he would face death.<br>Three decades later, Moore is an award-winning writer, a leading Black Lives Matter activist, and an advocate for justice and liberation. In <i>No Ashes in the Fire</i>, he shares the journey taken by that scared, bullied teenager who not only survived, but found his calling. Moore's transcendence over the myriad forces of repression that faced him is a testament to the grace and care of the people who loved him, and to his hometown, Camden, NJ, scarred and ignored but brimming with life. Moore reminds us that liberation is possible if we commit ourselves to fighting for it, and if we dream and create futures where those who survive on society's edges can thrive.<i><br></i><i>No Ashes in the Fire</i> is a story of beauty and hope-and an honest reckoning with family, with place, and with what it means to be free.<br><b>Lambda Literary Award - Gay Memoir/Biography (Winner - 2019)</b><b>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year (2018)</b></p><p><b>Darnell L.

Reissue.</p><p>Based on 15 extended trips to the Canadian far north over a five-year period, <i>Arctic Dreams</i> celebrates the mysteries of what documentarians fondly call "last frontiers." Such places are everywhere in danger of destruction in the interest of ever-elusive economic progress, but Lopez writes no jeremiads. Instead, he aims to foster a kind of learned understanding of wild places, in this case the vast, scarcely knowable northern landscape. Writing of the natural history of the Arctic and its inhabitants--narwhals, polar bears, beluga whales, musk oxen, and caribou among them--Lopez draws powerful lessons from the land and imparts them assuredly and gracefully. <i>Arctic Dreams</i> deservedly won a National Book Award in 1986 when it was first published.s National Book Award-winning classic study of the Far North is widely considered his masterpiece.<br><br>Lopez offers a thorough examination of this obscure world-its terrain, its wildlife, its history of Eskimo natives and intrepid explorers who have arrived on their icy shores. But what turns this marvelous work of natural history into a breathtaking study of profound originality is his unique meditation on how the landscape can shape our imagination, desires, and dreams. Its prose as hauntingly pure as the land it describes, <b>Arctic Dreams</b> is nothing less than an indelible classic of modern literature.</p><h2>A Hunger for God: Desiring God through Fasting and Prayer</h2><p><p><strong>There is an appetite for God. And it can be awakened. I invite you to turn from the dulling effects of food and the dangers of idolatry, and to say with some simple fast: "This much, O God, I want you."</strong></p> <p>Our appetites dictate the direction of our lives--whether it be the cravings of our stomachs, the passionate desire for possessions or power, or the longings of our spirits for God. But for the Christian, the hunger for anything besides God can be an arch-enemy. While our hunger for God--and Him alone--is the only thing that will bring victory.</p> <p>Do you have that hunger for Him? As John Piper puts it: "If we don't feel strong desires for the manifestation of the glory of God, it is not because you have drunk deeply and are satisfied. It is because we have nibbled so long at the table of the world. Our soul is stuffed with small things, and there is no room for the great." If we are full of what the world offers, then perhaps a fast might express, or even increase, our soul's appetite for God.</p> <p>Between the dangers of self-denial and self-indulgence is this path of pleasant pain called fasting. It is the path John Piper invites you to travel in this book. For when God is the supreme hunger of your heart, He will be supreme in everything. And when you are most satisfied in Him, He will be most glorified in you.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Piper</strong> (DTheol, University of Munich) is founder and teacher of desiringGod.org and chancellor of Bethlehem College and Seminary.

Kennedy and Its Aftermath</h2><p><p>In the summer of 1962, nineteen-year-old Mimi Beardsley arrived by train in Washington, D.C., to begin an internship in the White House press office. The Kennedy Administration had reinvigorated the capital and the country&#x2014;and Mimi was eager to contribute. For a young woman from a privileged but sheltered upbringing, the job was the chance of a lifetime. Although she started as a lowly intern, Mimi made an impression on Kennedy&#x2019;s inner circle and, after just three days at the White House, she was presented to the President himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Almost immediately, the two began an affair that would continue for the next eighteen months.<br> &nbsp;<br> In an era when women in the workplace were still considered &#x201c;girls,&#x201d; Mimi was literally a girl herself&#x2014;na�ve, innocent, emotionally unprepared for the thrill that came when the President&#x2019;s charisma and power were turned on her full-force. She was also unprepared for the feelings of isolation that would follow as she fell into the double life of a college student who was also the secret lover of the most powerful man in the world. Then, after the President&#x2019;s tragic death in Dallas, she grieved in private, locked her secret away, and tried to start her life anew, only to find that her past would cast a long shadow&#x2014;and ultimately destroy her relationship with the man she married.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 2003, a Kennedy biographer mentioned &#x201c;a tall, slender, beautiful nineteen-year-old college sophomore and White House intern, who worked in the press office&#x201d; in reference to one of the President&#x2019;s affairs. The disclosure set off a tabloid frenzy and soon exposed Mimi and the secret that she had kept for forty-one years. Because her past had been revealed in such a shocking, public way, she was forced, for the first time, to examine the choices she&#x2019;d made. She came to understand that shutting down one part of her life so completely had closed her off from so much more.<br> &nbsp;<br> No longer defined by silence or shame, Mimi Alford has finally unburdened herself with this searingly honest account of her life and her extremely private moments with a very public man. <i>Once Upon a Secret</i> offers a new and personal depiction of one of our most iconic leaders and a powerful, moving story of a woman coming to terms with her past and moving out of the shadows to reclaim the truth.</p></p><p><b>Mimi Alford </b>lives in western Massachusetts with her husband, Dick.

Studies in neuroscience indicate that as much as 95% of our consciousness is actually subconscious. It&#x2019;s the subconscious mind that is the store-house for our attitudes, values, and beliefs. It is from our beliefs that we form perceptions about the world and ourselves, and from these perceptions we develop behaviors. Usually, it is self-defeating behaviors we wish to change. Often the most effective way to change a behavior is to change the subconscious belief(s) that support it. Based on years of split-brain research, also known as Brain Dominance Theory, PSYCH-K provides a variety of ways to quickly identify and transform beliefs that &#x201c;sabotage&#x201d; you into beliefs that &#x201c;support&#x201d; you, in any area of your life. Many people harbor self-sabotaging subconscious beliefs in the areas of financial prosperity, self-worth, health and body issues such as weight loss, as well as relationships and career. This book will help the reader discover; why you don't always do the right thing, even when you know the right thing to do; why trying smarter is better than trying harder; and why changihng yourself can change the world.

Irreverent, invaluable, and a lot cheaper than a year's tuition, this friendly guide is the smartest investment any future filmmaker could make.<br><br>Strategies from the book include: Love your friends for criticizing your work--especially at the script stage; Shyness won't get you the donuts; Duct tape miracles; Don't fall in love with cast or crew (but if you do...).</p><p><strong>Camille Landau</strong> and <strong>Tiare White</strong> are graduates of the American Film Institute and the USC film school.

They are currently in post-production for their first dramatic feature, <em>Three Loves</em>, and live in Southern California.Filmmakers Landau and White believe that "if you want to make films, make films." Since only four students in each class of 45 at the country's top film schools get chosen to direct an advanced narrative film, the authors urge hopefuls to honor the trial-and-error, Blair Witch-approved method: "if you want to be a filmmaker," they advise, "put down this book and pick up a camera." Though some of their imparted wisdom reads like an After School Special dialogue, the authors do project a healthy dose of industry know-how that could prove useful to those who have never entered the cutting rooms and bursar's offices of NYU, USC, UCLA or other prestigious establishments. The book offers concrete, creative suggestions for initiating a writing schedule, pooling financial resources (or choosing the right low-APR credit card) and feigning confidence in the face of blind fear. Among their best advice is this insight: "Your short film is only as good as your feature script" because "all that work and money [spent on the short film] add up, at best, to the invitation to submit a script to someone's office." The authors' enthusiasm for their subject is matched only by their delightful irreverence toward the industry itself, crediting doughnuts, duct tape and Red Vines as the stuff that reel dreams are made of.

Who would not be cheered by this? But let us not forget that knowledge and skills alone cannot lead humanity to a happy and dignified life. Humanity has every reason to place the proclaimers of high moral standards and values above the discoverers of objective truth. What humanity owes to personalities like Buddha, Moses, and Jesus ranks for me higher than all the achievements of the inquiring and constructive mind.&#x2014;Albert Einstein, The Human Side<br><i><br>Who cares about God? Prelude to a Neurological and Spiritual Revolution <br></i><br>God. &nbsp; <br><br>In America, I cannot think of any other word that stirs up the imagination more. Even young children raised in nonreligious communities understand the concept of God, and when asked, will willingly draw you a picture-usually the proverbial old man with the long hair and a beard. As children grow into adults, their pictures of God often evolve into abstract images of clouds, spirals, sunbursts, and even mirrors, as they attempt to integrate the properties of a reality they cannot see. In fact, the more a person thinks about God, the more complex and imaginative the concept becomes, taking on unique nuances of meaning that differ from one individual to the next. &nbsp;<br><br> If you contemplate God long enough, something surprising happens in the brain. Neural functioning begins to change. Different circuits become activated, while others become deactivated. New dendrites are formed, new synaptic connections are made, and the brain becomes more sensitive to subtle realms of experience. Perceptions alter, beliefs begin to change, and if God has meaning for you, then God becomes neurologically real. For some, God may remain a primitive concept, limited to the way a young child interprets the world. But for most people, God is transformed into a symbol or metaphor representing a wide range of personal, ethical, social, and universal values. And, if you happen to be a neuroscientist, God can be one of the most fascinating of human experiences to explore. &nbsp; <br><i><br>The Science of God &nbsp; <br></i><br>For the past fifteen years I have investigated the neural mechanisms of spirituality with the same fervor that a minister contemplates God. Some religious rituals do nothing more than relax you, others help to keep you focused and alert, but a few appear to take practitioners into transcendent realms of mystical experience where their entire lives are changed. &nbsp; <br><br>Our research team at the University of Pennsylvania has consistently demonstrated that God is part of our consciousness and that the more you think about God, the more you will alter the neural circuitry in specific parts of your brain. That is why I say, with the utmost confidence, that God can change your brain. And it doesn't matter if you're a Christian or a Jew, a Muslim or a Hindu, or an agnostic or an atheist. &nbsp; In Why God Won't Go Away, I demonstrated that the human brain is uniquely constructed to perceive and generate spiritual realities.1 Yet it has no way to ascertain the accuracy of such perceptions. Instead, our brain uses logic, reason, intuition, imagination, and emotion to integrate God and the universe into a complex system of personal values, behaviors, and beliefs. &nbsp; <br><br>But no matter how hard we try, the ultimate nature of the universe continues to elude our brain. So the bigger questions remain. Where does life originate, where does it end, and what ultimate purpose does it serve? Is there a spiritual reality, or is it merely a fabrication of the mind? If there is a God, does such an entity reach out to us like the hand that Michelangelo painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel? Or is it the other way around: Does our mind reach out to embrace a God that may or may not be real? &nbsp; <br><br>Neuroscience has yet to answer such questions, but it can record the effect that religious beliefs and experiences have upon the human brain. Furthermore, it can tell us how God-as an image, feeling, thought, or fact-is interpreted, reacted to, and turned into a perception that feels meaningful and real. But neuroscience cannot tell you if God does or doesn't exist. In fact, as far as we can tell, most of the human brain does not even worry if the things we see are actually real. Instead, it only needs to know if they are useful for survival. If a belief in God provides you with a sense of comfort and security, then God will enhance your life. But if you see God as a vindictive deity who gives you justification for inflicting harm on others, such a belief can actually damage your brain as it motivates you to act in socially destructive ways. &nbsp; <br><br>Having an accurate perception of reality is not one of the brain's strong points. Indeed, as Mark and I pointed out in Why We Believe What We Believe,* the human brain seems to have difficulty separating fantasies from facts.2 It sees things that are not there, and it sometimes doesn't see things that are there. In fact, the brain doesn't even try to create a fully detailed map of the external world. Instead, it selects a handful of cues, then fills in the rest with conjecture, fantasy, and belief. Rather than being a hindrance, such neurological ambiguity allows us to imagine and create a world filled with utopian, utilitarian, and sometimes useless things-from eye protectors for chickens to electronic corneas for the blind. &nbsp; <br><br>Likewise, when it comes to thinking about God, our brain creates a vast range of utopian, utilitarian, and sometimes useless theologies-from complex moral value systems to the number of angels that can fit on the head of a pin. But no matter how comprehensive our theologies become, our brain is rarely satisfied with its concepts and images of God. The end result of this remarkable contemplation has been the creation of thousands of differing spiritual practices and creeds. &nbsp; <br><br>Indeed, the more one contemplates God, the more mysterious God becomes. Some embrace this emergent ambiguity, some are frightened by it, some ignore it, and others reject it in its entirety. But the fact remains that every human brain, from early childhood on, contemplates the possibility that spiritual realms exist. Believers like Isaac Newton, agnostics like Charles Darwin, and atheists like Richard Dawkins have all given serious consideration to humanity's fascination with God, because the moment God is introduced to the human brain, the neurological concept will not go away. &nbsp; <br><br>Recently there has been a spate of antireligious books-among them, The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins; The End of Faith, Sam Harris; and God Is Not Great, Christopher Hitchens-that argue that religious beliefs are personally and societally dangerous. But the research, as we will outline throughout this book, strongly suggests otherwise. Nor do we believe that these authors represent the views of the vast majority of scientists or atheists. For example, though I am not specifically religious, I'm open to the possibility that God may exist, whereas Mark, my colleague and co-researcher, prefers to look at the universe through a purely naturalistic and evidence-based perspective. Yet we both appreciate and encourage religious and spiritual development-as long as it does not denigrate the lives or religious beliefs of others. &nbsp; <br><br>For the past four years, Mark and I have been studying how different concepts of God affect the human mind. I have brain-scanned Franciscan nuns as they immersed themselves in the presence of God, and charted the neurological changes as Buddhist practitioners contemplated the universe. I have watched what happens in the brains of Pentecostal practitioners who invited the Holy Spirit to speak to them in tongues, and have seen how the brains of atheists react-and don't react-when they meditate on a concrete image of God.<br><br>Along with my research staff at the University of Pennsylvania and the Center for Spirituality and the Mind, we are currently studying Sikhs, Sufis, yoga practitioners, and advanced meditators to map the neurochemical changes caused by spiritual and religious practices. Our research has led us to the following conclusions: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>1.&nbsp;Each part of the brain constructs a different perception of God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>2. Every human brain assembles its perceptions of God in uniquely different ways, thus giving God different qualities of meaning and value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>3. Spiritual practices, even when stripped of religious beliefs, enhance the neural functioning of the brain in ways that improve physical and emotional health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>4.&nbsp;Intense, long-term contemplation of God and other spiritual values appears to permanently change the structure of those parts of the brain that control our moods, give rise to our conscious notions of self, and shape our sensory perceptions of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>5.&nbsp;Contemplative practices strengthen a specific neurological circuit that generates peacefulness, social awareness, and compassion for others. &nbsp; <br><br>Spiritual practices also can be used to enhance cognition, communication, and creativity, and over time can even change our neurological perception of reality itself. Yet, it is a reality that we cannot objectively confirm. Instead, our research has led us to conclude that three separate realities intermingle to give us a working model of the world: the reality that actually exists outside of our brain, and two internal realities-maps that our brain constructs about the world. One of these maps is subconscious and primarily concerned with survival and the biological maintenance of the body. But this map is not the world itself; it's just a guide that helps us navigate the terrain. Human beings, however, construct a second internal reality-a map that reflects our conscious awareness of the un...</p><h2>We Need to Talk: How to Have Conversations That Matter</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;WE NEED TO TALK.&#x201d;</strong></p><p><strong>In this urgent and insightful book, public radio journalist Celeste Headlee shows us how to bridge what divides us--by having real conversations</strong></p><p>BASED ON THE TED TALK WITH OVER 10 MILLION VIEWS<br>NPR's Best Books of 2017</p><p>Winner of the 2017 Silver Nautilus Award in Relationships &amp; Communication </p><p><em>&#x201c;We Need to Talk&nbsp;</em>is an important read for a conversationally-challenged, disconnected age.

He didn't turn around but instead let his gaze fall to the busy city below. A deep sadness tangled his words, so he took a moment to compose himself. The inevitable had finally come, but it didn't make it any easier. </p> <p> He stayed at the window as he addressed Miss Hastings. </p> <p> "Contact family members, the various corporate boards and business interests . . ." He sighed. There was a lot to take care of. Now wasn't the time to mourn. And Hamilton knew that perhaps he mourned more for what Red had endured in life. </p> <p> Red was at peace now, but there would be nothing resembling peace in the wake of his death. "And let's call a meeting." </p> <p> "Yes, sir," Miss Hastings said. She turned to leave the room, then stopped and turned back to Hamilton. "Sir, I am so sorry for your loss." She pulled the heavy oak doors of his office closed. </p> <p> Clutching his cane, he gazed out the dark window and wondered how well he would be able to tolerate the wolves that had been waiting and circling for days now. Oh, yes, they would put on their sad faces. Some of them. Others would adopt a false solicitousness. No matter. Everything was set into motion now; no man could change it. And he doubted it would change any man, either. </p> <p> But for a man whose life had gone terribly wrong in so many different ways, he'd had hope all the way to the end. </p> <p> Hamilton closed his eyes. The older he got, the less he held out much optimism for anything. But maybe, just maybe, he had a little, too. </p> <p> His mind wandered back to the first time he'd ever heard Red's voice. It had been a phone call, placed to Hamilton right after he'd graduated from law school. </p> <p> "Am I speaking with Theophilus Hamilton?" </p> <p> "Sir, yes--Yes, sir. This is he." </p> <p> "Name's Howard Stevens. You can call me Red. I need a lawyer for a few business ideas I have, a few still in the dream stage." </p> <p> Hamilton smiled now. Red Stevens and his dreams. He was at peace. But Theophilus understood peace would not be a part of his own immediate future. </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>The day couldn't have been grayer. Hamilton stood near the pastor, surveying the five-hundred-plus mourners who clustered around the shiny mahogany casket of Red Stevens. Flowers, bright and white, were the only color among a graveyard filled with stately, above ground tombs and important people all dressed in suitable dark clothing, every single one carrying a black umbrella. </p> <p> Their faces reflected more aversion to the rain they were forced to stand in than to the death of the man they were here to lament. Behind the mourners and down the hill a little, Hamilton spotted one pink umbrella, which was doing a poor job of protecting its keeper from the rain, since the young girl wasn't putting it over her head. Instead, she seemed to be the only one embracing the moment, with her face tilted upward to the sky as it bathed her in wetness. </p> <p> Hamilton sighed. Oh, how he wished there could be more of that kind of goodness and innocence in the world. </p> <p> The pastor, hunched under his own black umbrella, cupping his little black book, was doing his best to uphold the sanctity of the moment. "Though the skies may weep," he said, "the Bible assures us that 'precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.'" </p> <p> No one--near Hamilton, anyway--looked as though they cared at all what the Bible said. Red's two sons, Bill and Jack, stood just three feet away, oblivious to the idea they were supposed to appear sorrowful. </p> <p> "I wonder who the old man negotiated with for the rain," Jack said with a cynical smile to Bill, Red's oldest. </p> <p> "Well, it's a sure bet he's laughing, watching us get soaked." </p> <p> "Yeah, well, now it's his turn," Jack said. </p> <p> "There's not a person here," the pastor continued, "whose life in some way has not been touched by Howard 'Red' Stevens." </p> <p> Hamilton watched Jack and Bill glance at each other and roll their eyes. Jack, the playboy of the family, pulled up the sleeve of his coat and looked at his watch. Bill glanced down at some sort of organizing device or cell phone in his hand, then quietly put it back in his pocket. It was all Hamilton could do not to say something, but that wasn't his way. And it hadn't been Red's either. He'd let his children become what they'd become. He'd tried a time or two to step in and talk some sense into any of them who would listen, but they never listened unless he was talking in the language of dollar signs. </p> <p> Hamilton's gaze found its way back to the little girl, who seemed intent on getting wet. He wondered why such a young girl felt the need to wear such dark lipstick. She couldn't have been more than ten years old, but her lips were stained the color of wine grapes. What was the world coming to? But he smiled as the mother suddenly noticed the umbrella to her side and rushed to put it back in its place, much to the young girl's disappointment. </p> <p> "Red often quoted Malcolm Muggeridge," the pastor said to a crowd growing more agitated with every wet minute that went by, "saying that 'every happening, great or small, is a parable by which God speaks to us; and the art of life is to get the message.' </p> <p> May the message of Red Stevens continue in the hearts of those he leaves behind." </p> <p> The pastor seemed to sense he was losing their interest. He turned to Bill. "Bill?" He gestured toward the casket. </p> <p> "Uh . . . yes," Bill said, stepping forward. Reaching into his coat, he pulled out a small canister. "Even though Dad moved his corporate offices from Texas many years ago, for tax reasons, he always said he wanted to be buried under Texas soil." He opened the canister and shook some dirt onto the casket, then stepped back. </p> <p> Somebody touched Hamilton's elbow. He didn't have to turn around. He knew it was Miss Hastings, assuring him he was right for keeping silent and avoiding a scene. </p> <p> Suddenly the loud rumblings of a car caused the entire crowd to turn as a vintage 1971 Dodge Charger R/T slowed on the small cemetery road below. What little dirt was left on the casket fell off as the ground shook from the revving engine. Hamilton could hardly stop himself from throwing up his hands in disgust. But then again, neither could the other mourners, whose mouths hung open at the sight of the yellow-and-black muscle car roaring to a stop in front of them. </p> <p> The young man getting out of the car was apparently the only one who hadn't gotten the family memo about what kind of etiquette was expected. He flung the car door open, nursing a cigarette and likely a bad hangover, judging by the state of his clothes and hair. Some hideous rock-and-roll song thumped against the backdrop of the rainstorm, until he turned it off and rose out of the car. He wore black sunglasses and an expression that might've been worse if they could see his eyes. Beside him an expressionless young woman appeared in a taut black dress that spoke to the idea she might be at the wrong social event. </p> <p> "Is that him?" Miss Hastings whispered. </p> <p> "That's him." Hamilton sighed. He watched Jason Stevens walk up the small hill, dismissing his cigarette as he tossed it aside into a puddle. He also dismissed his girlfriend and two others who had crawled unsteadily from the backseat of the car, walking ahead of all of them and heading straight for his mother, Sarah. </p> <p> "Mom," he said. </p> <p> Even with all the Botox she'd managed over the years, his mother was able to lift her eyebrows high in a frightful expression of embarrassment and shock. "You're late!" she said in a sharp tone. </p> <p> Jason Stevens propped his sunglasses on top of his head, glancing around at his family members with the kind of attitude that got you cut out of the will. </p> <p> Then he offered a perfectly inappropriate smile. "For what?"</p></p><h2>Blindsight</h2><p>Two months since the stars fell...<br><br>Two months since sixty-five thousand alien objects clenched around the Earth like a luminous fist, screaming to the heavens as the atmosphere burned them to ash. Two months since that moment of brief, bright surveillance by agents unknown. <br><br>Two months of silence, while a world holds its breath.<br><br>Now some half-derelict space probe, sparking fitfully past Neptune's orbit, hears a whisper from the edge of the solar system: a faint signal sweeping the cosmos like a lighthouse beam. Whatever's out there isn't talking to us. It's talking to some distant star, perhaps. Or perhaps to something closer, something <i>en route</i>.<br><br>So who do you send to force introductions on an intelligence with motives unknown, maybe unknowable? Who do you send to meet the alien when the alien doesn't want to meet?<br><br>You send a linguist with multiple personalities, her brain surgically partitioned into separate, sentient processing cores. You send a biologist so radically interfaced with machinery that he sees x-rays and tastes ultrasound, so compromised by grafts and splices he no longer feels his own flesh. You send a pacifist warrior in the faint hope she won't be needed, and the fainter one she'll do any good if she is. You send a monster to command them all, an extinct hominid predator once called <i>vampire</i>, recalled from the grave with the voodoo of recombinant genetics and the blood of sociopaths. And you send a <i>synthesist</i>--an informational topologist with half his mind gone--as an interface between <i>here </i>and <i>there</i>, a conduit through which the Dead Center might hope to understand the Bleeding Edge.<br><br>You send them all to the edge of interstellar space, praying you can trust such freaks and retrofits with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they've been sent to find.<br><br>But you'd give anything for that to be true, if you only knew what was waiting for them... <br></p><p>PETER WATTS lives in Toronto, Canada.<br>Chapter One<br>Blood makes noise.<br>&nbsp;--Suzanne Vega<br>&nbsp;<br>Imagine you are Siri Keeton.<br>&nbsp;<br>You wake in an agony of resurrection, gasping after a record-shattering bout of sleep apnea spanning one hundred forty days. You can feel your blood, syrupy with dobutamine and leuenkephalin, forcing its way through arteries shriveled by months on standby. The body inflates in painful increments: blood vessels dilate, flesh peels apart from flesh, ribs crack in your ears with sudden unaccustomed flexion. Your joints have seized up through disuse. You're a stick man, frozen in some perverse rigor vitae.<br>&nbsp;<br>You'd scream if you had the breath.<br>&nbsp;<br>Vampires did this all the time, you remember. It was normal for them, it was their own unique take on resource conservation. They could have taught your kind a few things about restraint, if that absurd aversion to right angles hadn't done them in at the dawn of civilization. Maybe they still can. They're back now, after all--raised from the grave with the voodoo of paleogenetics, stitched together from junk genes and fossil marrow steeped in the blood of sociopaths and high-functioning autistics. One of them commands this very mission. A handful of his genes live on in your own body so it too can rise from the dead, here at the edge of interstellar space. Nobody gets past Jupiter without becoming part vampire.<br>&nbsp;<br>The pain begins, just slightly, to recede. You fire up your inlays and access your own vitals. It'll be long minutes before your body responds fully to motor commands, hours before it stops hurting. The pain's an unavoidable side effect. That's just what happens when you splice vampire subroutines into Human code. You asked about painkillers once, but nerve blocks of any kind compromise metabolic reactivation. Suck it up, soldier.<br>&nbsp;<br>You wonder if this was how it felt for Chelsea, before the end. But that evokes a whole other kind of pain, so you block it out and concentrate on the life pushing its way back into your extremities. Suffering in silence, you check the logs for fresh telemetry.<br>&nbsp;<br>You think: That can't be right.<br>&nbsp;<br>Because if it is, you're in the wrong part of the universe. You're not in the Kuiper Belt where you belong: you're high above the ecliptic and deep into the Oort, the realm of long-period comets that only grace the sun every million years or so. You've gone interstellar, which means (you bring up the system clock) you've been undead for eighteen hundred days.<br>&nbsp;<br>You've overslept by almost five years.<br>&nbsp;<br>The lid of your coffin slides away. Your own cadaverous body reflects from the mirrored bulkhead opposite, a desiccated lungfish waiting for the rains. Bladders of isotonic saline cling to its limbs like engorged antiparasites, like the opposite of leeches. You remember the needles going in just before you shut down, way back when your veins were more than dry twisted filaments of beef jerky.<br>&nbsp;<br>Szpindel's reflection stares back from his own pod to your immediate right. His face is as bloodless and skeletal as yours. His wide sunken eyes jiggle in their sockets as he reacquires his own links, sensory interfaces so massive that your own off-the-shelf inlays amount to shadow puppetry in comparison.<br>&nbsp;<br>You hear coughing and the rustling of limbs just past line of sight, catch glimpses of reflected motion where the others stir at the edge of vision.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Wha . . . " your voice is barely more than a hoarse whisper, ". . . happ . . . ?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Szpindel works his jaw. Bone cracks audibly.<br>&nbsp;<br>". . . Sssuckered," he hisses.<br>&nbsp;<br>You haven't even met the aliens yet, and already they're running rings around you.<br>&nbsp;<br>So we dragged ourselves back from the dead: five part-time cadavers, naked, emaciated, barely able to move even in zero g. We emerged from our coffins like premature moths ripped from their cocoons, still half-grub. We were alone and off course and utterly helpless, and it took a conscious effort to remember: They would never have risked our lives if we hadn't been essential.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Morning, commissar." Isaac Szpindel reached one trembling, insensate hand for the feedback gloves at the base of his pod. Just past him, Susan James was curled into a loose fetal ball, murmuring to herselves. Only Amanda Bates, already dressed and cycling through a sequence of bone-cracking isometrics, possessed anything approaching mobility. Every now and then she tried bouncing a rubber ball off the bulkhead; but not even she was up to catching it on the rebound yet.<br>&nbsp;<br>The journey had melted us down to a common archetype. James's round cheeks and hips; Szpindel's high forehead and lumpy, lanky chassis--even the enhanced carboplatinum brick shit house that Bates used for a body--all had shriveled to the same desiccated collection of sticks and bones. Even our hair seemed to have become strangely discolored during the voyage, although I knew that was impossible. More likely it was just filtering the pallor of the skin beneath. Still. The pre-dead James had been dirty blond, Szpindel's hair had been almost dark enough to call black, but the stuff floating from their scalps looked the same dull kelpy brown to me now. Bates kept her head shaved, but even her eyebrows weren't as rusty as I remembered them.<br>&nbsp;<br>We'd revert to our old selves soon enough. Just add water. For now, though, the old slur was freshly relevant: The Undead really did all look the same, if you didn't know how to look.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you did, of course--if you forgot appearance and watched for motion, ignored meat and studied topology--you'd never mistake one for another. Every facial tic was a data point, every conversational pause spoke volumes more than the words to either side. I could see James's personae shatter and coalesce in the flutter of an eyelash. Szpindel's unspoken distrust of Amanda Bates shouted from the corner of his smile. Every twitch of the phenotype cried aloud to anyone who knew the language.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Where's--" James croaked, coughed, waved one spindly arm at Sarasti's empty coffin gaping at the end of the row.<br>&nbsp;<br>Szpindel's lips cracked in a small rictus. "Gone back to Fab, eh? Getting the ship to build some dirt to lie on."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Probably communing with the Captain." Bates breathed louder than she spoke, a dry rustle from pipes still getting reacquainted with the idea of respiration.<br>&nbsp;<br>James again: "Could do that up here."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Could take a dump up here, too," Szpindel rasped. "Some things you do by yourself, eh?"<br>&nbsp;<br>And some things you kept to yourself. Not many baselines felt comfortable locking stares with a vampire--Sarasti, ever courteous, tended to avoid eye contact for exactly that reason--but there were other surfaces to his topology, just as mammalian and just as readable. If he had withdrawn from public view, maybe I was the reason. Maybe he was keeping secrets.<br>&nbsp;<br>After all, Theseus damn well was.<br>&nbsp;<br>She'd taken us a good fifteen AUs toward our destination before something scared her off course. Then she'd skidded north like a startled cat and started climbing: a wild high three-g burn off the ecliptic, thirteen hundred tonnes of momentum bucking against Newton's first. She'd emptied her Penn tanks, bled dry her substrate mass, squandered a hundred forty days' of fuel in hours. Then a long cold coast through the abyss, years of stingy accounting, the thrust of every antiproton weighed against the drag of sieving it from the void. Teleportation isn't magic: the Icarus stream couldn't send us the actual antimatter it made, only the quantum specs. Theseus had to filterfeed the raw material from space, one ion at a time. For long dark years she'd made do on pure inertia, hording every swallowed atom. Then a flip; ionizing lasers strafing the space ahead; a ramscoop thrown wide in a hard brake. The weight of a trillion trillion protons slowed her down and refilled her gut and flattened us all over again. Theseus had burned relentlessly until almost the moment of our resurrection.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was easy enough to retrace those steps; our course was there in ConSensus for anyone to see. Exactly why the ship had blazed that trail was another matter. Doubtless it would all come out during the post-rez briefing. We were hardly the first vessel to travel under the cloak of sealed orders, and if there'd been a pressing need to know by now we'd have known by now. Still, I wondered who had locked out the Comm logs. Mission Control, maybe. Or Sarasti. Or Theseus herself, for that matter. It was easy to forget the Quantical AI at the heart of our ship. It stayed so discreetly in the background, nurtured and carried us and permeated our existence like an unobtrusive god; but like God, it never took your calls.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sarasti was the official intermediary. When the ship did speak, it spoke to him--and Sarasti called it Captain.<br>&nbsp;<br>So did we all.<br>&nbsp;<br>He'd given us four hours to come back. It took more than three just to get me out of the crypt. By then my brain was at least firing on most of its synapses, although my body--still sucking fluids like a thirsty sponge--continued to ache with every movement. I swapped out drained electrolyte bags for fresh ones and headed aft.<br>&nbsp;<br>Fifteen minutes to spin-up. Fifty to the post-resurrection briefing. Just enough time for those who preferred gravity-bound sleep to haul their personal effects into the drum and stake out their allotted 4.4 square meters of floor space.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gravity--or any centripetal facsimile thereof--did not appeal to me. I set up my own tent in zero g and as far to stern as possible, nuzzling the forward wall of the starboard shuttle tube. The tent inflated like an abscess on Theseus's spine, a little climate-controlled bubble of atmosphere in the dark cavernous vacuum beneath the ship's carapace. My own effects were minimal; it took all of thirty seconds to stick them to the wall, and another thirty to program the tent's environment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Afterward I went for a hike. After five years, I needed the exercise.<br>&nbsp;<br>Stern was closest, so I started there, at the shielding that separated payload from propulsion. A single sealed hatch blistered the aft bulkhead dead center. Behind it, a service tunnel wormed back through machinery best left untouched by Human hands. The fat superconducting torus of the ramscoop ring; the antennae fan behind it, unwound now into an indestructible soap bubble big enough to shroud a city, its face turned sunward to catch the faint quantum sparkle of the Icarus antimatter stream. More shielding behind that; then the telematter reactor, where raw hydrogen and refined information conjured fire three hundred times hotter than the sun's. I knew the incantations, of course--antimatter cracking and deconstruction, the teleportation of quantum serial numbers--but it was still magic to me, how we'd come so far so fast. It would have been magic to anyone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Except Sarasti, maybe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Around me, the same magic worked at cooler temperatures and to less volatile ends: a small riot of chutes and dispensers crowded the bulkhead on all sides. A few of those openings would choke on my fist: one or two could swallow me whole. Theseus's fabrication plant could build everything from cutlery to cockpits. Give it a big enough matter stockpile and it could have even built another Theseus, albeit in many small pieces and over a very long time. Some wondered if it could build another crew as well, although we'd all been assured that was impossible. Not even these machines had fine enough fingers to reconstruct a few trillion synapses in the space of a human skull. Not yet, anyway.<br>&nbsp;<br>I believed it. They would never have shipped us out fully assembled if there'd been a cheaper alternative.<br>&nbsp;<br>I faced forward. Putting the back of my head against that sealed hatch I could see almost to Theseus's bow, an uninterrupted line of sight extending to a tiny dark bull's-eye thirty meters ahead. It was like staring at a great textured target in shades of white and gray: concentric circles, hatches centered within bulkheads one behind another, perfectly aligned. Every one stood open, in nonchalant defiance of a previous generation's safety codes. We could keep them closed if we wanted to, if it made us feel safer. That was all it would do, though; it wouldn't improve our empirical odds one whit. In the event of trouble those hatches would slam shut long milliseconds before Human senses could even make sense of an alarm. They weren't even computer-controlled. Theseus's body parts had reflexes.<br>&nbsp;<br>I pushed off against the stern plating--wincing at the tug and stretch of disused tendons--and coasted forward, leaving Fab behind. The shuttle-access hatches to Scylla and Charybdis briefly constricted my passage to either side. Past them the spine widened into a corrugated extensible cylinder two meters across and--at the moment--maybe fifteen long. A pair of ladders ran opposite each other along its length; raised portholes the size of manhole covers stippled the bulkhead to either side. Most of those just looked into the hold. A couple served as general-purpose airlocks, should anyone want to take a stroll beneath the carapace. One opened into my tent. Another, four meters farther forward, opened into Bates's.<br>&nbsp;<br>From a third, just short of the forward bulkhead, Jukka Sarasti climbed into view like a long white spider.<br>&nbsp;<br>If he'd been Human I'd have known instantly what I saw there, I'd have smelled murderer all over his topology. And I wouldn't have been able to even guess at the number of his victims, because his affect was so utterly without remorse.

Jahanara is the daughter of one of these powerful figures, Shah Jahan, The Magnificent. A lover of refinement, his courts are of the finest architecture, priceless painting, unbelievable gardens, and ultra-fabulous wealth. Jahanara, the oldest and favorite of his children, is showered with emeralds and diamonds and rubies. She is attended by numerous servants and learned tutors. But her world is not one of complete</p><p>Gr. 4-8. Steeped in period detail and related with immediacy by an intelligent, sensitive, 14-year-old princess, this entry in the Royal Diaries series transports readers to seventeenth-century India during the Moghul Dynasty. Jahanara, favorite daughter of Emperor Shah Jahan and the most beloved of his four wives, writes about family jealousies, court intrigues, and war strategies, as well as the extravagant lifestyle of her royal family, who live in a setting where wall murals of flowers crafted in gemstones glitter by lamplight as though in bloom. Readers encounter historical figures, such as Empress Mumtaz Mahal, for whom the Taj Mahal was built, as well as fictional characters introduced to explore the practices of the times--among them, the gardener, whose eyes were stitched closed as punishment for spying. The language seems true to the thoughts and sensitivities of a young teen, and Lasky's meticulous research is evident throughout the journal, which references issues such as religious tolerance, the impact of Islamic extremism, and women's efforts to gain respect--issues that are as vital today as they were during Jahanara's life. <i>Ellen Mandel</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In fact, if old Mrs. Molfrey, her neighbor, didn't report it to Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby, Simone's disappearance might have gone unrecorded in Fawcett Green. But ever Barnaby isn't concerned-until a body is found.<br><br>Soon Barnaby is uncovering the passionate entanglements beneath the placid surface of Fawcett Green-and perhaps jeopardizing his career. Now, if he misconstrues the clue buried in Simone's garden-and a subtlety of human behavior his experienced eye should spot-a brutal killer may go free...<br></p><p>Can you name a mystery about bell ringing? Of course--<i>The Nine Tailors</i>, by Dorothy L. Sayers. How about another? Well, this book about small-town British coppers Chief Inspector Barnaby and Sergeant Troy might qualify: it begins when a young female campanologist in the village of Fawcett Green fails to show up for practice. Was Simone Hollingsworth kidnapped for ransom? Was her doting new husband involved? Or does her disappearance have something to do with her snooping neighbors--especially the neighbor's obsessive daughter? As she did so well in <i>Written in Blood</i>, Caroline Graham captures the inwardly seething inhabitants of a supposedly placid village with the skill of an expert entomologist observing an anthill. And Barnaby and Troy are once again the perfect pair: the chief inspector's calm introspection is a fine match for the younger, brasher officer's occasional outbursts and blunders. Not the least of Graham's accomplishments is keeping the subgenre of the traditional British village mystery fresh and meaningful. <i>--Dick Adler</i>Caroline Graham lives in Suffolk, England. She has an M.A. in writing for the theater and has written several plays for both radio and theater, as well as the Chief Inspector Barnaby novels, which have been adapted for television..<br></p><h2>The Verdant Passage (Dark Sun World: Prism Pentad, Book 1)</h2><p>Under a previous sun, Athas teemed with life.

Ignatius ignores them as he heaves his vast bulk through the city&#39;s fleshpots in a noble crusade against vice, modernity and ignorance. But his momma has a nasty surprise in store for him. Ignatius must get a job. Undaunted, he uses his new-found employment to further his mission - and now he has a pirate costume and a hot-dog cart to do it with ...</p><p><i>"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs."</i><p> Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i>. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ("Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job. </p><p> Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>When Walker Percy penned these prophetic words in his foreword to the first edition of A Confederacy of Dunces, he could not have known just how wide Toole's "world of readers" would become. Released by Louisiana State University Press in April 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon. Turned down by countless publishers and submitted by the author's mother years after his suicide, the book won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Today, there are over 1,500,000 copies in print worldwide in eighteen languages.<p>Toole's lunatic and sage novel introduces one of the most memorable characters in American literature, Ignatius Reilly, whom Percy dubs "slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one -- who is in violent revolt against the entire modern age". Ignatius' ire explodes when his mother backs her car into another automobile. The owner of the damaged vehicle insists on payment; Mrs. Reilly demands that her son cease watching television and writing in his Big Chief tablet and get a job.</p><p>Set in New Orleans, A Confederacy of Dunces outswifts Swift, one of whose essays gives the book its title. As its characters burst into life, they leave the region and literature forever changed by their presences -- Ignatius and his mother; Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levy Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; Jones, the jivecat in space-age dark glasses.

But not before a couple of set-up yarns. &#x201c;Kingdom Come,&#x201d; drawn by Niko Henrichon more loosely and cartoony than main-story artist Mark Buckingham would have, tells how the torch Boy Blue has long carried for Rose Red is snuffed out, and &#x201c;Skulduggery&#x201d; is a hostage-rescue thriller with Cinderella as the ruthless rescuer. The rest of the book is the war, which is satisfyingly heroic and gritty but, as it happens, not the grand finale of the Fables saga. A further volume of denouement is promised. Goody! --Ray Olson</p><h2>Homespun Sarah</h2><p>Simple rhyming text presents the everyday life of a young girl, living on a Pennsylvania farm in the early eighteenth century, who is quickly outgrowing her dress.</p><p>Grade 1-4-An 18th-century Pennsylvania farm girl has outgrown her dress. "Sarah dressing,/Bodice, snug./Ankles showing,/Long skirt, tug." Through compact verses and an efficient use of words, the author accurately pictures the tasks necessary in making Sarah's new homespun dress. "Washing, drying,/Flax on racks./Carding, combing,/Wool in sacks/-Dyeing, weaving,/Balls of thread. /Linsey-woolsey,/Blue and red." Woven into the story are facts and information about farm life in the 1700s. An author's note points out the historical material found in the verses. Research is also evident in the watercolor and graphite illustrations that accurately depict the daily chores. The clothing, the cabin, and its furnishings all reflect the simple, but utilitarian lifestyle. Through efficient brush strokes and quick penciled lines, Rand captures the emotions of a hardworking family-the urgency and fear when Mother's dress catches on fire, and the joy when Sarah's dress is finished. He also includes humorous asides, such as a toe peeking out of Brother's shoe. From beginning to end, the text and illustrations are equal partners. The historical accuracy makes this book a great inclusion for Colonial units, while the beauty of language and illustrations make it a wonderful story.-Carolyn Janssen, Children's Learning Center of the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, OH<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.K-Gr. 3. Succinct, rhyming text and warm watercolor-and-acrylic spreads help to introduce and celebrate eighteenth-century Pennsylvania farm life. Sarah rises early and prepares for her chores--hauling water, gathering firewood, weeding the garden, washing clothes, making candles, picking berries, spinning flax, and, finally, helping Mother to sew a new dress. Along the way, there are disasters to be averted, such as putting out the fire that catches on Mother's dress as she cooks a meal. The text is brief ("Homespun Sarah, / Braided head. / Warm quilt, snuggle, / Feather bed."), but Kay works in plenty of information, and her author's note clarifies specific customs (children stand at the dinner table) that may be unfamiliar to listeners. Rand's earth-tone illustrations elaborate the text and also detail setting and clothing particulars. This makes a good choice for primary classrooms studying pioneers. Children will enjoy hearing the story read aloud; let them pour over the illustrations later. <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

With love, passion, and empathy, Kennedy and Davis bring to life the history of a working-class lesbian community. A complex, fascinating, and evocative world, it has much to tell us about gender, sexuality, class, and urban life. Above all, this is a story about the triumph of the human spirit over horrible adversity. The voices of these women sing on every page. -- John D'Emilio, University of North Carolina at Greensboro<br><strong></strong><strong><em>Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold</em></strong> incorporates both academic values of sound scholarship and the lesbian community's need for roots and for affirmation of our identity as woman-loving women. -- <strong></strong><strong><em>The Empty Chest</em></strong><br>This very first community study of lesbians will radically advance the state of knowledge in gay and lesbian studies.

BOMC Main. QPB Alt. Tour.</p><p>Vikram Seth was born in 1952. He trained as an economist and has lived for several years each in England, California, China and India. He is the author of A Suitable Boy, which was an international number one bestseller, An Equal Music and several other novels. He has also written five volumes of poetry including Beastly Tales.Set in newly independent India, Nehru's early 1950's, this adipose saga counterbalances a book of social manners--the marrying off of a well-to-do educated young woman, Lata Mehra--with a historical account (even at the level of transcribed parliamentary debate) of the subcontinent trying to find its societal bearings vis-...-vis language, religion, and the redistribution of estate-lands taken off the hands of the elite. Set mainly in Brahmpur, the story encompasses four well-off families, with a focus mostly on the younger members--poets, academics, playboys, newlyweds--who stitch a pattern of peccadillo through their elders' expectations. Meanwhile, Seth, whose California novel in verse, The Golden Gate (1986), was clever and energetic in concept but dull and soapy in final effect, falls into the same trap here: lots of stuff obviously--at a marathon 1300-plus pages--but characters made out of clich&#x201a;, with background-India the very stuffed pillow of local color that keeps them standing. The book, too, fairly squeaks with its own pleasure in itself, larded with poetry and a general recommendation of art over politics and money: the characters it spends the most time over are narcissists. Anyone wanting to read how a marriageable daughter can X-ray a whole society ought to let this cream-puff-wrapped-in-a-cinder-block pass and return to Tanizaki's classic Japanese masterpiece, The Makioka Sisters.

Bell</i> ruling made government sterilization of &#x201c;undesirable&#x201d; citizens the law of the land</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>In 1927, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling so disturbing, ignorant, and cruel that it stands as one of the great injustices in American history. In <i>Imbeciles</i>, bestselling author Adam Cohen exposes the court&#x2019;s decision to allow the sterilization of a young woman it wrongly thought to be &#x201c;feebleminded&#x201d; and to champion the mass eugenic sterilization of undesirable citizens for the greater good of the country. The 8&#x2013;1 ruling was signed by some of the most revered figures in American law&#x2014;including Chief Justice William Howard Taft, a former U.S. president; and Louis Brandeis, a progressive icon. Oliver Wendell Holmes, considered by many the greatest Supreme Court justice in history, wrote the majority opinion, including the court&#x2019;s famous declaration &#x201c;Three generations of imbeciles are enough.&#x201d;<br><i><br>Imbeciles</i> is the shocking story of <i>Buck v. Bell</i>, a legal case that challenges our faith in American justice. A gripping courtroom drama, it pits a helpless young woman against powerful scientists, lawyers, and judges who believed that eugenic measures were necessary to save the nation from being &#x201c;swamped with incompetence.&#x201d;&nbsp; At the center was Carrie Buck, who was born into a poor family in Charlottesville, Virginia, and taken in by a foster family, until she became pregnant out of wedlock. She was then declared &#x201c;feebleminded&#x201d; and shipped off to the Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded.<br><i><br>Buck v. Bell </i>unfolded against the backdrop of a nation in the thrall of eugenics, which many Americans thought would uplift the human race. Congress embraced this fervor, enacting the first laws designed to prevent immigration by Italians, Jews, and other groups charged with being genetically inferior.&nbsp; <br><br>Cohen shows how Buck arrived at the colony at just the wrong time, when influential scientists and politicians were looking for a &#x201c;test case&#x201d; to determine whether Virginia&#x2019;s new eugenic sterilization law could withstand a legal challenge. A cabal of powerful men lined up against her, and no one stood up for her&#x2014;not even her lawyer, who, it is now clear, was in collusion with the men who wanted her sterilized.<br><br>In the end, Buck&#x2019;s case was heard by the Supreme Court, the institution established by the founders to ensure that justice would prevail. The court could have seen through the false claim that Buck was a threat to the gene pool, or it could have found that forced sterilization was a violation of her rights. Instead, Holmes, a scion of several prominent Boston Brahmin families, who was raised to believe in the superiority of his own bloodlines, wrote a vicious, haunting decision upholding Buck&#x2019;s sterilization and imploring the nation to sterilize many more.<br> Holmes got his wish, and before the madness ended some sixty to seventy thousand Americans were sterilized. Cohen overturns cherished myths and demolishes lauded figures in relentless pursuit of the truth.

Reissue.</p><p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became, quite simply, the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, written towards the end of the First World War, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, who was to become the most popular detective in crime fiction since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.It's classic Christie. Amid a peaceful English setting, a hiker dies at the foot of a cliff. Was he pushed, or did he slip? Christie's original plot twists make it easy to arrive at incorrect conclusions and then have to rethink the mystery. Emilia Fox, who has a name worthy to be a Christie character herself, has a crisply captivating voice as she showcases characters who are lively, clever, sympathetic, and detestable, as the unfolding story demands. Packaging is good, other than an overcrowded cover. Note the Orange Triangle announcing that this is a "Mystery Masters" and thus unabridged.

Today, the more than 17,000 libraries in America also function as de facto community centers offering free access to the internet, job-hunting assistance, or a warm place to take shelter. And yet, across the country, cities large and small are closing public libraries or curtailing their hours of operation. Over the last eighteen years, photographer Robert Dawson has crisscrossed the country documenting hundreds of these endangered institutions. <em>The Public Library</em> presents a wide selection of Dawson's photographs&#x2014; from the majestic reading room at the New York Public Library to Allensworth, California's one-room Tulare County Free Library built by former slaves. Accompanying Dawson's revealing photographs are essays, letters, and poetry by some of America's most celebrated writers. A foreword by Bill Moyers and an afterword by Ann Patchett bookend this important survey of a treasured American institution.</p><p>Robert Dawson&#39;s photographs have been recognized by a Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Dorothea Lange-Paul Taylor Prize. He is an instructor of photography at San Jose State University and Stanford University."A book for anyone with a deep and abiding love of libraries. Dawson's latest project is a powerful argument for the continued relevance of our public libraries as information and community centers, even as libraries adapt to changing technological and budgetary landscapes." - Library Journal<br><br>"This collection of photographs and texts of and about libraries--grand or dead, faded or sumptuous--make up a narrative that combines the public sphere with private memory. Robert Dawson's work is an irrefutable argument for the preservation of public libraries. His book is profound and heartbreakingly beautiful." -- Toni Morrison<br><br>"This beautifully crafted book celebrates public libraries across the U.S. in both color and black and white images captured by photographer Dawson over an 18-year period. Artfully arranged in such chapters as 'Civic Memory and Identity' and 'Literature and Learning,' the book includes a foreword by Bill Moyers and an afterword by Ann Patchett.. Dawson goes beyond the physical structures and touches on how viscerally and nostalgically Americans feel about public libraries, and suggests that, as a culture, we depend on them more than we know." - Publishers Weekly<br><br>"The Public Library is absolutely wonderful in its entirety, at once an ode to the glory of our most democratic institutions and a culturally necessary prompt to defend them like we would defend our freedom to live, learn, and be-a freedom to which the library is our highest celebration." - Brain Pickings<br><br>"Rich imagery of libraries across the national and cultural map, from cherished landmarks of the heartland to a Death Valley trailer parked in shade to lessen the heat. Add thoughtful text from the likes of Barbara Kingsolver to Amy Tan, and Dawson's subject goes beyond buildings to celebrate the civic realm." - San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"If you think all public libraries look pretty much the same, well, you need to take a look at this book. Oh, sure, there are plenty of grand ones, such as Philadelphia's own Central Library on the Parkway. But we also have the Fishtown Community Branch, featured in this volume, which used to be a firehouse and, before that, a stable. There's also the log cabin library in Cable, Wis. And many, many more, both grand and humble." - Philadelphia Inquirer<br><br>"For book lovers, library denizens, and fans of architecture or Americana, The Public Library is a delight." - The Christian Science Monitor<br><br>"Dawson's project makes a powerful case for how public libraries serve communities in every corner of the country." - The New Yorker's Page Turner blog</p><h2>The Weekend Baker</h2><p>Containing both sweet and savory recipes inspired by cities from around the world, including Paris, Copenhagen, Miami, New York, London, and Naples, Paul takes classic bakes and gives them his own twist.

There's only one safe place, and it has Ranger's name all over it---if she can find it. And if the Junkman doesn't find her first.

Looking for a place to hide out from the killer until the cops catch up with him, Stephanie sneaks into her fellow bounty hunter Ranger's apartment without telling Morelli, who's not overly fond of him.

The most popular book of daily devotions ever published.</p><p>Oswald Chambers, a Scotsman who converted to Christianity in his teens under the ministry of Charles Spurgeon, has been affecting Christians with his devotional words since <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i> was first published in 1935. This acknowledged classic contains 365 daily readings that take heady doctrine and make it practical, realistic, and intensely personal. With humor and humility, Chambers speaks plainly to the common man struggling with devotion to Christ in daily living. Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels." This is Chambers's chief desire, directing the reader to "shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only--My Utmost for His Highest... determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><p>It&#x2019;s one of the best-loved devotionals of all time. . .and now it&#x2019;s back in Barbour&#x2019;s special promotional edition!

A first novel. 40,000 first printing. BOMC Alt &amp; QPB. Tour.</p><p>At first glance, a novel that promises to expose the unethical practices of the American meat industry may not be at the top of your reading list, but Ruth Ozeki's debut, <i>My Year of Meats</i> is well worth a second look. Like the author, the novel's protagonist, Jane Takagi-Little, is a Japanese-American documentary filmmaker; like Ozeki, who was once commissioned by a beef lobbying group to make television shows for the Japanese market, Jane is invited to work on a Japanese television show meant to encourage beef consumption via the not-so-subliminal suggestion that prime rib equals a perfect family: <blockquote> TO: AMERICAN RESEARCH STAFF<br> FROM: Tokyo Office<br> DATE: January 5, 1991<br> RE: <i>My American Wife!</i>...<br> <p> Here is list of IMPORTANT THINGS for <i>My American Wife!</i><br> </p><p> DESIRABLE THINGS:<br> 1. Attractiveness, wholesomeness, warm personality<br> 2. Delicious meat recipe (NOTE: Pork and other meats is second class meats, so please remember this easy motto: "Pork is Possible, but Beef is Best!")<br> 3. Attractive, docile husband<br> 4. Attractive, obedient children<br> 5. Attractive, wholesome lifestyle<br> 6. Attractive, clean house...<br> </p><p> UNDESIRABLE THINGS:<br> 1. Physical imperfections<br> 2. Obesity<br> 3. Squalor<br> 4. Second class peoples<br> </p></blockquote> <p> The series, <i>My American Wife!</i>, initally seems like a dream come true for Jane as she criss-crosses the United States filming a different American family each week for her Japanese audience. Naturally, the emphasis is on meat, and Ozeki has fun with out-there recipes such as rump roast in coke and beef fudge; but as Jane becomes more familiar with her subject, she becomes increasingly aware of the beef industry's widespread practice of using synthetic estrogens on their cattle and determines to sabotage the program. </p><p> Cut to Tokyo where Akiko Ueno struggles through the dull misery of life with her brutish husband, who happens to be in charge of the show's advertising. After seeing one of Jane's subversive episodes about a vegetarian lesbian couple, Akiko gets in touch and the two women plot to expose the meat industry's hazardous practices. Romance, humor, intrigue, and even a message--<i>My Year of Meats</i> has it all. This is a book that even a vegetarian would love.</p><b>Ruth Ozeki</b> is a novelist, filmmaker, and Zen Buddhist priest.

She was a Paiute princess and a major figure in the history of Nevada; her tribe still resides primarily in the state. <i>Life Among the Piutes</i> deals with Winnemucca's life and the plight of the Paiute Indians. <i>Life Among the Piutes</i> is Winnemucca's powerful legacy to both white and Paiute cultures. Following the oral tradition of Native American people, she reaches out to readers with a deeply personal appeal for understanding. She also records historical events from a unique perspective. She managed to record the Native American viewpoint of whites settling the West, told in a language that was not her own and by a woman during the time when even white women were not allowed to vote. Sarah Winnemucca dedicated her life to improving the living and social conditions for her people. She gave more than 400 speeches across the United States and Europe to gain support for the Paiutes. She died of tuberculosis in 1891. <i>Life Among the Piutes</i> was originally published in 1883.</p></p><p><b>Sarah Winnemucca</b> (1844?-1891), a granddaughter of Paiute Chief Truckee and daughter of Chief Winnemucca, was born in the Humboldt River-Pyramid Lake region at a time of great change for the Northern Paiute Nation.Her experiences with the U.S. Government, losing relatives during the 1878 Bannock War, and the forced relocation of the Northern Paiute people to various reservations compelled Winnemucca to give more than 400 speeches to gain support for the Paiutes.In 1993, Winnemucca was inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame. In 1994, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.<br>&#x201c;For students of Western American history, this book is invaluable. Rarely do we have firsthand accounts of events of such importance; even more rarely are these accounts written by Native Americans who participated in them; and, still rarer are the accounts written by Native American women.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Journal of the West</i></p><h2>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (The World&#39;s Best Reading)</h2><p>Pleasantville, New York: Reader&#39;s Digest, 1988. Hardbound, 9.25 inches tall, 256 pages. From the Reader&#39;s Digest World&#39;s Best Reading series. Illustrations by Sergio Martinez; afterword by George Fletcher. Contents: Silver Blaze; The Cardboard Box; The Yellow Face; The Stockbroker&#39;s Clerk; The Gloria Scott; The Musgrave Ritual; The Reigate Squires; The Crooked Man; The Resident Patient; The Greek Interpreter; The Naval Treaty; and The Final Problem.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, February 2000</b>: What is there about the greatest series of short stories in the history of the world that hasn't already been said? This is the second (of five) story collections by Doyle about the greatest detective in literature--and a splendid volume it is, containing such superb puzzles as "The Greek Interpreter," in which readers are introduced to Mycroft Holmes; "The Musgrave Ritual"; "Silver Blaze"; and the earth-shattering "The Final Adventure," recounting the struggle between Holmes and the evil Professor Moriarty in which the two titans were apparently killed as they went over the edge of the Reichenbach Falls. <p> But every mystery reader already knows this. I'm pointing out this marvelous book because it has been extensively annotated by a fine Sherlockian scholar, Les Klinger, who has brought to all serious students of the Holmesian canon a level of erudition seldom encountered. In addition to the expected illustrations from <i>The Strand</i> magazine and meticulous scrutiny of chronological evidence of various events, there are references to primary sources and a staggering helping of information from the thousands of works about Sherlock Holmes by others. </p><p>More than 30 years ago, another great Sherlockian scholar, William S. Baring-Gould, produced a ground-breaking volume that enjoyed more than 35 printings in its original two-volume format and probably sold just as many copies in a slightly less elaborate one-volume size. <i>The Annotated Sherlock Holmes</i> became the single most essential volume in the library of any true Sherlockian, of which the world has far more than you think.</p><p> Les Klinger has acknowledged Baring-Gould in every way imaginable, and it was an act of extraordinary courage to attempt to supercede that monumental work. But that is exactly what he appears to be doing. The first volume, his annotated edition of <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, was introduced by the same publisher last year. There are seven yet to come. </p><p> If you want to master just about everything there is to know about The Great Detective and The Good Doctor, to understand what Holmes meant when he referred to "a comet vintage" of wine, and to know what discrepancies there are between the English and American editions of the works, plus a thousand other things relating to Holmes, Watson, and the England of the Victorian era, you must have this volume, as well as all the others in the series as they become available over the next few years. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, she draws on her deep knowledge of the court's history and of its written and unwritten rules to show readers how the Supreme Court really works. <br><br> Greenhouse offers a fascinating institutional biography of a place and its people--men and women who exercise great power but whose names and faces are unrecognized by many Americans and whose work often appears cloaked in mystery. How do cases get to the Supreme Court? How do the justices go about deciding them? What special role does the chief justice play? What do the law clerks do? How does the court relate to the other branches of government? Greenhouse answers these questions by depicting the justices as they confront deep constitutional issues or wrestle with the meaning of confusing federal statutes. Throughout, the author examines many individual Supreme Court cases to illustrate points under discussion, ranging from <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>, the seminal case which established judicial review, to the recent <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em> (2008), which struck down the District of Columbia's gun-control statute and which was, surprisingly, the first time in its history that the Court issued an authoritative interpretation of the Second Amendment. To add perspective, Greenhouse also compares the Court to foreign courts, revealing interesting differences. For instance, no other country in the world has chosen to bestow life tenure on its judges. <br> <br> A superb overview packed with telling details, this volume offers a matchless introduction to one of the pillars of American government.<br></p><p><br><strong>Linda Greenhouse</strong> was the <em>New York Times</em> Supreme Court correspondent for 30 years, covering thousands of decisions written by 18 different justices.

Over recent years I have been able to learn from some of America&#x2019;s most inspirational teachers and their students, and to work alongside visionary friends and colleagues who have broadened and enriched my thinking. I am deeply grateful to many people in California, particularly at Stanford University and in Bay Area schools, who made this book possible.</p><p>This book was conceived at a very special place: the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in California, a place devoted to the generation of ideas. I had given a presentation to the other fellows at the center, a group of scholars who worked in different areas of social science research, on the results of my studies of mathematics learning. The group responded strongly, with expressions of shock and dismay, and they urged me to get my results out to the general public. They convinced me to write a book proposal for a broader audience and many people&#x2014;in particular Susan Shirk, Sam Popkin, and David Clark&#x2014;supported me along the way.</p><p>From that point I was greatly encouraged by my agent Jill Marsal and Kathryn Court, of Penguin Books, both of whom believed in the book, which meant a lot to me. I wrote the book in the stimulating environment of Stanford&#x2019;s Graduate School of Education, surrounded by a group of graduate students who served as critics and supporters. I would personally like to thank all of my doctoral students, past and present, who contributed to the mathematics education group at Stanford. </p><p>I have learned a great deal from some truly inspirational teachers in recent years&#x2014;among them Cathy Humphreys, Carlos Cabana, Sandie Gilliam, Estelle Woodbury, and Ruth Parker. They change students&#x2019; lives on a daily basis and I am privileged to have been able to work with them and learn from them. Cathy is a good friend who has helped me in many ways. I am also deeply grateful to the students of Railside, Greendale, Hilltop, Amber Hill, and Phoenix Park schools; they all gave me their honest and insightful feedback on their mathematics learning experiences and they are the reason that I wrote this book.</p><p>I am fortunate to have had some great teachers of my own in my life&#x2014;including Professors Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam, both of whom encouraged me in important ways at an early point in my academic career and kindly read chapters of this book for me. Professor Leone Burton, one of my strongest supporters, will be greatly missed by many people. Most of all I would like to thank my two daughters, Jaime and Ariane, for putting up with me when I lock myself away to write!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Preface to the New Edition</p><p>Introduction</p><p>In 2008, when What&#x2019;s Math Got to Do with It? was first published, the United States was in the grip of endless multiple-choice testing and widespread math failure, brain research was in its infancy, and a group of traditional mathematicians was working tirelessly to stop school reforms. Fast-forward to 2015 and the landscape has changed with the emergence of incredible new research on the brain and learning, which is being acknowledged and acted upon. The White House has convened numerous meetings over the past few years where researchers, myself included, have talked about mathematics, mind-set, and equity. The traditional mathematicians have lost their voice, and many more people are receptive to the idea of a future in which all children can learn mathematics to high levels. These changes pave the way for the creation of mathematics classrooms in which students are excited to learn and teachers are armed with the most important knowledge that inspires students to achieve excellence in math.</p><p>I love books. I enjoy reading and writing them, but the Internet has helped me to achieve something that is very important to my long-term professional mission. In the summer of 2013, I tried an experiment. A few months earlier I had been introduced to Sebastian Thrun, an amazing man who invented self-driving cars, led Google teams developing Google Maps and Google Glass, and is the CEO of Udacity. The world of free online courses, or MOOCs (massive open online courses), is generally attributed to Sebastian and his colleague Peter Norvig, who is the director of research at Google. Sebastian and Peter decided to put one of Sebastian&#x2019;s Stanford computer science courses online. One hundred sixty thousand people registered for the course, and the MOOC world began. Sebastian went on to create Udacity, an online-course provider, and some months later asked me to help with course design. The time I spent at Udacity was enough to give me the knowledge I needed to design my own course. Putting knowledge about the brain and math learning into the hands of our nation&#x2019;s teachers and parents would change everything and lent itself perfectly to online courses that could share information widely. I designed my courses to make them engaging and interactive, but the levels of interest in the classes surpassed my greatest hopes. To date more than 130,000 people&#x2014;teachers, parents, and students&#x2014;have taken my online courses entitled &#x201c;How to Learn Math,&#x201d; and they are now armed with the critical information that I will share in this book.</p><p>I took Udacity&#x2019;s idea that online courses should not be talking heads and adopted their principle that professors should not talk for more than two minutes before engaging the learners in a task. I didn&#x2019;t have much time, with a full-time job teaching at Stanford, researching, and looking after a large team of doctoral students, but I spent every spare moment on weekends and in the evenings creating my experimental course. The course appeared on Stanford&#x2019;s online platform in the summer of 2013 but was not advertised in any way. The course opened with approximately five thousand registrants, but word of mouth spread quickly, and by the time the course finished at the end of the summer more than forty thousand teachers and parents had enrolled. Many MOOCs have high enrollment, but generally only a small proportion of the people who register end up taking the courses. This was not the case with my course, and an impressive 63 percent of people completed most of the course. Even more rewardingly, at the end of the course 95 percent of teachers and parents said that they would change their teaching/parenting as a result of the ideas they had learned in the class. In the months after my class, news of the ideas spread, hundreds of videos were posted to YouTube, my in-box was flooded, and requests for speaking engagements increased. So many teachers and parents asked for continued access to the new ideas that Cathy Williams and I launched YouCubed. YouCubed initially was a nonprofit company but now is a center at Stanford. In the summer of 2014, I published a new online course getting the same powerful ideas straight to students, and within a few months of the course opening eighty-five thousand students had taken the class or been shown the videos by their teachers.</p><p>I do not think that online courses are the most powerful medium for learning&#x2014;I would always rather interact with groups of learners face-to-face and have them discuss ideas with each other&#x2014;but online courses allow wide-scale access to important knowledge that urgently needs to be shared and that cannot depend on parents finding their way to high-quality teaching in their local area. I have been frustrated over the years by universities encouraging professors to publish research on learning only in academic journals, which are read by other academics and do not get to the people who need them&#x2014;teachers and parents. Important knowledge on ways to learn effectively is usually locked away in journals and libraries unless researchers choose to publish their findings in different, more accessible ways and universities do not penalize them for doing so. This is what motivated me to publish the first edition of What&#x2019;s Math Got to Do with It? and to update this edition with the latest research and practical information on ways to help all learners of mathematics.</p><p>When I wrote the original edition of What&#x2019;s Math Got to Do with It? the field of mathematics education had a large body of research on ways to teach and learn mathematics well. We knew how to empower math learners, but the research was not getting to teachers or being used in classrooms. If you walk into most math classrooms in the United States, particularly at the high school level, you would think you had been transported into the Victorian age. For the most part teachers are still at the front of the room lecturing on methods, students are still at desks learning to calculate by hand, and the mathematics being taught is three-hundred-year-old mathematics that is not needed in the modern world.1 In elementary classrooms across the United States, students are turned away from mathematics on a daily basis by timed tests and speed competitions, which we know can cause the early onset of math anxiety for many students.2, 3, 4 We have the research knowledge to change this and for classrooms to become places where all students are inspired by mathematics. In the last decade, important new research on the brain and learning has emerged, which is critical for math teachers, math learners, and parents everywhere.</p><p>Mind-set and Mathematics</p><p>In 2006, a trade book appeared on bookshelves that ultimately would have one of the biggest impacts of any research volume ever published in education. In Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, Stanford Professor Carol Dweck summarized key findings from her research on the nature and impact of mind-sets. The book quickly became a New York Times bestseller ...</p></p><h2>Moving Into English: Student Edition Grade 3 2005</h2><p>This student edition is an anthology composed of a variety of reading selections, encompassing many genres.

Covey presents a holistic, integrated, principle-centered approach for solving personal and professional problems. With penetrating insights and pointed anecdotes, Covey reveals a step-by-step pathway for living with fairness, integrity, service, and human dignity -- principles that give us the security to adapt to change and the wisdom and power to take advantage of the opportunities that change creates.</p><p>Anyone who thinks the audiocassette adaptation of Stephen Covey's bestseller, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, is a shortcut to reading the book has another thing coming. As a preview, the cassette is worth every one of its 90 minutes; as a substitute for the original, it will only leave you wishing for the rest. There's a reason <i>7 Habits</i> has sold more than 5 million copies and been translated into 32 languages. Serious work has obviously gone into it, and serious change can likely come out of it--but only with constant discipline and steadfast commitment. As the densely packed tape makes immediately clear, this is no quick fix for what's ailing us in our personal and professional lives.<p> The tape opens to the silky-smooth, overtrained voice of the female narrator, who's responsible for tying together audio clips from actual Covey seminars. Leaving aside the occasional attempts at promoting Covey and his institute, her script does a first-rate job of making sense of Covey's own intense, analogy-rich style of explaining his habits. There's nothing simple about his approach to becoming an effective person. The first three habits alone--which have to do with personal responsibility, leadership, and self-management--could take years to master. Yet the last four are unattainable, the narrator insists, if you can't acquire the personal security--the "inner core," says Covey--that presumably comes from a mastery of the foundation.</p><p> Throughout our lessons, Covey's presence is both learned and thoroughly appealing. He drops references to the likes of Socrates, T.S. Eliot, and Robert Frost with the aplomb of an English professor. And his knack for mixing everyday stories with abstract concepts manages to clarify difficult issues while respecting our intelligence. You could argue that the cassette is nothing more than a clever marketing tool for selling another few million copies of the book. But, even at that, it's worth the investment in time and concentration: in the end, we're moved to learn more about integrating all seven habits in our struggle to become better and, yes, more effective people. (Running time: 1.5 hours, one cassette) <i>--Ann Senechal</i></p><i>The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People</i> is a comprehensive program based on developing an awareness of how perceptions and assumptions hinder success---in business as well as presonal relationships. Here's an approach that will help broaden your way of thinking and lead to greater opportunities and effective problem solving. Be Pro-Active: Take the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Begin With an End in Mind: Start with a clear destination to understand where you are now, where you're going and what you value most. Put First Things First: Manage yourself. Organize and execute around priorities. Think Win/Win: See life as a cooperative, not a comprehensive arena where success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Seek First to Understand: Understand then be understood to build the skills of empathetic listening that inspires openness and trust. Synergize: Apply the principles of cooperative creativity and value differences. Renewal: Preserving and enhanving your greatest asset, yourself, by renewing the physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional dimensions of your nature. Stephen R. Covey is the most respected motivator in the business world today.

This decision began a key facet of independence.<br><br>Slave Nation is a fascinating account of the role slavery played in the drawing of the United States Constitution and in shaping the United States. At the Constitutional Convention, the South feared that the Northern states would leave the Convention over the issue of slavery. In a compromise, the Southern states agreed to slavery's prohibition north of the Ohio River, resulting in the Northwest Ordinance. This early national division would continue to escalate, eventually only reaching resolution through the Civil War.</p><p>This chilling history describes how a decision in the High Court of London in 1772 freeing a British slave so terrified the southern slaveholders that ironically they joined the American Revolution and the battle for freedom to ensure the preservation of slavery itself. Slave Nation offers a radically different view of the profound role that slavery played in the founding of the Republic through the creation of the Constitution.<br><br>&#x201c;Not your typical history of the American Revolution.

They looked ahead, seeing nothing but another hillock to climb, and after that a thousand more, and it was as if the camel despaired at the thought. Its forelegs folded, then its rear went down, and it couched on top of the hill like a monument, staring across the empty desert with the indifference of the dying.</p><p>The man hauled on its nose rope. Its head came forward and its neck stretched out, but it would not get up. The man went behind and kicked its hindquarters as hard as he could, three or four times. Finally he took out a razor-sharp curved Bedouin knife with a narrow point and stabbed the camel&#x2019;s rump. Blood flowed from the wound but the camel did not even look around.</p><p>The man understood what was happening. The very tissues of the animal&#x2019;s body, starved of nourishment, had simply stopped working, like a machine that has run out of fuel. He had seen camels collapse like this on the outskirts of an oasis, surrounded by life-giving foliage which they ignored, lacking the energy to eat.</p><p>There were two more tricks he might have tried. One was to pour water into its nostrils until it began to drown; the other to light a fire under its hindquarters. He could not spare the water for one nor the firewood for the other, and besides neither method had a great chance of success.</p><p>It was time to stop, anyway. The sun was high and fierce. The long Saharan summer was beginning, and the midday temperature would reach 110 degrees in the shade.</p><p>Without unloading the camel, the man opened one of his bags and took out his tent. He looked around again, automatically: there was no shade or shelter in sight&#x2014;one place was as bad as another. He pitched his tent beside the dying camel, there on top of the hillock.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in the open end of the tent to make his tea. He scraped level a small square of sand, arranged a few precious dry twigs in a pyramid and lit the fire. When the kettle boiled he made tea in the nomad fashion, pouring it from the pot into the cup, adding sugar, then returning it to the pot to infuse again, several times over. The resulting brew, very strong and rather treacly, was the most revivifying drink in the world.</p><p>He gnawed at some dates and watched the camel die while he waited for the sun to pass overhead. His tranquillity was practiced. He had come a long way in this desert, more than a thousand miles. Two months earlier he had left El Agela, on the Mediterranean coast of Libya, and traveled due south for five hundred miles, via Gialo and Kufra, into the empty heart of the Sahara. There he had turned east and crossed the border into Egypt unobserved by man or beast. He had traversed the rocky wasteland of the Western Desert and turned north near Kharga: and now he was not far from his destination. He knew the desert, but he was afraid of it&#x2014;all intelligent men were, even the nomads who lived all their lives here. But he never allowed that fear to take hold of him, to panic him, to use up his nervous energy. There were always catastrophes: mistakes in navigation that made you miss a well by a couple of miles; water bottles that leaked or burst; apparently healthy camels that got sick a couple of days out. The only response was to say <i>Inshallah</i>: It is the will of God.</p><p>Eventually the sun began to dip toward the west. He looked at the camel&#x2019;s load, wondering how much of it he could carry. There were three small European suitcases, two heavy and one light, all important. There was a little bag of clothes, a sextant, the maps, the food and the water bottle. It was already too much: he would have to abandon the tent, the tea set, the cooking pot, the almanac and the saddle.</p><p>He made the three cases into a bundle and tied the clothes, the food and the sextant on top, strapping the lot together with a length of cloth. He could put his arms through the cloth straps and carry the load like a rucksack on his back. He slung the goatskin water bag around his neck and let it dangle in front.</p><p>It was a heavy load.</p><p>Three months earlier he would have been able to carry it all day then play tennis in the evening, for he was a strong man; but the desert had weakened him. His bowels were water, his skin was a mass of sores, and he had lost twenty or thirty pounds. Without the camel he could not go far.</p><p>Holding his compass in his hand, he started walking.</p><p>He followed the compass wherever it led, resisting the temptation to divert around the hills, for he was navigating by dead reckoning over the final miles, and a fractional error could take him a fatal few hundred yards astray. He settled into a slow, long-strided walk. His mind emptied of hopes and fears and he concentrated on the compass and the sand. He managed to forget the pain of his ravaged body and put one foot in front of the other automatically, without thought and therefore without effort.</p><p>The day cooled into evening. The water bottle became lighter around his neck as he consumed its contents. He refused to think about how much water was left: he was drinking six pints a day, he had calculated, and he knew there was not enough for another day. A flock of birds flew over his head, whistling noisily. He looked up, shading his eyes with his hand, and recognized them as Lichtenstein&#x2019;s sandgrouse, desert birds like brown pigeons that flocked to water every morning and evening. They were heading the same way as he was, which meant he was on the right track, but he knew they could fly fifty miles to water, so he could take little encouragement from them.</p><p>Clouds gathered on the horizon as the desert cooled. Behind him, the sun sank lower and turned into a big yellow balloon. A little later a white moon appeared in a purple sky.</p><p>He thought about stopping. Nobody could walk all night. But he had no tent, no blanket, no rice and no tea. And he was sure he was close to the well: by his reckoning he should have been there.</p><p>He walked on. His calm was deserting him now. He had set his strength and his expertise against the ruthless desert, and it began to look as if the desert would win. He thought again of the camel he had left behind, and how it had sat on the hillock, with the tranquillity of exhaustion, waiting for death. He would not wait for death, he thought: when it became inevitable he would rush to meet it. Not for him the hours of agony and encroaching madness&#x2014;that would be undignified. He had his knife.</p><p>The thought made him feel desperate, and now he could no longer repress the fear. The moon went down, but the landscape was bright with starlight. He saw his mother in the distance, and she said: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say I never warned you!&#x201d; He heard a railway train that chugged along with his heartbeat, slowly. Small rocks moved in his path like scampering rats. He smelled roast lamb. He breasted a rise and saw, close by, a red glow of the fire over which the meat had been roasted, and a small boy beside it gnawing the bones. There were the tents around the fire, the hobbled camels grazing the scattered thorns, and the wellhead beyond. He walked into the hallucination. The people in the dream looked up at him, startled. A tall man stood up and spoke. The traveler pulled at his howli, partially unwinding the cloth to reveal his face.</p><p>The tall man stepped forward, shocked, and said, &#x201c;My cousin!&#x201d;</p><p>The traveler understood that this was not, after all, an illusion; and he smiled faintly and collapsed.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>When he awoke he thought for a moment that he was a boy again, and that his adult life had been a dream.</p><p>Someone was touching his shoulder and saying, &#x201c;Wake up, Achmed,&#x201d; in the tongue of the desert. Nobody had called him Achmed for years. He realized he was wrapped in a coarse blanket and lying on the cold sand, his head swathed in a howli. He opened his eyes to see the gorgeous sunrise like a straight rainbow against the flat black horizon. The icy morning wind blew into his face. In that instant he experienced again all the confusion and anxiety of his fifteenth year.</p><p>He had felt utterly lost, that first time he woke up in the desert. He had thought, <i>My father is dead</i>, and then, <i>I have a new father</i>. Snatches from the Surahs of the Koran had run through his head, mixed with bits of the Creed which his mother still taught him secretly, in German. He remembered the recent sharp pain of his adolescent circumcision, followed by the cheers and rifle shots of the men as they congratulated him on at last becoming one of them, a true man. Then there had been the long train journey, wondering what his desert cousins would be like, and whether they would despise his pale body and his city ways. He had walked briskly out of the railway station and seen the two Arabs, sitting beside their camels in the dust of the station yard, wrapped in traditional robes which covered them from head to foot except for the slit in the howli which revealed only their dark, unreadable eyes. They had taken him to the well. It had been terrifying: nobody had spoken to him, except in gestures. In the evening he had realized that these people had <i>no toilets,</i> and he became desperately embarrassed. In the end he had been forced to ask. There was a moment of silence, then they all burst out laughing. It transpired that they had thought he could not speak their language, which was why everyone had tried to communicate with him in signs; and that he had used a baby word in asking about toilet arrangements, which made it funnier. Someone had explained to him about walking a little way beyond the circle of tents and squatting in the sand, and after that he had not been so frightened, for although these were hard men they were not unkind.</p><p>All these thoughts had run through his mind as he looked at his first desert sunrise, and they ...</p></p><h2>New York City Neighborhoods: The 18th Century (Foundations of Archaeology)</h2><p>An archaeological study of the growth of Manhattan during the colonial period, this book documents the emergence of Manhattan as the center of class-structured capitalist commercialism in the new nation-state.

Along the way, they experienced firsthand dozens of varieties of rice, offering unimaginable subtleties of taste, as well as a staggering array of foods to accompany them, all providing a simple way to get flavor and variety on the table.<p><i>Seductions of Rice</i> is the glorious result: two hundred easy-to-prepare dishes from the world's great rice cuisines, illuminated by stories, insights, and more than two hundred photographs of people, places, and wonderful food.

To say that Alford and Duguid, authors of the award-winning <i>Flatbreads and Flavors</i>, deliver the world of rice is much too simple an understatement. Your days of buying one rice to serve all purposes will end with even a cursory reading of this lovely book. <p> The authors are photographers as well as writers, but their greatest skill may be to travel the world at the level of the culture they visit. They seem able to drop away from Western culture and hunker right down with rice vendor or cook, no matter where. </p><p> <i>Seductions of Rice</i> opens with all the basics of rice, everything a reader would want to know and then some. Then on to the cultures of rice: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Central Asian, Mediterranean, Senegalese, and North American. Recipes either made from rice or to accompany rice range from Chinese Congee to Thai Green Papaya Salad to Japanese Quick Morning Miso Soup to South Indian Lentil Stew to Cuban Black Beans to Mexican Green Rice.</p><p> And in between? The authors fill in all the space between these diverse grains of rice with traveler's tales from the road. It is a luxurious book, a delicious book, a ripe combination of travel and taste. You leave off thinking that the world must be the shape of a rice ball. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>IN 1995 Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Dunguid published a cookbook that defined a new genre. "The first of its kind," raved The Boston Globe. "If you buy only one cookbook this year, make it Flatbreads and Flavors" (USA Today); "a certifiable publishing event" (Vogue); "a rich and rare effort" (The New York Time). It received not one, but both major cookbook awards the year it was published.<p> And now, they're done it again. That depth of passion and experience and the unique ability to convey richness of place and taste that the authors brought to Flatbreads and Flavors, they bring to Seductions of Rice: an essential book about the world's most essential food.</p><p> Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid traveled to the major rice-eating regions of the world and experience firsthand dozens of varieties of rice with unimaginable subtleties of taste, as well as the staggering array of foods that traditionally accompany them. In Seductions of Rice, they bring it all home--hundreds of delectable dishes from the world's greatest rice cuisines, illuminated by stories, insights, and photographs. Chinese stir-fries served with steaming rice, smoky Carolina low-country pulaos, Japanese sushi, Indian thorans, Thai salads, Turkish pilafs, Italian risottos are shared not just as recipes, but as time-honored traditions.</p><p> But Seductions of Rice is more than a collection of fabulous recipes surrounded by a wealth of precious information. It is more than an enthralling journey with photographs--taken by the authors--of peoples and places, many of which we can barely imagine. It is a "new" way of putting food on the table that is as old as the ages.</p><p> You will marvel at how food this simple can taste this good and be so satisfying--Thai sticky rice with grilled beef salad, Indian basmati with curry, Cuban black beans and rice, Louisiana gumbo, Persian kebabs with saffron-tintted rice, Spanish paella, Mexican rice pudding. Hundreds of recipes from around the world attest to the adaptablilty of this endlessly appealing food. Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid understand our yen for these vibrant flavors and have writtten a book that satisfies our every craving.</p></p><h2>Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States</h2><p>The first edition of this best-selling book showed that alongside the subtle forms of discrimination typical of the post-Civil Rights era, new powerful ideology of "color-blind racism" has emerged. Bonilla-Silva documented how beneath the rhetorical maze of contemporary racial discourse lies a full-blown arsenal of arguments, phrases, and stories that whites use to account for and ultimately justify racial inequities.<br><br>In the new edition Bonilla-Silva has added a chapter dealing with the future of racial stratification in America that goes beyond the white / black dichotomy. He argues that the U.S. is developing a more complex and apparently "plural" racial order that will mimic Latin American patterns of racial stratification. Another new chapter addresses a variety of questions from readers of the first edition. And he has updated the book throughout with new information, data, and references where appropriate. The book ends with a new Postscript, "What is to be Done (For Real?)". As in the highly acclaimed first edition, Bonilla-Silva continues to challenge color-blind thinking.</p><p><b>Eduardo Bonilla-Silva</b> is research professor of sociology at Duke University.Quick, fast-paced, and critical, Eduardo Bonilla-Silva's insightful analysis provides an important critique of those who want to shift explanations of racial disparities from racism to cultural deficiencies.

But until now, Catholics interested in their faith have been hard-pressed to find an accessible, affirmative, and exciting history of the Church.<br><i>Triumph</i> is that history. Inside, you'll discover the spectacular story of the Church from Biblical times and the early days of St. Peter&#x2014;the first pope&#x2014;to the twilight years of John Paul II. It is a sweeping drama of Roman legions, great crusades, epic battles, toppled empires, heroic saints, and enduring faith. And, there are stormy controversies: Dark Age skullduggery, the Inquistition, the Renaissance popes, the Reformation, the Church's refusal to accept sexual liberation and contemporary allegations like those made in <i>Hitler's Pope</i> and <i>Papal Sin.</i><br>A brawling, colorful history full of inspiring pageantry and spirited polemic, <i>Triumph</i> will exhilarate, amuse, and infuriate as it extols the glories of Catholic history and the gripping stories of its greatest men and women.</p><p>Catholics who tire of histories critical of their church will find much to love in <i>Triumph</i>, by the journalist and novelist H.W. Crocker III. With the enthusiasm of a convert, Crocker (formerly an Anglican) tells a story spanning 2,000 years, concentrating on the most heroic and adventurous chapters of church history. Crocker writes clear, crisp sentences ("Origen severed his genitals," begins one chapter; "A little looting goes a long way," opens another), and his version of Catholic history is one amazing scene after another. <i>Triumph</i> reads more like a historical novel than most other church histories, and that quality makes the book one of the most accessible historical surveys for younger readers. Theologically, however, Crocker is so eager to depict the church in a positive light that he's all but blind to its flaws. There's a lot of catechism here, but not much probing into the complexities of the church's involvement in the Inquisition or in World War II, or contemporary controversies such as the ordination of women. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"Mr.Crocker's book is engaging, provocative, and eminently readable. It should be around for Vatican III."&#x2014;<b>William F. Buckley Jr.</b><br>"Harry Crocker propels us through two millennia with wit and insight.

Fleur Pillager takes her mother's name, Four Souls, for strength and walks from her Ojibwe reservation to the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. She is seeking restitution from and revenge on the lumber baron who has stripped her reservation. But revenge is never simple, and she quickly finds her intentions complicated by her own dangerous compassion for the man who wronged her.</p><p>The two narrators of <em>Four Souls</em> are from utterly different worlds. Nanapush, a "smart man and a fool," is both Fleur's savior and her conscience. He tells Fleur's story and tells his own. He would like a calm and discriminating love with his sweetheart, Margaret. He is old and would like to face death with his love beside him. Instead the two find themselves battling out their last years. When the childhood nemesis of Nanapush appears and casts his eye toward Margaret, Nanapush acts out an absurd revenge of his own and nearly ends up destroying everything. The other narrator, Polly Elizabeth Gheen, is a pretentious and vulnerable upper-crust fringe element, a hanger-on in a wealthy Minneapolis family, a woman aware of her precarious hold on those around her. To her own great surprise the entrance of Fleur Pillager into her household and her life effects a transformation she could never have predicted.</p><p>In the world of interconnected novels by Louise Erdrich, <em>Four Souls</em> is most closely linked to <em>Tracks</em>. All these works continue and elaborate the intricate story of life on a reservation peopled by saints and false saints, heroes and sinners, clever fools and tenacious women. Four Souls reminds us of the deep spirituality and the ordinary humanity of this world, and is as beautiful and lyrical as anything Louise Erdrich has written.</p><p>Louise Erdrich is the author of fifteen novels as well as volumes of poetry, children&#x2019;s books, short stories, and a memoir of early motherhood.

On the few on which it can be found, Plum Island is marked red or yellow, and stamped U.S. government&#x2014;restricted or dangerous animal diseases. Though many people live the good life within a scant mile or two from its shores, few know the name of this pork chop&#x2013;shaped island. Even fewer can say whether it is inhabited, or why it doesn't exist on the map. That's all about to change.</p><p><em>Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory</em> blows the lid off the stunning true nature and checkered history of Plum Island. It shows that the seemingly bucolic island on the edge of the largest population center in the United States is a ticking biological time bomb that none of us can safely ignore.</p><p>Based on innumerable declassified government documents, scores of in-depth interviews, and access to Plum Island itself, this is an eye-opening, suspenseful account of a federal government germ laboratory gone terribly wrong. For the first time, <em>Lab 257</em> takes you deep inside this secret world and presents startling revelations including virus outbreaks, biological meltdowns, infected workers who were denied assistance in diagnosis by Plum Island brass, the periodic flushing of contaminated raw sewage into area waters, and the insidious connections between Plum Island, Lyme disease, and the deadly 1999 West Nile virus outbreak.</p><p>An exploration of the complex world of microbiology, viruses, and bacteria, <em>Lab 257</em> also shows how the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which ran Plum Island for the last half century, is far more than wholesome grade-A eggs and the food pyramid. The book probes what's in store for Plum Island's new owner, the Department of Homeland Security, in this age of bioterrorism. And for those interested in questions of national security and safety, it is a call to action for those concerned with protecting present and future generations from preventable biological catastrophes.</p><p><em>Lab 257</em> will change forever our current understanding of Plum Island -- a place that is, in the words of one insider, "a biological Three Mile Island."</p></p><p>That the United States government engaged in dangerous biological research during World War II will come as no surprise to Americans jaded by revelations of secret medical experiments and radiation exposures. But that the accident-plagued facility where it happened--and continues to happen--is just off the coast of Long Island may alarm many readers of Michael Christopher Carroll's <i>Lab 257</i>. Carroll, an attorney by trade, gamely takes on complex microbiology and shady government record-keeping in telling the story of Plum Island, home of the Animal Disease Center--no place for a casual picnic. The lab, initially set up by the Army to research ways of destroying Soviet farm animals (and to keep them from destroying ours), has often dealt with bacteria and viruses that can be passed from animals to humans. Carroll draws compelling causal links between Plum Island and the introduction of Lyme disease, West Nile virus, and duck enteritis, all non-native germs that wreaked sudden havoc in North America, and all germs that Plum Island scientists were allegedly working with. With hurricanes and terrorists on his mind, Carroll asks readers to imagine a scenario in which the Plum Island lab might release pathogens into the most densely populated area in the country. He ends the book with two chilling questions. First, does the United States need a research facility that investigates animal pathogens with potential for human transmission?

In all these years, the United States has never charged him with a crime. Although he was ordered released by a federal judge, the U.S. government fought that decision, and there is no sign that the United States plans to let him go.<br><br>Three years into his captivity Slahi began a diary, recounting his life before he disappeared into U.S. custody and daily life as a detainee. His diary is not merely a vivid record of a miscarriage of justice, but a deeply personal memoir---terrifying, darkly humorous, and surprisingly gracious. Published now for the first time, GUANT�NAMO DIARY is a document of immense historical importance.</p><p><strong>Mohamedou Slahi</strong> was born in a small town in Mauritania in 1970. He won a scholarship to attend college in Germany and worked there for several years as an engineer. He returned to Mauritania in 2000. The following year, at the behest of the United States, he was detained by Mauritanian authorities and rendered to a prison in Jordan; later he was rendered again, first to Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan, and finally, on August 5, 2002, to the U.S. prison at Guant�namo Bay, Cuba, where he was subjected to severe torture. He was cleared and released on October 16th of 2016 and repatriated to his native country of Mauritania. No charges were filed against him during or after this ordeal.<br><br><strong>Larry Siems</strong> is a writer and human rights activist and for many years directed the Freedom to Write program at PEN American Center.

Yet over the years, most of these popular tales have undergone many transformations, as editors and storytellers have shortened and sentimentalized them, as well as slanted them to suit the demands of the time.<br> Now reissued, Iona and Peter Opie's magnificent <em>The Classic Fairy Tales</em>, presents twenty-four of the best-known fairy tales in their original written form. Drawing on years of expertise, the editors provide introductions to each fairy tale, tracing the development of each story and noting points of interest. We learn, for example, that in a 17th century version of "Sleeping Beauty", the prince actually raped the princess in her sleep. Goldilocks, it turns out, evolved from the little old woman of the original story into a young girl. Little Red Ridinghood was actually eaten by the wolf, and in an early version of the "Frog Prince," the princess had to sleep with the frog to free him from his spell.<br> With classic tales from the likes of Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen, and the works of such famous illustrators as Gustav Dore, Kate Greenaway, and George Cruikshank, <em>The Classic Fairy Tales</em> brings to life the charm and beauty of these timeless favorites.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors:</em><br> <strong>Iona Opie</strong> and her late husband Peter wrote and edited many books together, including <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes</em>, <em>The Oxford Nursery Rhyme Book</em>, <em>The Oxford Book of Children's Verse</em>, <em>The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren</em>, <em>The Singing Game</em>, and <em>Children's Games in Street and Playground</em>&gt;<br><br>"All ages will enjoy Iona and Peter Opie's collection of <em>The Classic Fairy Tales</em>."--<em>York County Coast Star</em><p></p><br>"Their most enjoyable book to date...For your money you get three books in one, the stories, the essays and the ample illustrations."--illiam Golding, <em>Listener</em><p></p><br>"A beautiful book...both charming and scholarly"--Paul Barker, <em>New Society</em><p></p><br>"Some wand must have been waved over the Opies to give them the brilliant idea for this book...A volume of extraordinary fascination and richness."--Edwin Morgan<p></p><br>"This is a book that everybody ought to possess."-- Richard Adams<p></p><br>"It is not possible to praise too highly <em>The Classic Fairy Tales</em>, selected, introduced, and annotated by the peerless scholars of children's literature Iona and Peter Opie."--<em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Contains 24 of the best-known fairy tales, dozens of absolutely entrancing illustrations, and a brilliant and extensive commentary by Iona and Peter Opie, the peerless anthologists who have given us the <em>Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes</em>."--<em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Trojan Odyssey (Dirk Pitt Adventure)</h2><p>Underwater adventurer Dirk Pitt and the NUMA crew are joined by his two grown children, fraternal twins whose existence he had been unaware, to investigate a black tide infesting the ocean off Nicaragua, a study complicated by the discovery of a mysterious artifact, a powerful storm, and an all-too-human conspiracy. 700,000 first printing.</p><p>Clive Cussler is the author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, most recently <i>The Spy</i> and <i>Lost Empire</i>.

S.S.R. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</h2><p>The classic novel from "America's best crime novelist" (<i>Time</i>), with a new introduction by Dennis Lehane<br><br>George V. Higgins's seminal crime novel is a down-and-dirty tale of thieves, mobsters, and cops on the mean streets of&nbsp;Boston. When small-time gunrunner Eddie Coyle is convicted on a felony, he's looking at three years in the pen--that is, unless he sells out one of his big-fish clients to the DA.&nbsp;But which of the many hoods, gunmen, and executioners whom he calls his friends should he send up the river? Told almost entirely in crackling dialogue by a vivid cast of lowlifes and detectives, <i>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</i> is one of the greatest crime novels ever written.<br></p><p>George V. Higgins&#39;s first novel is like a blast of Atlantic air; the Boston prosecutor virtually reinvents the language of the crime novel with his unique ability to breathe life into the dialogue of the smalltime hoodlum and hustler. Trying to pull off one final score, career crook Eddie Coyle finds himself squeezed out of shape by the people above and below him. The explosive conclusion is inevitable yet fascinating.6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Mooseltoe</h2><p>Moose thinks he has all his Christmas preparations taken care of, but at the last minute he must come up with a substitute for the Christmas tree.</p><p>This charming verse story, told in a singsong rhythm, stars a moose who is determined that his family's Christmas will be "perfectly perfect." Moose "shopped till he dropped. Check," and "baked tons of tins of cookies. Check,"--but in his haste he completely forgets to buy a Christmas tree. After a long, fruitless search in the snow on Christmas Eve, he finally has to do the heroic thing: stand in a corner and become the tree himself. The crayon illustrations by Henry Cole make much of Moose's endless handlebar "moostache." The rhymes may be rather forced for some tastes--"The kids tried to make the best of it. They said 'Oh so who needs a tree?' But Moose could plainly see they were short on the glee." But perhaps that's all just part of the amoosement value. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Ages 3-6. The moose with the amazing mustache, last seen in <i>Moostache </i> (1997), is getting ready for Christmas, and he's totally organized. Baking cookies, check; sending holiday cards, check; buying gifts, check, check, check. It doesn't become apparent until Christmas Eve that one important job has been left undone: there's no Christmas tree! So Moose makes the ultimate sacrifice for his family--he lets them hang tinsel and ornaments from his long mustache, wrap lights around his antlers, and stick a star on the top of his head. The telling is amusing but odd: in the middle of the story the words start to rhyme, though the text continues to be set down on the page as prose. Consequently, librarians will want to practice before reading this aloud to a group or they're sure to stumble. The cartoon-style watercolors, however, reminiscent of Lynn Munsinger's work, are both boisterous and droll. They're especially amusing whenever Moose and his moustache come into view. The dust jacket, featuring a bedecked, bemused Moose, will draw children into the story. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sundown towns can be found in almost every state.<br><br>"Don't let the sun go down on you in this town." We equate these words with the Jim Crow South but, in a sweeping analysis of American residential patterns, award-winning and bestselling author James W. Loewen demonstrates that strict racial exclusion was the norm in American towns and villages from sea to shining sea for much of the twentieth century.<br><br>Weaving history, personal narrative, and hard-nosed analysis, Loewen shows that the sundown town was&#x2014;and is&#x2014;an American institution with a powerful and disturbing history of its own, told here for the first time. In Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, sundown towns were created in waves of violence in the early decades of the twentieth century, and then maintained well into the contemporary era.<br><br><i>Sundown Towns</i> redraws the map of race relations, extending the lines of racial oppression through the backyard of millions of Americans&#x2014;and lobbing an intellectual hand grenade into the debates over race and racism today.</p><p><b>James W. Loewen</b> is the bestselling author of <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> (with combined hardcover and paperback sales of 600,000) and <i>Lies Across America</i>, both from The New Press, among many other books and articles. He is a regular contributor to the History Channel's <i>History</i> magazine. He is professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Vermont and lives in Washington, D.C.In Oct. 2001, James W. Loewen stopped at a convenience store in the small Illinois town of Anna -- a name that, as a store clerk confirmed, stands for "Ain't No Niggers Allowed."<p> On Nov. 8, 1909, nearly a century before Loewen stepped into the store, a mob of angry white citizens drove out Anna's 40 or so black families following the lynching in a nearby town of a black man accused of raping a white woman. Anna became all-white literally overnight, Loewen reports, and embraced racial exclusiveness for the long haul. According to the 2000 census, just one family with a black member lives among Anna's 7,000 residents. </p><p>Anna is far from unique, as Loewen, a sociologist, argues in his powerful and important new book, Sundown Towns. On the contrary, Loewen reports that -- beginning in roughly 1890 with the end of Reconstruction and continuing until the fair-housing legislation of the late 1960s -- whites in America created thousands of whites-only towns, commonly known as "sundown towns" owing to the signs often posted at their city limits that warned, as one did in Hawthorne, Calif., in the 1930s: "Nigger, Don't Let The Sun Set On YOU In Hawthorne." In fact, Loewen claims that, during that 70-year period, outside the traditional South, "probably a majority of all incorporated places [in the United States] kept out African Americans." </p><p>Such a bold claim would seem to require an exact count of sundown towns to back it up. But Loewen admits that the challenges of uncovering and confirming the existence of each sundown town -- when everything from census figures to local histories proved misleading -- limited his ability to nail down an exact figure. Instead, he writes, "I believe at least 3,000 and perhaps as many as 15,000 independent towns went sundown in the United States, mostly between 1890 and about 1930." </p><p>This vagueness, along with Loewen's almost evangelical passion for his material, raises questions of credibility -- or at least of potential overstatement. But Loewen expertly dodges those accusations. He devotes almost an entire chapter to explaining his research -- detailing his rationale for defining sundown towns, laying out his statistical methods and revealing how he triangulated oral history, written sources and census data to arrive at a "confirmation." So when he reports that he's personally verified the existence of roughly 1,000 sundown towns between 1890 and 1930, you believe him. And because he pairs that finding with an analysis of the history, causes and patterns of sundown towns that shows that they were, in many ways, as logical -- and often as violent -- an outgrowth of American racism as lynching, he ultimately makes a strong case that sundown towns were a significant feature of the American landscape. As is often the case when the subject is race, the relative lack of hard evidence ultimately becomes part of the story, rather than a hindrance to it.</p><p>As in Anna, whites in about 50 towns used mob violence to expel and keep out African Americans, and many more relied on the threat of violence, Loewen reports. Some towns, he writes, passed "legal" ordinances banning hiring blacks or renting or selling them homes; others relied on citizens to pay informal visits to warn visiting African Americans that they "must not remain in the town." In 1960, the press reported that realtors in Grosse Pointe, Mich., had conceived of an altogether more clinical way to insure racial exclusivity: a "point system" used to assess a potential buyer's eligibility that included a rating for swarthiness.</p><p> Often, Sundown Towns argues, a community used a variety of methods in order to remain all-white through the years. To demonstrate this, Loewen charts the course of segregation in Wyandotte, Mich.: In the early 1870s, whites there drove out a black barber; in 1881 and 1888, they expelled the town's black hotel workers; in 1907, four white men beat and robbed a black man at the train station; nine years later, a mob of white townspeople "bombarded" a boardinghouse, driving out all the African Americans and killing one. "In the 1940s," Loewen writes, "police arrested or warned African Americans for 'loitering suspiciously in the business district' or being in the park, and white children stoned African American children in front of Roosevelt High School." In the early 1950s, a University of Pennsylvania professor who grew up in Wyandotte told him, all the members of a black family who moved into town ended up dead. </p><p> If Loewen's first priority is to unveil what he calls the "hidden history" of sundown towns, his second is to debunk the widely held idea that when the issue is race, the South is always "the scene of the crime," as James Baldwin famously wrote. The incidence of sundown communities in the South, Loewen reports, was actually far lower than it was in a Midwestern state such as Illinois, in which roughly 70 percent of towns were sundown towns in 1970. "This does not make whites in the traditional South less racist than [those] in . . . other regions of the country," he suggests. </p><p> With the rise of the automobile, among other things, came the birth of sundown suburbs. In 1909, Loewen reports, Chevy Chase, Md., became one of the nation's first after the owner of the Chevy Chase Land Company sued a developer to whom it had sold a parcel of land because of rumors that he planned to build affordable housing for African American workers. The company ultimately prevented the development, and the land sat vacant for decades before becoming home to Saks Fifth Avenue, its current resident. No doubt, the owner of the Chevy Chase Land Company would approve of the suburb's current racial makeup; in 2000, Loewen writes, "its 6,183 residents included just 18 people living in families with at least one African American householder." But even that isn't white enough anymore, Loewen charges: Whites are increasingly fleeing nearly all-white suburbs for lily-white exurbs, adding sprawl to the already numerous economic, psychological and sociological tolls of residential segregation.</p><p>Much has been written about the history of segregation within American cities, but this is the first full-length study of places that sought to exclude African Americans entirely. Loewen's desire to be exhaustive is therefore understandable. But in this case, exhaustive sometimes means exhausting. The book would have been more enjoyable to read had Loewen focused in depth on a few representative sundown towns, teasing out the history and sociology of the phenomenon in a more narrative, less textbook-like form.</p><p>That said, for its meticulous research and passionate chronicling of the complex and often shocking history of whites-only communities, Sundown Towns deserves to become an instant classic in the fields of American race relations, urban studies and cultural geography. After reading it, you'll view your own community, and the whole of the American landscape, more suspiciously -- and rightly so. </p><p>Reviewed by Laura Wexler <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

Then other things got in the way&#x2014;her play, Lucky Guy; a movie script she was working on&#x2014;and it was set aside. Perhaps, too, knowing how ill she was, she began to see the book as a memorial and that made her uncomfortable&#x2014;she never said. But although I was aware of her dire medical situation, the original impulse behind the book was not to memorialize but to celebrate the richness of her work, the amazing arc of her career, and the place she had come to hold in the hearts of so many readers.<br><br> The reaction to her death was an outpouring of disbelief and grief. Before the publication of her two final collections&#x2014;I Feel Bad About My Neck and I Remember Nothing&#x2014;she was, of course, admired and enjoyed for both her writing and her movies, but the readership of these last books seemed to me to be on another level. It was personal. Her readers not only felt that they knew her but that she knew them. Obviously, not all the people&#x2014;more than a million of them!&#x2014;who bought Neck were women who identified with her or sensed her identification with them, but certainly many of them were. She had become a model, an ideal, or at the very least, an example&#x2014;she was telling them things about herself that were also about them, and giving them permission to think these things and feel these things. And she was also telling them what to look out for, what lay ahead. Her honesty and directness, and her unerring prescience, had made her a figure&#x2014;someone whose influence and authority transcended her individual achievements, extraordinary as they were.<br><br>In her later years, her movies brought her tremendous response and reward, both for their quality and because she was the first woman of her time to become a successful commercial film director. How did she do it? By her talent, naturally&#x2014;her uncanny ability to give us romance as seen through a gimlet eye. Some people complained that her movies were sentimental&#x2014;those happy endings! But those happy endings were actually realistic: She had lived one herself, through her long third marriage, one of the happiest marriages I&#x2019;ve ever witnessed.<br><br>The determination and persistence&#x2014;and clarity&#x2014;that saw her prevail in Hollywood were the qualities that earlier had propelled her to the heights of journalism, first as a reporter, then as an outspoken com- mentator. Her abiding principle was the reality principle. And of course she had a not-so-secret weapon: She was funny, even when she was furious; funny through thick and (as we know from Heartburn) thin. And she was openly and generously personal without being egotistical. She saw everything wryly, including herself. She also looked great.<br><br>This book is structured around the many genres and subjects she explored and conquered. As you&#x2019;ll see, it&#x2019;s autobiographical, sociological, political. It adds up to a portrait of a writer, a log of a writer&#x2019;s career, and an unofficial&#x2014;and unintended&#x2014;report on feminism in her time. She&#x2019;s a reporter, a profilist, a polemicist, a novelist, a screenwriter, a playwright, a memoirist, and a (wicked) blogger&#x2014;blogging came along just in time for her to lash out fiercely at the bad old days of Bush/ Cheney. And let&#x2019;s not forget that she was an obsessed foodie. Even her novel has recipes.<br><br>What was she like in real life? To begin with, she was a perfect spouse: She and her Nick could have given lessons to that earlier exemplary Nick-and-Nora, the Thin Man and the Thin Man&#x2019;s lady. She adored her two boys, and nobly tried not to micromanage them. (A real sacrifice: Managing things was one of her supreme talents&#x2014;and pleasures.) She was a fanatical friend, always there for anyone who needed support, encouragement, or kindness. She was also, I can report, a wonderfully responsive colleague. We worked together on all her books after her first collection, Wallflower at the Orgy, without a single moment of contention. As a result, I think I know what she would have wanted this book to be, and her family allowed me to shape it. My immedi- ate reward was having a professional excuse to reread everything she ever wrote. No other editorial job I&#x2019;ve ever performed has been so much fun.<br><br>A few notes on the text. Since almost all of this material has previ- ously appeared in print but in a variety of venues, we&#x2019;ve justified such technical matters as spelling and punctuation. There are some places (surprisingly few, actually) where, over the years, Nora repeated certain stories (sometimes with minor variations) or remade certain points&#x2014;as in her memories of her early role model, &#x201c;Jane.&#x201d; We&#x2019;ve left these as they originally appeared so that they can be read in context. The brilliant introduction she wrote for the published version of When Harry Met Sally . . . originally preceded the text of the script, but now it fol- lows it&#x2014;I felt it gave away too many of the surprises to come. The recipes&#x2014;she might not have been pleased&#x2014;remain untested.<br><br>&#x2014;Robert Gottlieb</p><h2>Bialosky&#39;s Christmas</h2><p>Bialosky plans a wonderful Christmas party and spends all day preparing for it, but he forgets to do one important thing.</p><p></p><h2>Bible Exposition Commentary, Vol. 1: New Testament</h2><p>Here is a commentary that doesn't read like a commentary but like letters from a good friend.

Rick Pyeritz and I were both family physicians and had practiced together for four years. Before moving to Bryson City in 1981, we had been family medicine residents together at Duke University Medical Center. &#39;What&#39;s up?&#39; I asked him. &#39;I need some help, partner. I&#39;m over in the ER sewing up a woman who stabbed herself several times. When the EMTs brought her in, she was hysterical, so I had to sedate her pretty heavily. Anyway, Don and Billy said she apparently murdered her husband in their home and then tried to do herself in. Since I&#39;m going to be here awhile, would you be willing to go to the crime scene and do the medical examiner&#39;s report?&#39; My heart began to beat a bit more quickly, as it always did when I received a call from the emergency room or a summons to the scene of a crime, and I suspected that the suspense of the unknown --- of the surprises one might find waiting --- would keep on giving me a sense of nervousness and trepidation every time a call came. Nevertheless, I tried to sound cool, calm, and collected. It&#39;s a skill doctors are taught early in their training. &#39;Be glad to help, Rick. Where&#39;s the house?&#39; &#39;It&#39;s up a hollow just off Deep Creek. Don and Billy are taking the ambulance back over there. They say you can follow them.&#39; &#39;Let me throw on some scrubs. Five minutes?&#39; &#39;I&#39;ll have them wait in their unit at the end of your driveway.&#39; &#39;Sounds good, Rick.&#39; I hung up the phone and walked to our bedroom to put on my scrubs. I smiled as I looked at the bedroom furniture I had given to Barb, my wife, for our tenth wedding anniversary over a year earlier. Right out of medical school in Durham, North Carolina, we had moved to this quaint little house in this charming village with our then nearly three-year-old daughter, Kate. Bryson City is the county seat of Swain County, in the heart of the Great Smoky Mountains. The county is spread over 550 square miles, yet in 1985 it only had about 8,000 residents. Less than a thousand people lived in the town. The population was small because the federal government owned 86 percent of the land --- and much of it was wilderness. Since pathology-trained coroners lived only in the larger towns, the non-pathologist doctors in the rural areas often became certified as coroners. We were not expected to do autopsies --- only pathologists were trained to perform these --- but we were expected to perform all of the non-autopsy responsibilities required of a medical examiner. Having obtained my training as a coroner while still in training at Duke, I knew the basics of determining the time and suspected cause of death, gathering medical evidence, and filling out the copious triplicate forms required by the state authorities. Not long after receiving the fancy certificate of competence from the state of North Carolina, I was required to put my new forensic skills to work. Through the subsequent years as a medical examiner, the work had become more routine, but never boring. After putting on my scrubs, I left our house, which was located across the street from the Swain County General Hospital, and jumped into our aging Toyota Corolla. Billy was in the driver&#39;s seat of the ambulance as I pulled up to the end of the driveway. He smiled and waved as he gunned the accelerator and disappeared behind the hospital and down the backside of Hospital Hill. I had no idea what awaited me at the murder scene, and I tried not to think about it as I followed the Swain County ambulance. Because medical examiners were required to gather medical evidence for all deaths that occurred outside the hospital, during my first four years in practice I was called on as a coroner in dozens of cases. Nevertheless, I still found my stomach in knots whenever I approached the scene of a crime or unexpected death. After observing the scene, determining the cause of death was usually straightforward, at least from a medical perspective. But every instance continued to remind me of the finality of death, helping me realize again that death almost always comes unexpectedly, without warning or opportunity for preparation. An even more troublesome aspect of my work as an ME, at least when exploring a murder scene, is that it was an unnerving reminder of people&#39;s inhumanity to people --- of the intrinsic evil that can potentially bubble out of any person&#39;s heart, even in an idyllic town I had come to love and call home. I followed the ambulance up the narrow dirt road into a small mountain hollow. It was a typical winter day in the Smokies --- gray, overcast, damp, dreary, and cold. Most who visit the Smokies in the spring and fall revel in its temperate and lush glory. But most aren&#39;t aware of how stiflingly hot and steamy the summers can be --- and virtually none know how dismal a Smoky Mountain winter can be. This day would prove to be far more dismal than most. As we reached the end of the road, I saw several sheriff vehicles in a small field in front of a diminutive white farmhouse surrounded with bright yellow crime scene tape. After parking and hopping out of the cab, Billy walked over and extended his hand. &#39;Howdy, Doc.&#39; &#39;Greetings, Billy.&#39; As Don walked up from behind the ambulance I nodded at him. &#39;It&#39;s a mess in thar, Doc,&#39; Don explained. &#39;What happened?&#39; &#39;On first look, it seems the woman stabbed her husband. She used a big ole butcher knife. Pretty much got him straight in the heart, at least judgin&#39; from all the blood on his chest and the floor. Then she turned the knife on herself.&#39; &#39;Cut her wrists?&#39; I asked, assuming a common method of suicide. &#39;Nope,&#39; Billy responded. &#39;First she cut her arm a couple of times, and then she tried to stab herself in the chest a couple a times. When we got here, she was out like a light. Don&#39;t know if she fainted or was in shock. But her vitals were good. We got her stabilized and then transferred her up to the hospital.&#39; We began to walk to the house. &#39;Was she</p><h2>What Happens When Women Pray</h2><p><i>What Happens When Women Pray </i>is a practical and biblical book about prayer.

Her iconic characters&#x2014;Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Olivia Pope, Annalise Keating&#x2014;live boldly and speak their minds. So who would suspect that Shonda Rhimes, the mega talent who owns Thursday night television (#TGIT), is an introvert? That she hired a publicist so she could <i>avoid</i> public appearances? That she hugged walls at splashy parties and suffered panic attacks before media interviews so severe she remembered nothing afterward?<br> <br>Before her Year of Yes, Shonda Rhimes was an expert at declining invitations others would leap to accept. With three children at home and three hit television shows on TV, it was easy to say that she was simply too busy. But in truth, she was also afraid. Afraid of cocktail party faux pas like chucking a chicken bone across a room; petrified of live television appearances where Shonda Rhimes could trip and fall and bleed out right there in front of a live studio audience; terrified of the difficult conversations that came so easily to her characters on-screen. In the <i>before</i>, Shonda&#x2019;s introvert life revolved around burying herself in work, snuggling her children, and comforting herself with food.<br> <br>And then, on Thanksgiving 2013, Shonda&#x2019;s sister muttered something that was both a wake up and a call to arms: <i>You never say yes to anything.</i><br> <br>The comment sat like a grenade, until it detonated. Then Shonda, the youngest of six children from a supremely competitive family, knew she had to embrace the challenge: for one year, she would say YES to everything that scared her.<br> <br>This poignant, intimate, and hilarious memoir explores Shonda&#x2019;s life <i>before</i> her Year of Yes&#x2014;from her nerdy, book-loving childhood creating imaginary friends to her devotion to creating television characters who reflected the world she saw around her (like Cristina Yang, whose ultimate goal wasn&#x2019;t marriage, and Cyrus Beene, who is a Republican <i>and </i>gay). And it chronicles her life <i>after </i>her Year of Yes had begun&#x2014;when Shonda forced herself out of the house and onto the stage, appearing on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live</i>, and giving the Dartmouth Commencement speech; when she learned to say yes to her health, yes to play and she stepped out of the shadows and into the sun; when she learned to explore, empower, applaud, and love her truest self. Yes.<br> <br>This wildly candid and compulsively readable book reveals how the mega talented Shonda Rhimes, an unexpected introvert, achieved badassery worthy of a Shondaland character. And how you can, too.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2015:</strong> I usually shy away from books with titles like <em>Year of Yes</em> &#x2013; hokey, I think, or glib. Besides, I don&#x2019;t need a self-help manual; I like to take my self-empowerment lying down, on the couch. Except... except that Rhimes, the creator/producer of such intelligent TV shows as <em>Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy</em> and <em>Scandal</em> is not only wiser, funnier, and cooler than your average therapist &#x2013; she&#x2019;s also been there, if &#x201c;there&#x201d; is the land of the angry, scared and emotionally dysfunctional. Never mind that she graduated from Dartmouth, is a proud and loving mother to her three kids, AND owns Thursday night TV, Rhimes was a mess until her sister made a chance remark at Thanksgiving &#x2013; &#x201c;You never say Yes to anything.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s when Rhimes decided not only to face her fears but to hug the life out of them. (OK, so some of her fears involve wearing a Carolina Herrera dress, gorgeous shoes and showing up at a star-studded benefit... but hey, fears is fears.) Rhimes found that saying Yes sometimes, paradoxically, also meant saying no, too &#x2013; as in, and this is my version, Yes, I want to be a thin person. No I don&#x2019;t want to eat a whole pecan pie in one sitting because I&#x2019;m more lonely than hungry. She also discovered that self-acceptance doesn&#x2019;t always go smoothly: as she pithily observes, sometimes the people who loved you when you were angry, dark and &#x201c;twisty&#x201d; don&#x2019;t like to hang around when you lighten up. So what, she says. At least you&#x2019;ve figured out how to live more or less happily ever after -- with yourself. <em> &#x2013; Sara Nelson</em></p>Shonda Rhimes is the critically acclaimed and award-winning creator and executive producer of the hit television series <i>Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy</i>, <i>Private Practice</i>, and <i>Scandal</i> and the executive producer of <i>How to Get Away With Murder</i>.

Johnston describes in shocking detail the loopholes our government provides the "super rich"--from private individuals to profitable corporations&#x2014;-to hide their wealth, to defer or evade tax payments, and to pass the bill to law-abiding middle-class Americans. The loss in revenue "imposes a severe cost on honest taxpayers" through reduced services, increased federal debt, and a weight on the middle class that threatens to impede its ability to achieve upward social mobility. <p></p>Admitting the extreme complexity of our economy and by extension our tax code, Johnston points out that the very wealthy do, of course, pay taxes. However, because of shelters that allow them to understate most of their income, they pay little more on average than most Americans on the dollar. This is regressive, and unquestionably favors the superrich. Johnston includes examples of outrageous corporate malfeasance (such as companies that establish off-shore tax addresses) and exposes the tax benefits of the particularly loathsome practice made famous by Jack Welch, in which thousands of wage earners are laid off while a handful of executives are granted hundreds of millions of dollars through deferred compensation, company stock options, and lucrative retirement packages, all at stock holders' xpense. In addition to these offenses, he describes the tax evasion methods of those who simply defy the law and are emboldened by a beleaguered IRS that is too underfunded to serve as an effective deterrent to tax cheats. Johnston calls for a complete overhaul of the system. But because those who most benefit from these laws comprise the "donor class" that supports the government power structure, our prospects for reform remain very bleak. --<i>Silvana Tropea</i>David Cay Johnston won a Pulitzer Prize and shared in another for his investigative reporting in <i>The New York Times</i>, for which he has written since 1995.

Award-winning actress. Perceptive songwriter and author. Mother. Wife of a rock god. Fashionista and trendsetter. Provocateur. In each and every one of these roles Courtney Love has demonstrated a wholehearted commitment to her art, and an intense drive and a lust for life that have made her a star and a celebrity icon&#x2014;but have also led her into some unwise, uncharted, and even dangerous territory. Simultaneously candid and enigmatic, Love has a mordant wit and vivid intelligence matched in intensity only by the extraordinary life she has led, from a bleak early childhood through great fame and terrible heartbreak to the present day. By turns exhilarating and unsettling, this is a story told for the first time in <i>Dirty Blonde</i>.<br>Composed of an astonishing and eclectic collection of deeply personal artifacts including personal letters, childhood records, poetry, diary entries, song lyrics, fanzines, show flyers, other original writings, and never-before-seen photographs, <i>Dirty Blonde</i> leads us through the unimaginable highs and the despairing lows of one of the most compelling and creative figures in the world of popular culture. Through these diaries we see Love&#x2019;s accomplishments, her mistakes, her history, and her bright future in a whole new light. From her upbringing in Oregon through her years living in Japan, New Zealand, and London, from her career highs with Hole and as a Hollywood leading lady to her personal heartbreak and struggle, <i>Dirty Blonde</i> is Love laid bare&#x2014;a wholly fascinating portrait of a fierce and insightful woman with an unblinking worldview and a determination to express herself no matter the cost.</p><p>"Male rock stars who've sung songs about rage pretty much grow on trees.

(The American Girls Collection, Book 4).</p><p></p><h2>The Oxford Bible Commentary</h2><p>Whether you see the Bible as the living word of God, or as a highly significant document from the ancient world, or as one of the classic works of world literature, <em>The Oxford Bible Commentary</em> will put in your hands everything you need to study and understand the biblical text. <br> Here is a monumental, line-by-line critical commentary on the Bible, covering all the books that appear in the NRSV. An essential reference work, this definitive book provides authoritative, non-denominational commentary written by an international team of more than 70 leading scholars from various religious backgrounds. Incorporating the latest research, the contributors examine the books of the Bible in exhaustive detail, taking a historical-critical approach that attempts to shed light on the scriptures by placing them in the context in which their first audiences would have encountered them, asking how they came to be composed and what were the purposes of their authors. The <em>Commentary</em> includes a general introduction, extensive introductions to both testaments and the Apocrypha, and briefer introductions to the particular books, plus an essay with commentary on important post-biblical Jewish and Christian literature. Each article concludes with a bibliography that points the reader toward the most important supplemental works in English, including major reference works, introductions, and so forth.<br> A truly stunning work of biblical scholarship, <em>The Oxford Bible Commentary</em> will be an invaluable resource for pastors preparing a sermon, for students, for those in study or discussion groups, and indeed for anyone--whether Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox Christian--who seeks a clearer perspective on a text that has been held in reverence for thousands of years. The <em>OBC</em> features a Logos Library System CD-ROM that, once unlocked, gives the reader access to its text and that of the New Revised Standard Version Bible. The CD is fully compatible with all Logos products.<br><br>* Detailed verse-by-verse commentary, written by over 70 of the world's leading biblical scholars from all the major Christian traditions and Judaism. <br>* Includes all the canonical books for the Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox traditions, and non-biblical Jewish and Christian writings from the biblical era. <br>* Combines the fruits of the historical-critical method with insights from other critical approaches to Bible study. <br>* Includes major introductions to every biblical book. <br>* Bibliographies of supplemental works in English are located throughout the book, making in-depth study of topics easier. <br>* 11 full color, Oxford Bible Maps. <br>* Two ribbon markers make it easy to keep one's place in the book.</p><p>The Bible stands in a category of its own among the world's literature. How you view the Bible, however, depends on what spectacles you are wearing. Like statistics, the Bible can be used to prove almost anything. As a result Bible commentaries are notorious for giving the author's particular angle on the Bible as if it is the only viewpoint. In the case of <i>The Oxford Bible Commentary</i> the angle is "objectively academic." John Muddiman and John Barton are the pair of Oxford dons who have put together the latest weighty book of Biblical scholarship. Happily, they are aware of the limitations of academic comment and don't pretend the book is more than it is. Contributing scholars are mostly British and American and most of them come from a mainstream Protestant background. The articles are therefore polished, precise, and professionally pedantic. No one can fault the meticulous scholarship and wealth of detailed content. That's just what you want from a hefty Bible commentary. On the other hand, what struck me from dipping into this tome is how slippery Biblical scholarship has become. At the turn of the last century Biblical criticism shot fundamentalism full of holes, but the new generation of scholars have now shot the certainties of old fashioned Biblical criticism full of holes. As a result the articles exhibit an odd mix of solid content with honest supposition, guesswork, and shoulder shrugging. This actually makes the book better. It's refreshing to read academics who admit their uncertainties. Their honesty allows some questions to remain open-ended, and that's exciting for any serious Biblical student. <i>--Dwight Longenecker, Amazon.co.uk</i><br><strong>John Barton</strong> is Oriel &amp; Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture at the University of Oxford. <strong>John Muddiman</strong> is G.

Cloistered together, they share the moldering house with the proud but impoverished remnants of an ancient family&#x2014;the sort that keeps their bloodline pure and their secrets close. Lady Allenby and her daughters, dependent upon Brisbane and devastated by their fall in society, seem adrift on the moor winds, powerless to change their fortunes. But poison does not discriminate between classes....<br><br>A mystery unfolds from the rotten heart of Grimsgrave, one Lady Julia may have to solve alone, as Brisbane appears inextricably tangled in its heinous twists and turns. But blood will out, and before spring touches the craggy northern landscape, Lady Julia will have uncovered a Gypsy witch, a dark rider and a long-buried legacy of malevolence and evil.<br><br></p><p>New York Times bestselling author Deanna Raybourn graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio with a double major in English and history and an emphasis on Shakespearean studies. She taught high school English for three years in San Antonio before leaving education to pursue a career as a novelist. Deanna makes her home in Virginia, where she lives with her husband and daughter and is hard at work on her next novel.Julia Grey, I would rather see you hanged than watch any sister of mine go haring off after a man who will not have her," my brother Bellmont raged. "And Portia, I am thoroughly appalled that you would not only condone such behaviour, but abet it by accompanying Julia. You are her elder sister. You ought to set an example." I sighed and stared longingly at the whisky decanter. Portia and I had known that the summons to our father's London townhouse was a thinly-veiled ambush, but I do not think either of us had expected the attack to be so quick, nor so brutal. We had scarcely taken our seats in Father's comfortable library before our eldest brother launched into a tirade against our proposed visit to Yorkshire. Father, ensconced behind his vast mahogany desk, said nothing. His expression was inscrutable behind his half-moon spectacles.<br><br>Catching my wistful glance, Portia rose and poured us both glasses of whisky. "Take this, dearest," she urged. "Bellmont is in rare form. He will surely rail at us until supper unless he has an apoplexy first," she finished cheerfully.<br><br>Bellmont's already high colour deepened alarmingly. "You may well jest about this, but it is unacceptable for Julia to accept an invitation to stay with Brisbane at his country house. He is an unmarried man, and she is a widow of thirty. Even if you are there to chaperone, Portia, you must admit, it would be a complete violation of propriety."<br><br>"Oh, Julia hasn't been invited," Portia responded helpfully. "I was. Julia rather invited herself."<br><br>Bellmont clicked his teeth together and drew in a deep breath, his nostrils going white at the edges. "If that is supposed to offer me comfort, it is a cold one, I assure you."<br><br>Portia shrugged and sipped at her whisky. Bellmont turned to me, deliberately softening his tone. At more than forty years of age and heir to our father's earldom, he had long since grown accustomed to having his own way. It was only with his eccentric family that his success was mixed. With a cunning blend of sternness, cajolery, and logic, he was sometimes able to bend us to his will, but just as often he found himself not speaking to more than one of his nine siblings. Now he attempted an appeal to my reason.<br><br>"Julia, I understand you were quite bereft when Edward died. You were very young to be a widow, and I am sympathetic to the fact that you felt compelled to search out your husband's murderer." I raised my brows. He had not been so sympathetic at the time. When I had unmasked my husband's killer in a dramatic scene during which my town-house was burned down and I nearly lost my life, Bellmont had actually stopped speaking to me for two months. Apparently, murder is a failing of the middle classes only. Aristocrats are supposed to be above such unpleasantness.<br><br>He went on. "I realise your connection with Mr. Brisbane was a necessary evil at the time. He has proved himself a thoroughly capable inquiry agent and, mercifully, a discreet one. But your association with this man cannot continue. I do not know what Father was thinking to invite him to Bellmont Abbey at Christmas, but it was badly done, and it has given you ideas."<br><br>"And God knows women mustn't have <i>ideas,</i>" Portia murmured into her glass. Bellmont did not even bother to look at her. We were well-accustomed to Portia's pointed asides.<br><br>I looked helplessly at Father, who merely shrugged and poured himself a glass of whisky. If Bellmont continued on we should become a family of inebriates.<br><br>"Monty," I began, deliberately sweetening my tone, "I do appreciate your concern. But Father has already explained to you Brisbane was there to pursue an investigation. He left before the family arrived for Christmas. You did not even see him. I have never invited him to accompany me to your home, nor have I ever foisted him upon you in any social situation, although he would not be entirely out of place. His great-uncle <i>is </i>the Duke of Aberdour, you know."<br><br>Bellmont rubbed a hand over his face, smoothing the furrows that marked his handsome brow. "My dear, his antecedents are quite immaterial. He is in trade. He is a half-Gypsy vagabond who makes his living by dealing in the sordid miseries of others. His exploits are fodder for the newspapers, and we have been dragged through those rather enough at present," he finished, shooting Father a look that was ripe with bitterness.<br><br>Father waved an indolent hand. "Do not blame me, boy. I did my best to sweep the entire matter under the carpet, as did Brisbane." That much was true. The newspapers, through Father's influence and Brisbane's connections, had taken little enough notice of the events at Bellmont Abbey, although a few rather distasteful morsels had found their way into print.<br><br>Bellmont swung round to face Father while Portia and I huddled closer to one another on the sofa and drank our whisky.<br><br>"I am not unaware of your efforts, Father. But the press have always been interested in our little peccadilloes, and you have simply not done enough to keep them at bay, particularly when you were so indiscreet as to entertain your mistress at the same Christmas party as your children and grandchildren."<br><br>"A hit, a palpable hit," Portia whispered. I stifled a giggle. Bellmont was being rather unfair to Father. He had exercised as much authority over the press in the matter as he could. Considering what had actually transpired at the Abbey, we were lucky it had not become the scandal of the century.<br><br>"Madame de Bellefleur is not my mistress," Father said, puffing his cheeks indignantly. "She is my friend, and I shall thank you to speak of her respectfully."<br><br>"It does not matter what she <i>is,"</i> Bellmont pointed out acidly. "It only matters what they <i>say </i> she is. Do you have any notion how damaging such stories could be to me, to my children? Orlando is considering a run for Parliament when he is established, and Virgilia is to be presented this season. Her chances for a good match could be completely overthrown by your conduct, and it will not improve matters for her aunts to be seen chasing off to Yorkshire to stay with a bachelor of questionable reputation."<br><br>Portia stirred. "I should think the fact that I live openly with a woman would be far more damaging to her chances for a society marriage," she remarked coolly.<br><br>Bellmont flinched. "Your relationship with Jane is something to which I have become reconciled over these past ten years. It is a credit to Jane that she lives quietly and does not care to move in society."<br><br>Portia's eyes glinted ominously, and I laid a warning hand on her wrist. "Jane is the love of my life, Bellmont, not a pet to be trained."<br><br>Father held up a hand. "Enough. I will not have you quarrelling like dogs over an old bone. I thought we buried that particular issue long ago. Bellmont, you forget yourself. I have permitted you to abuse your sisters and me quite long enough."<br><br>Bellmont opened his mouth to protest, but Father waved him off. "You have a care for your sisters' reputations, and that does you credit, but I must observe for a man so often hailed as one of the greatest brains of his generation, you are remarkably obtuse about women. You've been married going on twenty years, boy. Have you not yet learned that it is easier to pull a star down from the heavens than to bend a woman to your will? The most tractable of women will kick over the traces if you insist upon obedience and, in case it has escaped your notice, your sisters are not the most tractable of women. No, if they are intent upon going to Yorkshire, go they will."<br><br>Portia flicked a triumphant gaze at Bellmont who had gone quite pale under the angry wash of red over his fair complexion. I took another sip of my whisky and wondered not for the first time why my parents had found it necessary to have so many children.<br><br>"Father," Bellmont began, but Father rose, straightening his poppy-coloured waistcoat and raising a hand.<br><br>"I know. You are worried for your children, as you should be, and I will see that their chances are not damaged by the actions of their aunts." He paused, for dramatic effect no doubt, then pronounced in ringing tones, "Your sisters will travel under the protection of their brother, Valerius."<br><br>Portia and I gaped at him, stunned to silence. Bellmont was quicker off the mark. Mollified, he nodded at Father. "Very well. Valerius is thoroughly incapable of controlling them, but at least his presence will lend the appearance of respectability. Thank you, Father." He turned to leave, giving us a piercing look. "I suppose it would be too much to ask that you conduct yourselves like ladies, but do try," he offered as a parting shot.<br><br>Portia was still sputtering when the footman shut the door behind him. "Honestly, Father, I do not see why you didn't have him drowned as a child. You've four other sons, what's one at the bottom of the pond?"<br><br>Father shrugged. "I would have drowned him myself had I known he would turn out Tory. I know you want to remonstrate with me over the suggestion of travelling with Valerius, but I want to talk to your sister. Leave us to chat a moment, will you, my dear?" he said to Portia.<br><br>She rose gracefully and turned, pulling a face at me as she went. I tried not to fidget, but I felt suddenly shy and uncertain. I smiled up at Father winsomely and attempted to divert the conversation.<br><br>"Valerius will be simply furious with you, Father. You know he hates to leave London, and he is devoted to his work with Dr. Bent. He's just bought a new microscope."<br><br>It might have been a good diversion under other circumstances. Father could rant easily for an hour on the subject of Valerius and his unsuitable interest in medicine. But he had other game afoot.<br><br>He turned to me, folding his arms across his chest. "Do not look to distract me," he said sternly. "What the devil do you mean by hunting Brisbane like a fox? Monty is right, though I would not give him the satisfaction of saying so in front of him. It is damned unseemly and shows a distinct lack of pride. I reared you for better."<br><br>I smoothed my skirts under nervous fingers. "I am not hunting Brisbane. He asked Portia to come and help him sort out the estate. Apparently the former owner left it in a frightful state and Brisbane hasn't any lady to act as chatelaine and put things in order." I opened my eyes very wide to show I was telling the truth.<br><br>"Nicholas Brisbane is entirely capable of ordering his own bedsheets and hiring his own cook," he commented, narrowing his gaze.<br><br>"There is nothing sinister afoot," I assured him. "Brisbane wrote in January to accept Portia's offer to help arrange his household. He told her to wait until April when the weather would be more hospitable. That is the whole of it."<br><br>"And how did you become involved?" Father demanded.<br><br>"I saw the letter and thought springtime on the moors sounded very pleasant."<br><br>Father shook his head slowly. "Not likely. You mean to settle this thing between you, whatever it is."<br><br>I twisted a bit of silken cushion fringe in my fingers and looked away. "It is complicated," I began.<br><br>"Then let us have it simply," he cut in brutally. "Has he offered you marriage?"<br><br>"No." My voice was nearly inaudible, even to my own ears.<br><br>"Has he given you a betrothal ring?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Has he ever spoken of marrying you?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Has he written to you since he left for Yorkshire?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>My replies dropped like stones, heavy with importance. He waited a long moment and the only sounds were the soft rustling of the fire on the hearth and the quiet ticking of the mantel clock.<br><br>"He has offered you nothing, made no plans for the future, has not even written. And still you mean to go to him?" His voice was soft now, free of judgment or recrimination, and yet it stung like salt on a wound.<br><br>I raised my gaze to his. "I must. I will know when I see him again. If there is nothing there, I will return to London by the first train and never speak of him again, never wonder what might have been. But if there is a chance that he feels for me&#x2014;" I broke off. The rest of it need not be spoken aloud.<br><br>"And you are quite determined?"<br><br>"Quite," I said, biting off the word sharply. He said nothing for a moment, but searched my face, doubtless looking for any sign that I was less than resolute and might be persuaded to abandon my plans.<br><br>At length he sighed, then drained the last of his whisky. "Go then. Go under Valerius' protection, however feeble that may be, and find out if Brisbane loves you. But I tell you this," he said, folding me into his embrace and pressing a kiss into my hair, "I may be above seventy years of age, but I still fence every day and if the blackguard hurts you I will hunt him down and leave a stiletto in his heart."<br><br>"Thank you, Father. That is very comforting."<br><br>Dinner that evening was a peculiarly quiet affair. Portia was a charming hostess and kept an admirable table. She was renowned for the quality of her food and wines as well as the excellence of the company. She knew the most interesting people and often invited them to little suppers arranged to show them to perfection, like gems in a thoughtful setting. But that night there were only ourselves&#x2014;Portia, her belovedJane, and me. We were all of us occupied with our own thoughts and said little, our silences punctuated with phlegmy snorts from Portia's vile pet, Mr. Pugglesworth, asleep under the table.<br><br>After one particularly nasty interlude, I laid down my knife. "Portia, must you have that dog in the dining room? He is putting me quite off my food."<br><br>She waved a fork at me. "Do not be peevish just because Bellmont took you to task today."<br><br>"Puggy is rather foul," Jane put in quietly. "I will remove him to the pantry."<br><br>She rose and collected the animal, coaxing him out with a bit of stewed prune. Portia watched her, saying nothing. They were a study in contrasts, each lovely in her own way, but different as chalk and cheese. Portia had a fine-boned elegance, coupled with the classic March family colouring of dark hair faintly touched with red and wide green eyes. She dressed flamboyantly, in colours suited to the pale alabaster of her skin, always in a single hue from head to toe.</p><h2>Knitting Ganseys</h2><p><p>Ganseys are sweaters that developed in 19th-century England as hard-wearing garments for hard-working fishermen.

Doerr lives in Boise, Idaho, with his wife and two sons.Italy looms. We make checklists -- diapers, crib bedding, a book light. Baby formula. Two dozen Nutri-Grain bars. We have never eaten Nutri-Grain bars in our lives, but now, suddenly, it seems important to have some.<p>I stare at our new Italian-to-English pocket dictionary and worry. Is "Here is my passport" in there? Is "Where for God's sake can I buy some baby wipes?"</p><p>We pretend to be calm. Neither of us is willing to consider that tomorrow we'll pile onto an Airbus with six-month-old twins and climb to thirty-seven thousand feet and stay there for fourteen hours. Instead we zip and unzip our duffels, take the wheels off the stroller, and study small, grainy photos of St. Peter's on ricksteves.com.</p><p></p><p>Rain in Boise; wind in Denver. The airplane hurtles through the troposphere at six hundred miles per hour. Owen sleeps in a mound of blankets between our feet. Henry sleeps in my arms. All the way across the Atlantic, there is turbulence; bulkheads shake, glasses tinkle, galley latches open and close.</p><p>We are moving from Boise, Idaho, to Rome, Italy, a place I've never been. When I think of Italy, I imagine decadence, dark brown oil paintings, emperors in sandals. I see a cross-section of a school-project Colosseum, fashioned from glue and sugar cubes; I see a navy-blue-and-white soap dish, bought in Florence, chipped on one corner, that my mother kept beside her bathroom sink for thirty years.</p><p>More clearly than anything else, I see a coloring book I once got for Christmas entitled <i>Ancient Rome.</i> Two babies slurped milk from the udders of a wolf. A Caesar grinned in his leafy crown. A slinky, big-pupiled maiden posed with a jug beside a fountain. Whatever Rome was to me then -- seven years old, Christmas night, snowflakes dashing against the windows, a lighted spruce blinking on and off downstairs, crayons strewn across the carpet -- it's hardly clearer now: outlines of elephants and gladiators, cartoonish palaces in the backgrounds, a sense that I had chosen all the wrong colors, aquamarine for chariots, goldenrod for skies.</p><p>On the television screen planted in the seat-back in front of me, our little airplane icon streaks past Marseilles, Nice. A bottle of baby formula, lying sideways in the seat pocket, soaks through the fabric and drips onto my carry-on, but I don't reach down to straighten it for fear I will wake Henry. We have crossed from North America to Europe in the time it takes to show a Lindsay Lohan movie and two episodes of <i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i> The outside temperature is minus sixty degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p></p><p>A taxi drops us in front of a palace: stucco and travertine, a five-bay fa�ade, a staircase framed by topiaries. The gatekeeper stubs his cigarette on a shoe sole and says, in English, "You're the ones with the twins?" He shakes our hands, gives us a set of keys.</p><p>Our apartment is in a building next to the palace. The front gate is nine feet tall and iron and scratched in a thousand places; it looks as if wild dogs have been trying to break into the courtyard. A key unlocks it; we find the entrance around the side. The boys stare up from their car seats with huge eyes. We load them into a cage elevator with wooden doors that swing inward. Two floors rattle past. I hear finches, truck brakes. Neighbors clomp through the stairwell; a door slams. There are the voices of children. The gate, three stories down, clangs hugely.</p><p>Our door opens into a narrow hallway. I fill it slowly with bags. Shauna, my wife, carries the babies inside. The apartment is larger than we could have hoped: two bedrooms, two bathrooms, new cabinets, twelve-foot ceilings, tile floors that carry noise. There's an old desk, a navy blue couch. The refrigerator is hidden inside a cupboard. There's a single piece of art: a poster of seven or eight gondolas crossing a harbor, a hazy piazza in the background.</p><p>The apartment's jewel is a terrace, which we reach through a narrow door in the corner of the kitchen, as if the architect recognized the need for a doorway only at the last moment. It squats over the building's entrance, thirty feet across, fifty feet up. From it we can look between treetops at jigsaw pieces of Rome: terra-cotta roofs, three or four domes, a double-decker campanile, the scattered green of terrace gardens, everything hazed and strange and impossible.</p><p>The air is moist and warm. If anything, it smells vaguely of cabbage.</p><p>"This is ours?" Shauna asks. "The whole terrace?" It is. Except for our door, there is no other entrance onto it.</p><p>We lower the babies into mismatched cribs that don't look especially safe. A mosquito floats through the kitchen. We share a Nutri-Grain bar. We eat five packages of saltines. We have moved to Italy.</p><p></p><p>Copyright � 2007 by Anthony Doerr</p></p><h2>Intermediate Counting and Probability</h2><p>This book contains the solution in the text Intermediate Counting &amp; Probability.</p><p></p><h2>The Changeling: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;If the literary gods mixed together Haruki Murakami and Ralph Ellison, the result would be Victor LaValle.&#x201d;&#x2014;Anthony Doerr, author of <i>All the Light We Cannot See</i></b><br><br><b>&#x201c;A dark fairy tale of New York, full of magic and loss, myth and mystery, love and madness. <i>The Changeling</i> is a mesmerizing, monumental work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Marlon James, author of <i>A Brief History of Seven Killings</i></b><br><br><b>One of <i>Time</i>&#x2019;s Top 10 Novels of the Year � One of <i>USA Today</i>&#x2019;s top 10 books of the year&nbsp;� A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book<br></b><br> When Apollo Kagwa&#x2019;s father disappeared, all he left his son were strange recurring dreams and a box of books stamped with the word IMPROBABILIA.

He lives in New York City with his wife and kids and teaches at Columbia University.This fairy tale begins in 1968 during a garbage strike. In February New York City&#x2019;s sanitation workers refused to pick up trash for eight straight days. One hundred thousand tons of garbage filled the sidewalks, spilled into the streets. Rats ran laps alongside morning joggers. Rubbish fires boiled the air. The five boroughs had been given up for dead. Still, there was some cracked magic in the air because that was when Lillian and Brian met. Each had journeyed from far--flung lands to find one another in Queens. Neither could&#x2019;ve guessed the wildness that falling in love would unleash.<br><br> Lillian Kagwa emigrated from Uganda while Brian West arrived from the only slightly less foreign territory of Syracuse. This daughter of East Africa and son of upstate New York met at a cut--rate modeling agency on Northern Boulevard. Neither was a client.<br><br>The week of the garbage strike Lillian got hired as a secretary at the agency, greeting guests at the front desk. A pleasant sight for folks strolling sidewalks saddled with week--old waste. Brian, a parole officer, had been paying occasional visits to the agency&#x2019;s founder, Pavel Aresenyev, one of his parolees, who&#x2019;d spent four years in prison for fraud. Brian didn&#x2019;t believe Pavel had gone legit. But that week Brian became focused less on Mr. Aresenyev and more on the new secretary who greeted him when he arrived. Meeting her felt like finding a rose growing in a landfill. Brian dropped by the modeling agency four times that week.<br><br>Despite his immediate attraction, Brian had a habit of mispronouncing Lillian Kagwa&#x2019;s last name, and Lillian kept mistaking Brian for other white men. Hardly kismet. Still Brian West&#x2014;-short, stocky, and persistent&#x2014;-simply wouldn&#x2019;t quit. And on the days when he didn&#x2019;t show up, Lillian, to her own surprise, found she missed him.<br> Lillian Kagwa had come from Jinja, the second--largest city in Uganda, where she&#x2019;d lived through the country&#x2019;s emancipation from Britain and its eventual homegrown rule by Milton Obote. Obote used the army and his secret police, the General Service Unit, to rule the land. They spread wickedness wherever they went.<br><br> In 1967 Lillian and three cousins were traveling to the capital, Kampala, when they were pulled over by three men claiming to be agents of the GSU. The four cousins sat quietly as the agents inspected their identification, then demanded the only male cousin&#x2014;-Arthur&#x2014;-come out and open the trunk. Arthur didn&#x2019;t want to leave Lillian and his sisters and hesitated. In that moment, one agent leaned in and casually shot Arthur in the stomach.<br><br> Lillian and her cousins were temporarily deafened by the sound, blinded by the muzzle flash, but Lillian still sensed the agent who&#x2019;d fired the gun pawing inside the car to pull out the keys. Lillian, at the wheel, shifted the car into drive and shot off before her senses had returned to her, weaving across the two--lane road like a drunk. The agents fired at the car but couldn&#x2019;t pursue it; their own vehicle had run out of gas. They&#x2019;d set up the checkpoint to steal a suitable vehicle and would have to wait for another.<br><br> Lillian reached Kampala in half an hour, speeding the whole way. Arthur died long before that. An incident like this hardly counted as newsworthy. Uganda, as a whole, was going buckwild, and Lillian Kagwa wanted out. One year later Lillian secured a visa to the United States.<br> In 1968 Lillian came to New York. She was twenty--five and knew no one, but because of Uganda&#x2019;s British rule, she already spoke the king&#x2019;s English, and this made her transition easier. One of the reason&#x2019;s Mr. Aresenyev hired her at the modeling agency was because her command of English was so much better than his. She made the business sound serious, legitimate, though Brian West&#x2019;s suspicions were right: the whole thing was a scam. Lillian didn&#x2019;t know this when she accepted the work. All she knew was the job paid twice the state minimum wage, three bucks an hour. Back in Uganda, she hadn&#x2019;t been able to find work of any kind, so she cherished the gig. And what was a garbage strike compared with state--sanctioned murder?<br><br> The agency, Glamour Time, was run out of a windowless second--floor office near Queensboro Plaza, remote from any hub of high fashion but centrally located for soaking the aspiring models of working--class Queens. Potential clients could join the agency as long as they had headshots. Luckily, Mr. Aresenyev had a small studio right there at the agency and could snap the shots himself for a fee. For certain young women, he offered to take the shots after hours, just the two of them. The streets of New York were overrun with uncollected garbage, but Glamour Time carried its own stink. The only honest aspect of the business was the East African woman answering phones out front.<br><br> Mr. Aresenyev&#x2019;s business might&#x2019;ve run just fine for quite a while, soaking hopeful young women for years, except his damn parole officer had made the front office into his second home. How were you going to run a decent fraud when a cop was stopping by every other morning? Brian West was bad for business. And since he was smitten with Lillian that meant Lillian Kagwa was bad for business. So Mr. Aresenyev fired her. Not the smartest plan, but Mr. Aresenyev wasn&#x2019;t bright. Now Brian pursued Pavel relentlessly, an Inspector Javert from Onondaga County. Charging for the headshots wasn&#x2019;t illegal, but running a photo studio without a permit was enough to count as a violation of parole. Pavel Aresenyev went back to jail. Brian West got a commendation. Lillian Kagwa needed a new job.<br><br> She worked as an administrative secretary at a law firm in midtown Manhattan. The new job paid less. She moved into a smaller apartment. She cut off all communications with Brian. He&#x2019;d cost her a good job, and the commute to midtown added a half hour of travel time each way, so no, she did not want to get dinner and a movie with Brian, thank you. Anyway, she was young, and it was New York City, where a lot more fun was to be had than back in Jinja. They met in 1968 but didn&#x2019;t go on their first real date until eight years later.<br> Brian West gave Lillian room, backed off by a borough; he rented a place on Staten Island, but he couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking of her. Why? What was it about Lillian? He couldn&#x2019;t quite explain. It was as if she&#x2019;d cast a spell.<br>Brian West had been the only child of two wildly unromantic drunks. At twelve Brian had a job selling candy at the Elmwood Theatre. He made the mistake of proudly displaying his earnings to his father, Frank. He expected a pat on the shoulder, words of congratulations; instead the boy endured a strong--arm robbery right in his own living room. His dad bought a case of Genesee beer with the money. Mom and Dad finished it before bedtime. A household like that will either break you or toughen you up. Maybe both. What was waiting on a woman to forgive you compared with having your father beat you up and steal your first paycheck? <br><br> Late in 1976 it finally happened. Brian West and Lillian Kagwa went on a date. They&#x2019;d both been twenty--five when they first met during the week of the garbage strike, but now they were thirty--three. Lillian had met a lot of men during those intervening years, and Brian benefited from the comparison. He worked hard, didn&#x2019;t drink, saved his money, and paid his debts. Funny how much she valued such qualities now. The only hiccup came at dinner, when Brian talked about how much he wanted children, the chance to be a husband and a father. As soon as he&#x2019;d seen her at Glamour Time he&#x2019;d sensed she would be a wonderful mother. When he finished talking she reminded him, gently, that this was their first date. Maybe they could wait to make wedding plans until after the movie at least? To Brian&#x2019;s credit, he didn&#x2019;t act wounded or angry&#x2014;-he laughed. He didn&#x2019;t know it, but it was at this moment that Lillian truly fell for him.<br><br>He took her to see Rocky. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been Lillian&#x2019;s choice, but halfway through the movie, she started to enjoy herself. She even saw herself on the screen. A fierce dreamer. That&#x2019;s what this movie was about. And wasn&#x2019;t that her? She liked to think so. Maybe that was why Brian brought her to see this picture. To show her something about himself that he could never put into words. He&#x2019;d told her the story of being robbed by his father, and she&#x2019;d told him about Arthur getting gutshot in the car, and now here they both were in a darkened Times Square theater. Together. A pair of survivors. It seemed so unlikely&#x2014;-all the life that had led them here&#x2014;-as improbable as myth. In the dark she held his hand. Though they wouldn&#x2019;t have sex for another three hours, it would be accurate to say their first child&#x2014;-their only child&#x2014;-was conceived right then. A thought, an idea, a shared dream; parenthood is a story two people start telling together.<br><br>By April 1977 Lillian was showing. Brian found them a two--bedroom apartment in Jackson Heights. Their son came in September. Brian thought it would be weird to name a half--black kid Rocky, so instead they named him Apollo. Brian liked to carry the newborn in the crook of one arm, cooing to him, &#x201c;You are the god, Apollo. Good night, my little sun.&#x201d; And they lived happily ever after. At least for a few years.<br><br>By Apollo&#x2019;s fourth birthday Brian West was gone.<br><br>Brian hadn&#x2019;t run off with another woman or skipped town to move back to Syracuse. The man might as well have been erased from existence. He couldn&#x2019;t be found because he&#x2019;d left no trail, neither breadcrumbs nor credit card receipts. Gone. Disappeared. Vanished.<br> When Apollo was born, Brian and Lillian thought they&#x2019;d reached the end of the story, but they&#x2019;d been wrong. The wildness had only begun.</p><h2>Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden</h2><p>Though apocryphal in nature, these books--suppressed by the Church Fathers--are fascinating and beautifully written.

In 1953, in the presence of an investigator, Aldous Huxley took four-tenths of a gramme of mescalin, sat down and waited to see what would happen. When he opened his eyes everything, from the flowers in a vase to the creases in his trousers, was transformed. His account of his experience, and his vision for all that psychedelics could offer to mankind, has influenced writers, artists and thinkers around the world. <p>The unabridged text of <i>The Doors of Perception </i>by Aldous Huxley</p> <p> <b>VINTAGE MINIS: GREAT MINDS.

He began writing poetry and short stories in his early 20s, but it was his first novel, <i>Crome Yellow</i> (1921), which established his literary reputation. This was swiftly followed by <i>Antic Hay</i> (1923),&nbsp;<i>Those Barren Leaves</i> (1925) and <i>Point Counter Point</i> (1928) &#x2013; bright, brilliant satires in which Huxley wittily but ruthlessly passed judgement on the shortcomings of contemporary society. For most of the 1920s Huxley lived in Italy and an account of his experiences there can be found in <i>Along the Road</i> (1925). The great novels of ideas, including his most famous work <i>Brave New World</i> (published in 1932 this warned against the dehumanising aspects of scientific and material 'progress') and the pacifist novel <i>Eyeless in Gaza</i> (1936) were accompanied by a series of wise and brilliant essays, collected in volume form under titles such as <i>Music at Night</i> (1931) and <i>Ends and Means&nbsp;</i>(1937). In 1937, at the height of his fame, Huxley left Europe to live in C alifornia, working for a time as a screenwriter in Hollywood. As the West braced itself for war, Huxley came increasingly to believe that the key to solving the world's problems lay in changing the individual through mystical enlightenment. The exploration of the inner life through mysticism and hallucinogenic drugs was to dominate his work for the rest of his life. Hisbeliefs found expression in both fiction (Time Must Have a Stop,1944, and Island, 1962)and non-fiction (The Perennial Philosophy, 1945; Grey Eminence, 1941; and the accountof his first mescalin experience, The Doors of Perception, 1954.

He could handle a saber, a pistol, a rudder, or a golf club; he handled women by necessity and men for pleasure. He spoke the Italian of his archduchess mother, the German of his archduke father, the English of his British royal friends, the Polish of the country his father wished to rule, and the Ukrainian of the land Wilhelm wished to rule himself. In this exhilarating narrative history, prize-winning historian Timothy D. Snyder offers an indelible portrait of an aristocrat whose life personifies the wrenching upheavals of the first half of the twentieth century, as the rule of empire gave way to the new politics of nationalism. Coming of age during the First World War, Wilhelm repudiated his family to fight alongside Ukrainian peasants in hopes that he would become their king. When this dream collapsed he became, by turns, an ally of German imperialists, a notorious French lover, an angry Austrian monarchist, a calm opponent of Hitler, and a British spy against Stalin. Played out in Europe's glittering capitals and bloody battlefields, in extravagant ski resorts and dank prison cells, <i>The Red Prince</i> captures an extraordinary moment in the history of Europe, in which the old order of the past was giving way to an undefined future-and in which everything, including identity itself, seemed up for grabs.</p><p><b>Timothy D. Snyder</b> is Professor of History at Yale University. He received his doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1997, and has held fellowships in Paris, Vienna, Warsaw, and at Harvard. He won the George Louis Beer Prize of the American Historical Association in 2003 for his book <i>The Reconstruction of Nations</i>, and his most recent book, <i>Sketches From a Secret War</i>, was awarded the <i>Pro Historia Polonorum</i> by the First Congress of Foreign Researchers of Poland for the best book on Polish history by a foreign author published in the preceding five years. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut."<i>The Red Prince</i> must be devoured by anyone who has any interest in the history of Central and Eastern Europe. But the radius of this book ought to reach beyond that. This is a radiant combination of stunning research, worldly knowledge, and good writing. A very rare achievement." -- <i>John Lukacs, author of <i>Five Days in London</i></i><br><br>"Here is a master historian at work--patient, determined, scrupulous and smart. And how many times a year am I told a story that I've never even heard of? Not often. So, caution, highly addictive!" -- <i>Alan Furst, author of <i>The Polish Officer</i> and <i>The Foreign Correspondent</i></i><br><br>"Timothy Snyder has already shown that he has a masterly intellectual grasp of complex issues such as the identity problems of Central and Eastern Europe. He now demonstrates that he can tell a good tale: lucidly, briskly and seductively. <i>The Red Prince</i> delves into areas of history with which most western readers will be unfamiliar. In consequence, it educates as it informs as it entertains." -- <i>Norman Davies, author of <i>No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe 1939-1945</i></i><br><br>"Timothy Snyder is not only one of the leading authorities on Central European history writing today, he is also an elegant stylist, with a talent for storytelling--a wonderful combination." -- <i>Anne Applebaum, author of the Pulitzer prize-winning <i>Gulag</i></i><br><br>"Timothy Snyder is one of the most remarkable and original historians of Eastern Europe of his generation.

This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams. <p>Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.</p> <p>Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.</p></p><p>Once again using an astutely written fictional tale to unambiguously but painlessly deliver some hard truths about critical business procedures, Patrick Lencioni targets group behavior in the final entry of his trilogy of corporate fables. And like those preceding it, <i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</i> is an entertaining, quick read filled with useful information that will prove easy to digest and implement. This time, Lencioni weaves his lessons around the story of a troubled Silicon Valley firm and its unexpected choice for a new CEO: an old-school manager who had retired from a traditional manufacturing company two years earlier at age 55. Showing exactly how existing personnel failed to function as a unit, and precisely how the new boss worked to reestablish that essential conduct, the book's first part colorfully illustrates the ways that teamwork can elude even the most dedicated individuals--and be restored by an insightful leader. A second part offers details on Lencioni's "five dysfunctions" (absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results), along with a questionnaire for readers to use in evaluating their own teams and specifics to help them understand and overcome these common shortcomings. Like the author's previous books, <i>The Five Temptations of a CEO</i> and <i>Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive</i>, this is highly recommended. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>"As compelling, readable and practical as his other books. I'm sure this will be another business classic." (Richard Carr, President &amp; CEO, TEC International) <p> "Every manager and executive will recognize themselves somewhere in this book. Lencioni distills the problems that keep even the most talented teams from realizing their full potential. Even more important, he shows -- in prose that is crisp, clear, and fun to read -- how to solve them." (Geoffrey A. Moore, Chairman, The Chasm Group, Author, <i>Crossing the Chasm; Inside the Tornado; Living on the Fault Line</i>) </p><p> "I read most best-selling business books. What sets Lencioni apart is his ability to provide insightful and practical solutions to complex management challenges." (Phillip Hildebrand, Executive VP and Chief Distribution Officer, New York Life Insurance Company) </p><p> "A gripping analysis of what makes teams work effectively. This fine work is a must read for any leader that has come to grips with the fact that no one makes progress &#x2014; much less succeeds - alone." (James Amos, president and CEO, Mail Boxes, Etc.) </p><p> "Compelling and incisive, this will become the definitive guide on how to build and manage successful teams." (Jean Kovacs, president and CEO, Comergent Technologies)</p></p><h2>Horse, Follow Closely: Native American Horsemanship</h2><p>Illustrates the traditional horse training methods of the Native Americans, which stresses the oneness of horse and rider, and a relationship of trust, harmony, and respect</p><p>GaWaNi Pony Boy is an accomplished horseman and trainer.

Now an internationally successful motivational speaker, Nick eagerly spreads his message: the most important goal is to find your life&#x2019;s purpose and to never give up, despite whatever difficulties or seemingly impossible odds stand in your way.<br><br>Nick tells the story of his physical disabilities and the emotional battle he endured while learning to deal with them as a child, teen, and young adult. &#x201c;For the longest, loneliest time, I wondered if there was anyone on earth&nbsp;<i>like me</i>, and whether there was any purpose to my life other than pain and humiliation.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Nick shares how his faith in God has been his major source of strength, and he<b>&nbsp;</b>explains that once he found a sense of purpose&#x2014;inspiring others to better their lives and the world around them--he found the confidence to build a rewarding and productive life without limits. Let Nick inspire you to start living your own life without limits.<br><br>Nick offers practical advice for realizing a life of fulfillment and happiness by building trust in others, developing supportive relationships, and gaining strength for the journey.

It was in recent years that Nick made the move from Australia to Southern California, where he now continues to passionately travel around the world, spreading a message of hope to all people.<br>www.nickvujicic.comOne<br><br>If You Can&#x2019;t Get a Miracle, Become One<br><br>O ne of my most popular videos on YouTube shows footage of me skateboarding, surfing, playing music, hitting a golf ball, falling down, getting up, speaking to audiences, and best of all, receiving hugs from all sorts of great people.<br><br>All in all, those are pretty ordinary activities that just about anybody can do, right? So why do you think that video has been viewed millions of times? My theory is that people are drawn to watch it because despite my physical limitations, I&#x2019;m living as though I have no limits.<br><br>People often expect someone with a severe disability to be inactive, maybe even angry and withdrawn. I like to surprise them by showing that I lead a very adventurous and fulfilling existence.<br><br>Among the hundreds of comments on that video, here&#x2019;s one typical remark: &#x201c;Seeing a guy like this being happy makes me wonder why the hell I feel sorry for myself sometimes . . . or feel that I&#x2019;m not attractive enough, or funny enough, or WHATEVER. How can I even think thoughts like that when this guy is living without limbs and still being HAPPY!?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m often asked that very question: &#x201c;Nick, how can you be so happy?&#x201d; You may be dealing with your own challenges, so I&#x2019;ll give you the quick answer up front:<br><br>I found happiness when I realized that as imperfect as I may be, I am the perfect Nick Vujicic. I am God&#x2019;s creation, designed according to His plan for me. That&#x2019;s not to say that there isn&#x2019;t room for improvement. I&#x2019;m always trying to be better so I can better serve Him and the world!<br><br>I do believe my life has no limits. I want you to feel the same way about your life, no matter what your challenges may be. As we begin our journey together, please take a moment to think about any limitations you&#x2019;ve placed on your life or that you&#x2019;ve allowed others to place on it. Now think about what it would be like to be free of those limitations. What would your life be if anything were possible?<br><br>I&#x2019;m officially disabled, but I&#x2019;m truly enabled because of my lack of limbs. My unique challenges have opened up unique opportunities to reach so many in need. Just imagine what is possible for you!<br><br>Too often we tell ourselves we aren&#x2019;t smart enough or attractive enough or talented enough to pursue our dreams. We buy into what others say about us, or we put restrictions on ourselves. What&#x2019;s worse is that when you consider yourself unworthy, you are putting limits on how God can work through you!<br><br>When you give up on your dreams, you put God in a box. After all, you are His creation. He made you for a purpose. Therefore your life cannot be limited any more than God&#x2019;s love can be contained.<br><br>I have a choice. You have a choice. We can choose to dwell on disappointments and shortcomings. We can choose to be bitter, angry, or sad. Or when faced with hard times and hurtful people, we can choose to learn from the experience and move forward, taking responsibility for our own happiness.<br><br>As God&#x2019;s child, you are beautiful and precious, worth more than all the diamonds in the world. You and I are perfectly suited to be who we were meant to be! Even still, it should always be our goal to become an even better person and stretch our boundaries by dreaming big. Adjustments are necessary along the way because life isn&#x2019;t always rosy, but it is always worth living. I&#x2019;m here to tell you that no matter what your circumstances may be, as long as you are breathing, you have a contribution to make.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t put a hand on your shoulder to reassure you, but I can speak from the heart. However desperate your life may seem, there is hope. As bad as circumstances appear, there are better days ahead. No matter how dire your circumstances may appear, you can rise above them. To wish for change will change nothing. To make the decision to take action right now will change everything!<br><br>All events come together for the good. I&#x2019;m certain of that because it&#x2019;s been true in my life. What good is a life without limbs? Just by looking at me, people know that I faced and overcame many obstacles and hardships. That makes them willing to listen to me as a source of inspiration. They allow me to share my faith, to tell them they are loved, and to give them hope.<br><br>That is my contribution. It&#x2019;s important to recognize your own value. Know that you also have something to contribute. If you feel frustrated right now, that&#x2019;s okay. Your sense of frustration means you want more for your life than you have right now. That&#x2019;s all good. Often it&#x2019;s the challenges in life that show us who we are truly meant to be.<br><br>A Life of Value<br><br>It took me a long time to see the benefits of the circumstances I was born into. My mum was twenty-five years old when she became pregnant with me, her first child. She&#x2019;d been a midwife and worked as a pediatric nurse in charge in the delivery room where she provided care for hundreds of mothers and their babies. She knew what she had to do while she was pregnant, watching her diet, being cautious about medications, and not consuming alcohol, aspirin, or any other pain-killers. She went to the best doctors and they assured her everything was proceeding smoothly.<br><br>Even still, her apprehension persisted. As her due date approached, my mum shared her concerns with my father several times, saying, &#x201c;I hope that everything&#x2019;s okay with the baby.&#x201d;<br><br>When two ultrasounds were performed during her pregnancy, the doctors detected nothing unusual. They told my parents that the baby was a boy but not a word about missing limbs! At my delivery on December 4, 1982, my mother could not see me at first, and the first question she asked the doctor was &#x201c;Is the baby all right?&#x201d; There was silence. As the seconds ticked by and they were still not bringing the baby for her to see, she sensed even more that something was wrong. Instead of giving me to my mother to hold, they summoned a pediatrician and moved off to the opposite corner, examining me and conferring with each other. When my mum heard a big healthy baby scream, she was relieved. But my dad, who had noticed I was missing an arm during the delivery, felt queasy and was escorted out of the room.<br><br>Shocked at the sight of me, the nurses and doctors quickly wrapped me up.<br><br>My mother, who&#x2019;d participated in hundreds of deliveries as a nurse, wasn&#x2019;t fooled. She read the distress on the faces of her medical team, and she knew something was very wrong.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it? What&#x2019;s wrong with my baby?&#x201d; she demanded.<br><br>Her doctor would not answer at first, but when she insisted on a response, he could offer my mother only a specialized medical term.<br><br>&#x201c;Phocamelia,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Because of her nursing background, my mother recognized the term as the condition babies have when they are born with malformed or missing limbs. She simply couldn&#x2019;t accept that this was true.<br><br>In the meantime, my stunned dad was outside, wondering whether he had seen what he thought he saw. When the pediatrician came out to speak to him, he cried out, &#x201c;My son, he has no arm!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; the pediatrician said as sensitively as possible, &#x201c;your son has neither arms nor legs.&#x201d;<br><br>My father went weak with shock and anguish.<br><br>He sat stunned, momentarily unable to speak before his protective instincts kicked in. He rushed in to tell my mother before she saw me, but to his dismay he found her lying in bed, crying. The staff had already told her the news. They had offered to bring me to her but she refused to hold me and told them to take me away.<br><br>The nurses were crying. The midwife was crying. And of course, I was crying! Finally they put me next to her, still covered, and my mum just couldn&#x2019;t bear what she was seeing: her child without limbs.<br><br>&#x201c;Take him away,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to touch him or see him.&#x201d;<br><br>To this day my father regrets that the medical staff did not give him time to prepare my mother properly. Later, as she slept, he visited me in the nursery. He came back and told Mum, &#x201c;He looks beautiful.&#x201d; He asked her if she wanted to see me at that point, but she declined, still too shaken. He understood and respected her feelings.<br><br>Instead of celebrating my birth, my parents and their whole church mourned. &#x201c;If God is a God of love,&#x201d; they wondered, &#x201c;why would He let something like this happen?&#x201d;<br><br>My Mum&#x2019;s Grief<br><br>I was my parents&#x2019; firstborn child. While this would be a major cause for rejoicing in any family, no one sent flowers to my mum when I was born. This hurt her and only deepened her despair.<br><br>Sad and teary-eyed, she asked my dad, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I deserve flowers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;Of course you deserve them.&#x201d; He went to the hospital flower shop and returned shortly to present her with a bouquet.<br><br>I was aware of none of this until the age of thirteen or so, when I began to question my parents about my birth and their initial reaction to my lack of limbs. I&#x2019;d had a bad day at school, and when I told my mum, she cried with me. I told her I was sick of having no arms and legs. She shared my tears and said that she and my dad had come to understand that God had a plan for me and one day He would reveal it. My questions continued over time, sometimes with one parent, sometimes with both. Part of my search for answers was natural curiosity and part of it was in response to the persistent questions I&#x2019;d been fielding from curious classmates.<br><br>At first, I was a little scared of what my parents might tell me, and, since some of this was difficult for them to delve into, I didn&#x2019;t want to put them on the spot. In our initial discussions my mum and dad were very careful and protective in their responses. As I grew older and pushed harder, they offered me deeper insights into their feelings and their fears because they knew I could handle it. Even so, when my mum told me that she didn&#x2019;t want to hold me after I was born, it was hard to take, to say the least. I was insecure enough as it was, but to hear that my own mother could not bear to look at me was . . . well, imagine how you might feel. I was hurt and I felt rejected, but then I thought of all that my parents have done for me since. They&#x2019;d proven their love many times over. By the time we had these conversations, I was old enough to put myself in her situation. Other than her intuitive feelings, there&#x2019;d been no warning of this during her pregnancy. She was in shock and frightened. How would I have responded as a parent? I&#x2019;m not sure I would have handled it as well as they did. I told them that, and over time we went more and more into the details.<br><br>I&#x2019;m glad that we waited until I was secure, knowing deep in my heart of hearts that they loved me. We&#x2019;ve continued to share our own feelings and fears, and my parents have helped me understand how their faith enabled them to see that I was destined to serve God&#x2019;s purpose. I was a fiercely determined and mostly upbeat child. My teachers, other parents, and strangers often told my parents that my attitude inspired them. For my part, I came to see that as great as my challenges were, many people had heavier burdens than mine.<br><br>Today in my travels around the world, I often see incredible suffering that makes me grateful for what I have and less inclined to focus on what I may lack. I have seen orphaned children with crippling diseases. Young women forced into sexual slavery. Men imprisoned because they were too poor to pay a debt.<br><br>Suffering is universal and often unbelievably cruel, but even in the worst of slums and after the most horrible tragedies, I have been heartened to see people not only surviving but thriving. Joy was certainly not what I expected to find in a place called &#x201c;Garbage City,&#x201d; the worst slum at the edge of Cairo, Egypt. The Manshiet Nasser neighborhood is tucked into towering rock cliffs. The unfortunate but accurate nickname and the community&#x2019;s rank odor come from the fact that most of its fifty thousand residents sustain themselves by combing through Cairo, dragging its garbage there, and picking through it. Each day they sort through mountains of refuse pulled from a city of eighteen million residents, hoping to find objects to sell, recycle, or somehow make use of.<br><br>Amid streets lined with garbage piles, pig pens, and stinking trash, you would expect people to be overcome with despair, yet I found it to be quite the opposite on a visit in 2009. The people there live hard lives, to be sure, but those I met were very caring, seemingly happy, and filled with faith. Egypt is 90 percent Muslim. Garbage City is the only predominantly Christian neighborhood. Nearly 98 percent of the people are Coptic Christians.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been to many of the poorest slums in all corners of the world. This was one of the worst as far as the environment, but it was also one of the most heart-warming in spirit. We squeezed nearly 150 people into a very small concrete building that served as their church. As I began speaking, I was struck by the joy and happiness radiating from my audience. They were simply beaming at me. My life has rarely seemed so blessed. I gave thanks that their faith lifted them above their circumstances as I told them how Jesus had changed my life too.<br><br>I spoke with church leaders there about how lives in the village had changed through the power of God. Their hope wasn&#x2019;t put on this earth, but their hope is in eternity. In the meantime they&#x2019;ll believe in miracles and thank God for who He is and what He has done. Before we left, we presented some families with rice, tea, and a small amount of cash that would buy them enough food for several weeks. We also distributed sports equipment, soccer balls, and jump ropes to the children. They immediately invited our group to play with them, and we had a ball, laughing and enjoying each other even though we were surrounded by squalor. I will never forget those children and their smiles. It just proved to me again that happiness can come to us under any circumstance if we put our total trust in God.<br><br>How can such impoverished children laugh? How can prisoners sing with joy? They rise above by accepting that certain events are beyond their control and beyond their understanding too, and then focusing instead on what they can understand and control. My parents did just that. They moved forward by deciding to trust in God&#x2019;s Word that &#x201c;all things work for the good of those who love God, who are called according to His purpose.&#x201d;</p><h2>This Same Sky: A Collection of Poems from Around the World</h2><p>A multicultural anthology of poems represents the poetic voices, observations, traditions, and stories of people from some sixty countries around the world.</p><p>Grade 9-12-- In the preface, Nye says, ``. . . what lovely, larger life becomes ours when we listen to one another?'' This question states the purpose of this anthology that emphasizes selections from the Middle East, Asia, Africa, India, and South and Central America. They are indexed by country as well as by poet. This is a lengthy collection, close to 200 pages long, brimming with much lovely material. The poems are about many things: the nature of poetry (and language itself), the beauty of the natural world, how feelings about childhood are colored by memory, the love of parent for a child (and vice versa). Some are more political in subject matter. Determining the audience is problematic. The preface states that the poems have been especially chosen for young people, but many of them will be of marginal interest to them, and several require an adult perspective to be appreciated. The book may be useful, but it will have to be introduced by a sensitive adult (preferably a very talented teacher who can lead students to draw connections that may seem unlikely at first). For senior high and public libraries where multicultural material is a priority. --Lauralyn Persson, Wilmette Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Train Wrecks</h2><p>Engravings, photographs, and text recreate spectacular railroad collisions, derailments, boiler explosions, and other disasters primarily during the nineteenth century</p><p>With Train Wrecks, Robert Reed presents a major historic work, amply illustrated to present the full impact of this developmental period of rail transport.</p><h2>The Living Bible Paraphrased</h2><p>Hardcover Publisher: Tyndale House Publishers Edition (1972) ASIN: B0016FT5DQ Product Dimensions: 9 x 6 x 1 inches Shipping Weight: 1.4 pounds</p><p></p><h2>The Polaris Protocol (Pike Logan)</h2><p><b>Retired Delta Force commander Brad Taylor returns with the fifth propulsive thriller in his <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Pike Logan series. </b><br><br>Taskforce operators Pike Logan and Jennifer Cahill are used to putting their lives at risk, but in <i>The Polaris Protocol</i> it&#x2019;s Jennifer&#x2019;s brother and countless more innocents who face unfathomable violence and bloodshed.<br><br>Pike and Jennifer are in Turkmenistan with the Taskforce&#x2014;a top-secret antiterrorist unit that operates outside US law&#x2014;when Jennifer gets a call from her brother, Jack.

He slammed lower behind the outcropping and felt his face, seeing blood on his assault gloves. His platoon leader, First Lieutenant Blake Alberty, threw himself into the prone and said with black humor, &#x201c;You get our asses out of here, and I&#x2019;ll get you another purple heart.&#x201d;<br></p><p>Blackmar said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got nothing else to work with. The eighty-ones won&#x2019;t reach and the Apaches are dry.&#x201d;<br></p><p>Another stream of incoming machine-gun fire raked their position, and Alberty returned it, saying, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in trouble. And I&#x2019;m not going to be the next COP Keating.&#x201d;</p><p>Both from the 25th Infantry Division, they were part of a string of Combat Outposts in the Kunar Province of Afghanistan, ostensibly designed to prevent the infiltration of Taliban fighters from the nearby border of Pakistan, but in reality a giant bulls eye for anyone wanting a scalp. They were attacked at the COP on a daily basis, but followed orders, continuing their patrols to the nearby villages in an effort to get the locals on the government side.</p><p>The mountains of the Kunar province were extreme, and afforded the Taliban an edge, putting the Americans on equal terms. Everything was done on foot, as the mountains negated artillery, leaving the troops reliant on helicopter gunship support. The same thing COP Keating had relied on when it was overrun two years before.</p><p>The incoming fire grew in strength, and Alberty began receiving reports of casualties. They were on their own, and about to be overrun. A trophy for the Taliban. Blackmar heard the platoon designated marksmen firing, their rifles&#x2019; individual cracks distinctive among the rattle of automatic fire, and felt impotent.</p><p>As the forward observer, his entire career had been to provide steel on target for the Infantry he supported. He was the man they turned to when they wanted American firepower, and now he had nothing to provide, his radio silent.</p><p>Alberty shouted, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re flanking, they&#x2019;re flanking! We need the gunships.&#x201d;</p><p>Blackmar was about to reply when his radio squawked. &#x201c;Kilo Seven-Nine, this is Texas Thirteen. You have targets?&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;Yes, yes. What&#x2019;s your ordinance?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Five hundred pound GBU.&#x201d;</p><p>GBU? A fast mover with JDAMs?</p><p>He said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your heading?&#x201d;</p><p>The pilot said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it. I&#x2019;m a BUFF. Way above you.&#x201d;</p><p>Blackmar heard the words, and couldn&#x2019;t believe it. He&#x2019;d called in everything from 81-millimeter mortars to F15 strike aircraft, but he&#x2019;d never called fire from a B-52 stratofortress. Not that it mattered, as the five-hundred pound JDAM was guided by GPS.</p><p>He lased the Taliban position for range, shacked up his coordinates, and sent the fire request. The pilot reported bombs out, asking for a splash. He kept his eyes on the enemy, waiting. Nothing happened.</p><p>Alberty screamed, &#x201c;You hit the village, you hit the village. Shift, shift.&#x201d;</p><p>The village? That damn thing is seven hundred meters away.</p><p>He checked his location and lased again, now plotting the impact danger close as the enemy advanced. He repeated the call with the new coordinates, and waited for the splash.</p><p>Alberty shouted again, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re pounding the fucking village! Get the rounds on target, damn it.&#x201d;</p><p>Blackmar frantically checked his map and his range, shouting back, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m right. I&#x2019;m on target. The bombs aren&#x2019;t tracking.&#x201d;</p><p>The volume of enemy fire increased, and Alberty began maneuvering his forces, forgetting about the firepower circling at 30,000 feet. Blackmar called for another salvo, recalculating yet again. No ordinance impacted the enemy. Thirty minutes later, the American&#x2019;s superior firepower meant nothing, as the fight went hand-to-hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Captain &#x201c;Tiny&#x201d; Shackleford noticed the first glitch when the coordinates on his screen showed the RQ-107 unmanned aerial vehicle a hundred miles away from the designated flight path. Which, given his target area over Iran&#x2019;s nuclear facilities, was a significant problem.</p><p>Flying the drone from inside Tonapah airbase, Nevada, he felt a rush of adrenaline as if he were still in the cockpit of an F-16 over enemy airspace and his early warning sensors had triggered a threat. He called an alert, saying he had an issue, then realized he&#x2019;d lost link with the UAV. He began working the problem, trying to prevent the drone from going into autopilot and landing, while the CIA owners went into overdrive.</p><p>The RQ-107 was a new stealth UAV, the latest and greatest evolution of unmanned reconnaissance, and as such, it was used out of Afghanistan to probe the nuclear ambitions of Iran. It had proven the ability to fly above the Persian state with impunity, and was a major link to the intelligence community on Iranian intentions. Losing one inside Iranian airspace would be a disaster. An army of technicians went to work, a modern day version of Apollo Thirteen.</p><p>They failed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Oglethorpe, the United States Secretary of Defense, said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had forty-two confirmed GPS failures. We&#x2019;ve identified the glitch, and it&#x2019;s repaired, but we lost a UAV inside Iran because of it.&#x201d; </p><p>Alexander Palmer, the National Security advisor, said, &#x201c;Glitch? I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s more than a glitch. What happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The new AEP system of the GPS constellation had a software/hardware mating problem. It&#x2019;s something that the contractor couldn&#x2019;t see beforehand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bullshit. It&#x2019;s something they failed to see. Did it affect the civilian systems? Am I going to hear about this from Transportation?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Only the military signal, but you&#x2019;re definitely going to hear about it from the Iranians. They&#x2019;re already claiming they brought our bird down.&#x201d;</p><p>Palmer rubbed his forehead, thinking about what to brief the president. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a damn. They got the drone, and that&#x2019;s going to be a fact on tomorrow&#x2019;s news. Let&#x2019;em crow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want to allow them the propaganda of saying they can capture our most sophisticated UAV? We&#x2019;ll look like idiots.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone is an idiot.

Time to shut off his iPod, but more importantly, it was his turn in the window seat.</p><p>Only fifteen years old, his passion in life was airplanes and his singular goal was to become a pilot&#x2014;unlike his younger sister, who only wanted the window to aggravate him. She&#x2019;d complained as they had boarded, and his mother had split the difference. She got the window for takeoff, and he got it for landing.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, we&#x2019;re coming into final approach and it&#x2019;s my turn.&#x201d;</p><p>His sister immediately responded, &#x201c;No we&#x2019;re not! He&#x2019;s just talking like he knows what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d; </p><p>Joshua started to reply when the pilot came over the intercom, telling them they had about ten more minutes before parking at their gate in Denver. Joshua smiled instead, just to annoy her. She grouched a little more, but gave up her seat.</p><p>After buckling up, he pressed his face against the glass, looking towards the wing jutting out three rows up, watching the flaps getting manipulated by the pilot. The aircraft continued its approach and he saw the distinctive swastika shape of Denver International Airport.</p><p>A flight attendant came by checking seat belts at a leisurely pace, then another rushed up and whispered in her ear. They both speed-walked in the direction of the cockpit, the original flight attendant&#x2019;s face pale.</p><p>Joshua didn&#x2019;t give it much thought, returning his attention to the window. He placed his hands on either side of his face to block the glare, and began scanning. On the ground below he saw a small private plane taxiing. With as much conscious thought as someone recognizing a vegetable, he knew it was a Cessna 182.</p><p>The Boeing 757 continued to descend and began to overtake the Cessna. Strangely, the Cessna continued taxiing. With a start, Joshua realized it had taken off, directly underneath them. He watched it rise in slow motion, closing the distance to their fragile airship.</p><p>He turned from the window and screamed, &#x201c;Plane! An airplane!&#x201d; His mother said, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>The Cessna collided with the left wing just outside the engine, a jarring bump as if the 757 had hit a pocket of turbulent air. Passengers began to murmur and whip their heads left and right, looking for someone to explain what had happened.</p><p>Twenty feet of wing sheared off as the Cessna chewed through the metal like a buzzsaw, exploding in a spectacular spray of metal confetti, followed by a fuel-air ball of fire.</p><p>Joshua knew the wing would no longer provide lift. Knew they were all dead. </p><p>He was the first to scream.</p><p>The aircraft yawed to the left, seeming to hang in the air for the briefest of moments, then began to plummet to earth sideways. The rest of the passengers joined Joshua, screaming maniacally, as if that would have any effect on the outcome.</p><p>The fuselage picked up speed and began to spin, the centrifugal force slapping the passengers about, one minute right side up, the next upside down, filling the cabin with flying debris.</p><p>Four seconds later, the screams of all one hundred and eighty seven souls ceased at the exact same moment.</p></p><h2>Jennifer: An O&#39;Malley Love Story</h2><p>It&#39;s a summer of change for Jennifer O&#39;Malley.

In this timeless classic, G. K. Chesterton, one of the literary giants of the twentieth century, presents a logical and personal reasoning for Christianity in model apologetic form. Gilbert Keith Chesterton was a self-described pagan at age 12 and totally agnostic by age 16. Yet, his spiritual journey ultimately led to a personal philosophy of orthodox, biblical Christianity. The account of his experiences, <i>Orthodoxy </i>bridges the centuries and appeals to today's readers who face the same challenges of materialism, self-centeredness, and progress. <br><br>"Hope means hoping when things are hopeless, or it is no virtue at all. And faith mean believing the incredible, or it is no virtue at all." <br>--G.K. Chesterton<br><br>A unique book,<i> Orthodoxy</i> addresses our faith struggles and how we communicate our faith to others. Through philosophy, poetry, reason and humor Chesterton leads us on a literary journey toward truth. <br><br>This edition includes a foreword by <b>Philip Yancey</b> who, like C. S. Lewis and other leading Christian writers, found this book to be pivotal his Christian experience. Yancey credits Chesterton with helping to revive and define his faith.</p><p>If G.K. Chesterton's <i>Orthodoxy: The Romance of Faith</i> is, as he called it, a "slovenly autobiography," then we need more slobs in the world. This quirky, slender book describes how Chesterton came to view orthodox Catholic Christianity as the way to satisfy his personal emotional needs, in a way that would also allow him to live happily in society. Chesterton argues that people in western society need a life of "practical romance, the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure. We need so to view the world as to combine an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome." Drawing on such figures as Fra Angelico, George Bernard Shaw, and St. Paul to make his points, Chesterton argues that submission to ecclesiastical authority is the way to achieve a good and balanced life. The whole book is written in a style that is as majestic and down-to-earth as C.S. Lewis at his best. The final chapter, called "Authority and the Adventurer," is especially persuasive. It's hard to imagine a reader who will not close the book believing, at least for the moment, that the Church will make you free. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>In the past few hundred years, some great Christian thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries have penned works of literature that continue to influence Christians today. Rediscover the cornerstones of the Christian faith with these classic works from some of the most influential Christian thought leaders.</p><h2>Reading the Bible with Rabbi Jesus: How a Jewish Perspective Can Transform Your Understanding</h2><p>What would it be like for modern readers to sit down beside Jesus as he explained the Bible to them?

For those who want to know what it was like to be one of Jesus's disciples and sit down with him to study Scripture, Tverberg's new book is the place to start."--<b>David N. Bivin</b>, founder and editor, <i>Jerusalem Perspective</i><i> "The Bible is an Eastern book. We see it through the colored glasses of Western culture. Much is lost. We miss the subtleties of humor andmany of the underlying assumptions.... What lies between the lines, what is felt and not spoken, is of deepest significance." </i><br>(From <i>The Crossand the Prodigal</i>, by Kenneth Bailey)<br> <b>What if you could sit down beside Jesus as he explained the Bible to you? What life-changing insights might emerge?<br></b><br> Vast treasures await us when we read the Scriptures as a native,through the eyes of one of Jesus' first-century Jewish disciples.Combining careful research with engaging prose, Lois Tverberg acts as amaster guide, transporting us across the cultural divide between ourworld and that of the Bible.<br><br> As we begin to understand how theBible "thinks," our own thinking will be transformed as well, and wewill be able to approach God and the stories and teaching of Scripturewith fresh insight. By opening our eyes to the way Middle Eastern people would have understood Jesus, Lois Tverberg takes us on a journey thatwill deepen our love of this very Jewish book, enriching our lives inthe process.</p><h2>A Voyage For Madmen</h2><p><p>On April 22, 1969 -- three months before Neil Armstrong's walk on the Moon -- the world watched as a small sailboat came ashore at Falmouth, England, completing a voyage of astonishing courage and endurance that would forever alter our ongoing adventure with the sea. Ten months earlier, nine very different men had set off in small and ill-equipped boats, determined to do the impossible: sail around the world alone and without stopping, to win the race dubbed the Golden Globe. Only one of the nine would cross the finish line -- to fame, wealth, and glory. For the others, the rewards would be despair, madness, and death.</p><p>The men were inspired by Sir Francis Chichester, who had become a national hero in Britain for stopping only once (in Australia) while sailing alone around the world. Suddenly what had seemed impossible-to circumnavigate the world alone and nonstop -- now appeared within reach. For nine driven men -- among them Robin Knox-Johnston, a young Merchant Marine captain; Bernard Moitessier, a French mystic; Donald Crowhurst, a brilliant, troubled electrical engineer; and Chay Blyth, an Army sergeant who had rowed across the Atlantic in 1966 but did not know how to saila gauntlet had been thrown down, a challenge they found themselves overwhelmingly and inexplicably compelled to accept.</p><p>Though the Golden Globe race was the progenitor of (and inspiration for) the Vendee Globe and the Race of the Millennium, its participants had more in common with Captain Cook and Ferdinand Magellan than with today's high-tech sailor. There was no satellite navigational system, no onboard computer, no cell phone or fax line connecting them to the world beyond -- or to possible rescuers. They survived on their wits and ingenuity, navigating by sextant, sun, and stars. Their most sophisticated technology -- when it worked -- was a radio.</p><p><em>A Voyage for Madmen</em> is a remarkable story of individuals against the sea, of men driven by their dreams and demons to live for months on end in a cabin roughly the size of a Volkswagen. To succeed they must endure the harshest of weather; stave off unimaginable loneliness in the forbidding Southern Ocean; navigate unassisted through the world's most treacherous waters off the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn; and, time and again, face -- alone -- those fateful moments when a single decision could mean the difference between life and death.</p><p>With a novelist's eye for detail and a seaman's knowledge of the joys and perils of blue water, Peter Nichols has crafted a classic tale of endurance and adventure -- a fitting chronicle of how these obsessed sailors, "in their puny and inadequate boats, undertook the last great maritime feat...and how, one by one, the sea cut them down."</p></p><p><p>Peter Nichols is the author of the national bestseller <em>A Voyage for Madmen</em> and two other books, <em>Sea Change: Alone Across the Atlantic in a Wooden Boat</em>, a memoir, and the novel <em>Voyage to the North Star</em>. He has taught creative writing at NYU in Paris and Georgetown University, and presently teaches at Bowdoin College. He is lives in Maine with his wife and son.</p>In the psychedelic summer of 1968, as Apollo 8 soared toward the moon and the Democratic Convention crashed in Chicago, nine men tried finally to accomplish the sailor's age-old ultimate goal: a solo, nonstop circumnavigation of the world. Nichols (Sea Change) deftly introduces myriad aspects of a voyage that promised "dubious, unquantifiable" rewards. He insightfully contextualizes the endeavor as an offshoot of Sir Francis Chichester's famous 1967 solo circumnavigation (with one stop), which represented to England a "longed-for" heroism. Detailing the British media's successful exploitation of the so-called race, he approaches the voyage as the remarkable result of nine men wishing to outdo Chichester. Nichols painstakingly describes the enormous difficulty of solo navigation in the pre-global positioning system of the 1960s. These "hardcase egomaniacs driven by complex desires and vainglory to attempt an extreme, life-threatening endeavor" used only rudimentary equipment and their wits. Nichols is at his liveliest when describing the only two participants who "were really happy aboard their boats": the French-Asian Bernard Moitessier, the most skilled sailor, whose mystical seamanship brings surprises, and the British Robin Knox-Johnson, who was energized during his journey by the memory of "the Elizabethan sea heroes of his youth." Nichols also delivers a compelling portrait of English Donald Crowhurst, an electronics engineer whose "supercharged personality" wreaked havoc on the entire race. While Nichols's pace is neither breakneck nor suspenseful, his careful details and psychological insight make for a riveting account of the triumphant human spirit. 16-page photo insert, 8 maps. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Red Hood: Outlaw Vol. 2: Prince of Gotham</h2><p><b>The Outlaws never thought things would look this bad, as Jason Todd gives in to his addiction to Venom in order to find the missing Starfire in <i>Red Hood: Outlaw Vol. 2: Prince of Gotham</i>!</b><br><br>Jason Todd is the new proprietor of the Penguin's Iceberg Lounge, Gotham's most notorious floating casino/crime front.

When not resting they strutted outside the locked doors of vacated shops, or circled high in the sky, holding clams in their beaks that they soon dropped upon the boardwalk with a splattering cluck. Then they zoomed down and pounced on the exposed meat, pecking and pulling until there was nothing left but the jagged, salty white chips of empty shells.<br><br> By midwinter the shell-strewn promenade was a vast cemetery of clams, and from a distance the long elevated flat deck of the boardwalk resembled a stranded aircraft carrier being attacked by dive-bombers&#x2014;and oddly juxtaposed in the fog behind the dunes loomed the rusting remains of a once sleek four-masted vessel that during a gale in the winter of 1901 had run aground on this small island in southern New Jersey called Ocean City.<br><br> The steel-hulled ship, flying a British flag and flaunting hundred-fifty-foot masts, had been sailing north along the New Jersey coast toward New York City, where it was scheduled to deliver one million dollars&#x2019; worth of Christmas cargo it had picked up five months before in Kobe, Japan. But during the middle of the night, while a number of crewmen drank rum and beer in a premature toast to the long journey&#x2019;s end, a fierce storm rose and destroyed the ship&#x2019;s sails, snapped its masts, and drove it into a sandbar within one hundred yards of the Ocean City boardwalk.<br><br> Awakened by the distress signals that flared in the night, the alarmed residents of Ocean City&#x2014;a conservative community founded in 1879 by Methodist ministers and other Prohibitionists who wished to establish an island of abstinence and propriety&#x2014;hastened to help the sailors, who were soon discovered to be battered but unharmed and smelling of sweat, salt water, and liquor.<br><br> After the entire thirty-three-man crew had been escorted to shore, they were sheltered and fed for days under the auspices of the town&#x2019;s teetotaling elders and ministers&#x2019; wives; and while the sailors expressed gratitude for such hospitality they privately cursed their fate in being shipwrecked on an island so sedate and sober. But soon they were relocated by British nautical authorities, and the salvageable cargo was barged to New York to be sold at reduced prices. And the town returned to the tedium of winter.<br><br> The big ship, however, remained forever lodged in the soft white sand&#x2014;unmovable, slowly sinking, a sight that served Ocean City&#x2019;s pious guardians as a daily reminder of the grim consequences of intemperate guidance. But as I grew up in the late 1930s, more than three decades after the shipwreck&#x2014;when the visible remnants at low tide consisted only of the barnacle-bitten ridge of the upper deck, the corroded brown rudder post and tiller, and a single lopsided mast&#x2014;I viewed the vessel as a symbol of adventure and risk; and during my boyhood wanderings along the beach I became enchanted with exotic fantasies of nights in foreign ports, of braving the waves and wind with wayward men, and of escaping the rigid confines of this island on which I was born but never believed I belonged.<br><br> I saw myself always as an alien, an outsider, a drifter who, like the shipwrecked sailors, had arrived by accident. I felt different from my young friends in almost every way, different in the cut of my clothes, the food in my lunch box, the music I heard at home on the record player, the ideas and inner thoughts I revealed on those rare occasions when I was open and honest.<br><br> I was olive-skinned in a freckle-faced town, and I felt unrelated even to my parents, especially my father, who was indeed a foreigner&#x2014;an unusual man in dress and manner, to whom I bore no physical resemblance and with whom I could never identify. Trim and elegant, with wavy dark hair and a small rust-colored moustache, he spoke English with an accent and received letters bearing strange-looking stamps.<br><br> These letters sometimes contained snapshots of soldiers wearing uniforms with insignia and epaulets unlike any I had seen on the recruit- ment posters displayed throughout the island. They were my uncles and cousins, my father explained to me quietly one day early in World War II, when I was ten; they were fighting in the Italian army, and&#x2014;it was unnecessary for him to add&#x2014;their enemy included the government of the United States.<br><br> I became increasingly sensitive to this fact when I sat through the newsreels each week at the local cinema; next to my unknowing classmates, I watched with private horror the destruction by Allied bombers of mountain villages and towns in southern Italy to which I was ancestrally linked through a historically ill-timed relationship with my Italian father. At any moment I half expected to see up on the screen, gazing down at me from a dust-covered United States Army truck filled with disheveled Italian prisoners being guarded at gunpoint, a sad face that I could identify from one of my father&#x2019;s snapshots.<br><br> My father, on the other hand, seemed to share none of my confused sense of patriotism during the war years. He joined a citizens&#x2019; committee of shore patrolmen who kept watch along the waterfront at night, standing with binoculars on the boardwalk under the stanchioned lights that on the ocean side were painted black as a precaution against discovery by enemy submarines.<br><br> He made headlines in the local newspaper after a popular speech to the Rotary Club in which he reaffirmed his loyalty to the Allied cause, declaring that were he not too old for the draft (he was thirty-nine) he would proudly join the American troops at the front, in a uniform devotedly cut and stitched with his own hands.<br><br> Trained as an apprentice tailor in his native village, and later an assistant cutter in a prominent shop in Paris that employed an older Italian cousin, my father arrived in Ocean City circuitously and impulsively at the age of eighteen in 1922 with very little money, an extensive wardrobe, and the outward appearance of a man who knew exactly where he was going, when in fact nothing was further from the truth. He knew no one in town, barely knew the language, and yet, with a self-assurance that has always mystified me, he adjusted to this unusual island as readily as he could cut cloth to fit any size and shape.<br><br> Having noticed a &#x201c;For Sale&#x201d; sign in the window of a tailor shop in the center of town, my father approached the asthmatic owner, who was desperate to leave the island for the drier climate of Arizona. After a brief negotiation, my father acquired the business and thus began a lengthy, spirited campaign to bring the rakish fashion of the Continental boulevardier to the comparatively continent men of the south Jersey shore.<br><br> But after decorating his windows with lantern-jawed mannequins holding cigarettes and wearing Borsalino hats, and draping his counters with bolts of fine imported fabrics&#x2014;and displaying on his walls such presumably persuasive regalia as his French master tailor&#x2019;s diploma bordered by cherubim and a Greek goddess&#x2014;my father made so few sales during his first year that he was finally forced to introduce into his shop a somewhat undignified gimmick called the Suit Club.<br><br> At the cost of one dollar per week, Suit Club members would print their names and addresses on small white cards and, after placing the cards in unmarked envelopes, would deposit them into a large opaque vase placed prominently atop a velvet-covered table next to a fashion photograph of a dapper man and woman posing with a greyhound on the greensward of an ornate country manor.<br><br> Each Friday evening just prior to closing time, my father would invite one of the assembled Suit Club members to close his eyes and pick from the vase a single envelope, which would reveal the name of the fortunate winner of a free suit, to be made from fabric selected by that individual; after two fittings, it would be ready for wearing within a week.<br><br> Since as many as three or four hundred people were soon paying a dollar each week to partake in this raffle, my father was earning on each free suit a profit perhaps three times the average cost of a custom-made suit in those days&#x2014;to say nothing of the additional money he earned when he enticed a male winner into purchasing an extra pair of matching trousers.<br><br> But my father&#x2019;s bonanza was abruptly terminated one day in 1928, when an anonymous complaint sent to City Hall, possibly by a rival tailor, charged that the Suit Club was a form of gambling clearly outlawed under the town charter; thus ended for all time my father&#x2019;s full-time commitment to the reputable but precarious life of an artist with a needle and thread. My father did not climb down from an impoverished mountain in southern Italy and forsake the glorious lights of Paris and sail thousands of miles to the more opportunistic shores of America to end up as a poor tailor in Ocean City, New Jersey.<br><br> So he diversified. Advertising himself as a ladies&#x2019; furrier who could alter or remodel old coats as well as provide resplendent new ones (which he obtained on consignment from a Russian Jewish immigrant who resided in nearby Atlantic City), my father expanded his store to accommodate a refrigerated fur storage vault and extended the rear of the building to include a...</p><h2>America&#39;s Boating Course Latest Edition</h2><p>3rd Edition with CD</p><p></p><h2>Butterfly Butterfly: A Book of Colors</h2><p><b>Little ones will hover over this colorful look at insect critters as they peek through die-cuts and enjoy a final pop-up surprise.</b><br><br>Lucy sees a beautiful butterfly in the garden, along with a bright green beetle, a brilliant blue dragonfly, some red ladybugs, and many more flying and crawling things.

"I felt like any minute they were going to turn on me."<br><br>"Brushes?" Faith Owens had said when he offered up his bright smile and sales pitch on her icy front doorstep. "I'm sorry, but I've got a little more than brushes to worry about right now. Like wondering if spring is ever going to get here. Because I truly believed it might really be coming when boom--here it is, twenty below zero with a wind-chill factor that would bring Nanook of the North to his knees."<br><br>"Thank you for your time," said the salesman, picking up his case. "You have a pleasant day, now."<br><br>"And what exactly is a wind-chill factor anyway?"<br><br>"Faith," called her husband, Wade, from the living room. "Faith, don't be rude, honey."<br><br>"Well what is it?" she asked, slamming the door with her hip. "What exactly is a wind-chill factor?"<br><br>"This is Minnesota," said Wade, ignoring her question because he wasn't quite sure of the answer. "What do you expect?"<br><br>"Oh, I don't know--maybe a little damn relief?"<br><br>"Might I remind you," said Wade, "how you cried with delight seeing your first snowfall?"<br><br>"I cried with delight the first time I had sex with you, but that doesn't mean I want it nonstop."<br><br>"You're telling me," said Wade with a wistful sigh.<br><br>"Ha, ha, ha," said Faith, surveying her neat and trim husband as he brushed his crew cut with his palm, a gesture he always made after what he thought was a joke.<br><br>It was no surprise to Faith that her husband had less trouble adapting to the frozen north. Hell, he was flying out of it all the time. Right before Christmas, Wade had been transferred to Minneapolis from Dallas, although to Faith, it may as well have been Siberia.<br><br>That very morning he was leaving for a three-day trip with a layover in warm and sunny Los Angeles, and as she stomped upstairs to finish his packing, anger seethed through Faith like steam through their loud and clanking radiators--Los Angeles! In just a few hours Wade could feasibly be lying poolside as some flirtatious Nordic stewardess (why did every Minnesota stewardess she'd seen have to look like Miss Sweden?) rubbed suntan lotion on his shoulders, while she, Faith, rubbed ointment onto the chapped little bottom of their son, Beau.<br><br>She pitched a rolled-up ball of socks into Wade's suitcase with the velocity of a teenage show-off trying to knock down a pyramid of bottles at a carnival booth. There had been a time when she actually enjoyed packing for her husband--when she'd fold his shirts into neat rectangles, slipping a sheet of tissue paper between them so they wouldn't wrinkle; when she'd tuck a love note inside a pair of boxer shorts or dab her perfume on the neckline of an undershirt--but routine had long ago tarnished that thrill.<br><br>Now Faith had an urge to pack a different sort of surprise--perhaps a used diaper from the bathroom pail that reeked of ammonia, or maybe a sprinkling of itching powder.<br><br>She smiled then, remembering one of her more innocent teenage pranks. She and Melinda Carmody had ordered itching powder from the back pages of True Confessions magazine and, sneaking into the classroom during lunch hour, sprinkled it on their algebra teacher's cardigan sweater, draped over the back of his chair. When tyrannical Mr. Melscher (who rewarded wrong answers with a sarcastic "Think again, Einstein") put the sweater on, Faith and Melinda held their breaths in anticipation. Although the man's shirt seemed to have blocked much of the powder's itching powers, he did tug at his collar and squirm a bit, giving the girls far more entertainment than they had trying to figure out if x equaled y.<br><br>Closing the suitcase, Faith sighed, realizing how far removed she was from things like best friends and practical jokes and giggle fits.<br><br>How far away I am from everything fun, she thought--from rides in convertibles with boys who drove with one hand on the wheel and the other one on her; from parties where couples necked on the porches of fraternity houses; from gently turning down, on the same night, two boys who wanted her to wear their pins.<br><br>Who are you kidding? Faith thought, sitting heavily on the bed. You're starting to believe your own press. It astounded her sometimes, the ease with which she assimilated into her present life: how she could get huffy about a visit from a Fuller Brush man or about packing her husband's suitcase as if she were some normal housewife. As if she weren't Primrose Reynolds' daughter.<br><br>She shuddered. It was as if her memories had a geography all their own. In the most recent ones she was on safe and firm ground and was the Faith she wanted and tried hard to be; further back she was the neglected little girl who seemed to be ground zero for lice infestations, the wild teenager who could just as easily have gone to prison as to college. In these memories, she struggled through swamps and quicksand.<br><br>Faith's life had been one of constant upheaval, and if she had learned anything, it was not only how to adapt to it but how to go beyond it. But maybe it was to be the great irony of her life that while she survived years of chaos, a few months as a lonely housewife in the frostbitten north had the power to finally do her in.<br><br>"Stupid godforsaken frozen tundra," she muttered, refusing to trespass in the dangerous territory of her past. As she dragged Wade's suitcase off the bed, she looked out the window laced with frost to see the Fuller Brush man take a tumble on the slippery walkway of her neighbor's house.<br><br>ACROSS THE STREET from the Owens residence, in the big colonial that in Faith's estimation needed a little TLC, Audrey Forrest lay in rumpled sheets, staring at the ceiling. Her five-year-old was bullying her three-year-old, but it was her belief that children settled their differences faster when adults didn't intervene. Besides, she didn't want to get out of bed.<br><br>She stretched her arms to the ceiling, admiring the delicacy of her fingers and wrists. At the moment she was on a diet that called for entirely too many grapefruits and boiled eggs, and until she saw progress on a scale, she would admire those few things, such as her wrists and fingers, that were in no need of size reduction.<br><br>Thinking about her stupid diet, her good, lazy-cat mood faded--why was Paul so adamant that she lose twenty pounds anyway?<br><br>"It'll help you feel better about yourself," her husband had said the other day, handing her the diet paperback he'd bought on his lunch break downtown.<br><br>"I feel fine about myself," said Audrey, piling her thick dark hair on top of her head and posing like a pinup model. She liked her curvy body, ample seat, and full breasts. "And fine about my body." She leaned over, wrapping her arms around Paul's neck. "You usually feel fine about my body." She pressed herself to him, nibbling his earlobe, but what normally drove him crazy now seemed to alarm him, for he pushed her aside as if she were transmitting a germ he did not want to catch.<br><br>"Paul," she said, unable to believe he didn't want to ravish her right there on the kitchen floor, "what do you expect? I'm Italian." In truth, she was mostly Dutch and German, but she felt far more affinity toward the Italian grandfather who spiced up her genetic mix.<br><br>"No," said her husband, looking at her with the glasses he thought made him look like a more experienced attorney than he was. "Gina Lollobrigida and Sophia Loren are Italian." He pulled the sports section out of the paper and snapped it open. "You're just fat."<br><br>"Paul," said Audrey, her voice wounded.<br><br>"Oh, baby, I was just making a little joke."<br><br>"Well, it wasn't funny."<br><br>"I know. I'm sorry. I do think you're beautiful, Aude. It's just that, geez"--he swatted the newspaper he was reading--"every one of these models in here looks like that damned Sticky."<br><br>Audrey had to laugh. "Twiggy, honey. Her name's Twiggy."<br><br>"Well, compared to her, Miss America--which you could be, babe--looks hefty."<br><br>He certainly hadn't been thinking of where her weight fell in the current fashion curve that morning, when he'd pulled her to him, pushing up the fabric of her nightgown until it was a lacy roll around her waist. Audrey had been in the middle of a dream about her grandfather's backyard garden, the place of some of her happiest childhood memories, but she was always welcoming of Paul's advances and kissed him hungrily. After he climaxed, he jumped out of bed, his arms held up to the ceiling, and said, "Thank you, God, for letting me marry a sex maniac!"<br><br>"There are worse things to be a maniac about, wouldn't you say, big boy?"<br><br>Paul didn't turn around to acknowledge her little Mae West impersonation, but skipped off to the bathroom to shower.<br><br>"That's mine! Give it back!"<br><br>A crash accompanied her three-year-old's plea, and then there was a moment of silence before both her children began screaming. Wrapping her robe around her, Audrey got out of bed, ready to seize the day--or the scruff of her children's necks.<br><br>A SUNDAY-SCHOOL TEACHER had once told Merit Iverson that God had held her face in his hands and sculpted it himself. It was true, she had the face of an angel, and had anyone been observing her that morning, it would appear also true that she had the smoking habit of a pool hall hustler. She lit her third cigarette of the hour, dragging on it as if it were oxygen and she were tubercular.

Worldwide, garlic cultivation occupies over 2 million acres of farmland, an area that has more than doubled since 1970. Yet even garlic fanciers may be unable to tell hardneck from softneck, or Purple Stripe from Rocambole, not to mention the hundreds of cultivated varieties grown today, many with distinct differences in taste and character. <br></p><p> In fact, the wealth of garlic varieties in nearly a dozen horticultural groups rivals that of corn, carrots, apples, and peaches. This book is the most comprehensive and in-depth guide available to what surely should be the next gourmet frontier. From 'Ajo Rojo' to 'Zemo', Meredith presents illustrated profiles of nearly 150 cultivars. Detailed chapters cover natural history, the history of garlic in cultivation, the nuances of cuisine and culture, therapeutic benefits, plant structure, how to cultivate, curing and storage, taxonomy, pests and diseases, and chemistry. <br></p><p>Especially useful are the Quick Guides, which summarize information on growing and buying garlic and provide recommendations for the best-tasting cultivars for specific uses and climates. Lists of garlic sources and organizations are a boon to the aficionado. Whether you share Ted Jordan Meredith's "garlic affliction" or just find the pungent bulb indispensable, you'll understand it as never before with this meticulously researched, lovingly written exploration. </p></p><p>Ted Jordan Meredith has written books on viticulture, enology, wine appreciation, garlic, and bamboo.

(Out on the Rim, 1987), are called in to mop up the mess when Hollywood star Ione Gamble is accused of killing her sometime producer/fianc&#x201a; Billy Rice. Gamble's go-between, Enno Glimm, doesn't expect Wu and Durant to vindicate his client legally; he wants them to track down a pair of fly-by-night hypnotherapists who promised to find out whether Gamble could remember anything about the fatal New Year's Eve without reporting directly back to the police. Now they've skedaddled with every indication of having made incriminating videotapes of Gamble revealing all under hypnosis--tapes they're willing to peddle either to Gamble or to the highest-bidding tabloid. Assembling a team that includes aging spymaster Booth Stallings, con man Maurice ``Otherguy'' Overby, and former Secret Service agent Georgia Blue, just getting sprung from a Manila prison, Wu and Durant head out to Malibu and flex their tentacles: Stallings and Blue rent Rice's beach house; Wu puts Gamble into another trance; Otherguy puts out the word that he's looking for nasty videotapes; and the team rents innumerable plush autos they drive to motels where they discover more corpses and predict a final calamity that somehow never arrives. The effortless expertise of WuDu is all a little foolish, of course, but it's hard not to devour the whole outlandish tale at a sitting with a contented smile. Murder, blackmail, double-crossing galore--it all adds up to a delightfully relaxed canter around WuDu's track. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In his 24th book, counting the five he has written as Oliver Beech, Thomas ( Twilight at Mac's Place ; The Fourth Durango ) is in top form; this thriller is stuffed with incident, lively characters and sophisticated wit. On New Year's morning 1991 movie star Ione Gamble is found passed out in the Malibu home of her ex-fiance, a producer who had jilted her. She's holding, and has fired, a gun, killing him, but she can't remember anything because she was wildly drunk the night before. To determine what happened, her lawyer hires an English brother-sister team of hypnotists, who vanish before revealing what they may have gleaned from Gamble. Then the lawyer hires Enno Glimm, specialist in hiring specialists, who hires London-based Americans Artie Wu and Quincy Durant of Wudu, Ltd. And they hire their own helpers: con man Maurice "Otherguy" Overby, academic Booth Stallings and Georgia Blue, a former U.S. Secret Service agent just sprung from five years in a Philippine jail (met before in Out on the Rim ). Once the characters assemble in L.A., the plot takes off, touching down for murder, blackmail, discreet kinky sex and even incest. To this exhilarating, splendidly choreographed caper, Thomas provides a very satisfying ending, capped by a wonderful final line. Not to be missed.

The author of nine bestsellers--including the history-making <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</em>--John Gray expands on the expert advice touched upon in his previous books and distills each message into a powerful, inspiring daily meditation in this newest volume. <p> There's no doubt about it: The relationship between men and women is extremely complex. We often forget just how different the sexes are, and become frustrated and confused by a loved one's behavior. Every day we need to be reminded of these differences and realize that it's okay to be different as long as we recognize and understand the behavior of the opposite sex. In <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days,</em> John Gray provides us with daily inspirations that lovingly and insightfully remind us of the contrasts between Mars and Venus, allowing us to solve conflicts in our relationships.</p><p> Each month is devoted to a single theme, with the daily meditations enlarging on the particular subject at hand. The topics correlate with the very traits of the month itself: January, an exhilarating time of new beginnings, inspires resolve and the desire to excel. In February, when we find ourselves deep in winter's grip and challenged by constant emotional upheaval, we seek reminders of the importance of commitment and the need for patience. May concentrates on such springtime issues as harmony and appreciation. The topics discussed are as diverse as relationships are. </p><p> Inside you'll find comforting and helpful advice on: </p><p></p><ul><li>The true meaning of equality<p></p></li><li> Improving communication<p></p></li><li>Giving and receiving emotional support<p></p></li><li> The awakening of our inner qualities <p></p></li><li> Needing time alone <p></p></li><li> Keeping the passion alive <p></p></li><li> Reacting to stress</li></ul> <p> Whether you need the thoughtful reminders yourself or know a friend or loved one who will benefit from these beautiful reflections, <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days</em> is a classic that no bookshelf should be without. </p><p> The <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus Book of Days</em> contains 365 inspirations to remind you each day of the basic differences between men and women </p><p> Women love a man with a plan; men love a woman with a smile. </p><p> A woman is like a wave. When she feels loved, her self-esteem rises and falls like a wave in motion. When she is feeling really good, she will reach a peak, but then suddenly her mood may change and her wave crashes down. This crash is temporary. After she reaches bottom, her mood will shift suddenly, and she will again feel good about herself. Automatically, her wave begins to rise back up...By recognizing this pattern, a man doesn't take it personally. When he doesn't feel as if he is being blamed for her downs, he can be more supportive. </p><p> A rubber band is the perfect metaphor to understand the male intimacy cycle, which involves getting close, pulling away, and then getting close again...Most women are surprised to realize that even when a man loves a woman, periodically he needs to pull away before he can get closer. Men instinctively feel this urge to pull away. It is not a decision or a choice. It just happens. It is neither his fault nor her fault. It is a natural cycle. </p><p> Romance for women is when a man does things without her having to ask; romance for men is when a woman appreciates the things he does. </p><p> Showing interest is one of the most important secrets to opening a woman's heart. </p><p> A man is free to be the best he can be when he feels accepted just the way he is. </p><p> Women need to work on trusting, while men need to work on caring.</p></p><p>Drawing from his nine bestsellers, including <i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</i>, John Gray has compiled 365 reminders, or "inspirations," designed to help you improve your relationship with your significant other.

It begins as Roosevelt embarks on the New Deal and ends as Kennedy is elected to the presidency. The opening chapters cover the turmoil that proceeded World War II: the Depression, the Spanish Civil War, the Japanese aggression in China, and the relentless spread of Nazi power. WorldWar II dominates the middle section of the volume--as it dominated the lives of those who lived through the period. And in the postwar chapters, Gilbert examines the imposition of the Iron Curtain and the growth of the Cold War, the Berlin Blockade, and eventually dwarfing so much else, the nuclear confrontation. Nationalism remains a feature of this volume as it was of the last -- with the emergence of the "third world" as the European empires collapse, first in Asia and then in Africa. <p>As in the first volume, influential art, literature, and music, as well as epidemics and natural disasters, all have their place. Many of the events described are seen through the eyes and words of those who were present. The author has combed an incredibly wide array of sources to bring to the reader a vivid picture of the life, death, patterns, and flavors of the middle part of the century.</p></p><p>"For virtually every episode described in these pages," Oxford historian Martin Gilbert remarks, "a complete volume could be written." Cramming 19 years into just over 900 pages of text (the maps, photos, index, and bibliography easily stretch the full length over 1,000) is a daunting task, but Gilbert rises to the challenge with a panoramic effort, offering a genuinely global perspective that, coming after several looks back at the "American century," serves as an excellent reminder that there's a whole world beyond the borders of the United States.<p> The Second World War, as one might expect, holds a central position in the text, occupying the entire middle third and exerting a powerful hold over the events preceding and following it. The opening years, for example, contrast the efforts of many world leaders to maintain lasting peace despite the rise of Nazi Germany. The years after the war see Europe--and then the rest of the world--divided up between the two power blocs engaged in a new, "cold" war. Gilbert neatly compresses his theme of the defense of liberty, and the lessons learned in the fight against authoritarian regimes, by noting that "in 1938, Neville Chamberlain had spoken of Czechoslovakia as 'a far-away country of which we know nothing.' Truman said in 1950, 'Korea is a small country thousands of miles away, but what is happening there is important to every American.'"</p><p>Martin Gilbert is Winston Churchill's biographer and the author of eight acclaimed books on the Holocaust.

But this time, Gregor's mother refuses to let Gregor return to the Underland... until the rat Ripred assures the family that Gregor and Boots are needed only for a short meeting, which the crawlers will attend only if their "princess" Boots is present.

The series has been a New York Times bestseller and received numerous accolades. Also a writer for children&#39;s television, Suzanne lives with her family in Connecticut.Kirkus Reviews<br>June 15, 2005<br>For the third time, Gregor and his stolid little sister Boots desend to the Underland in fulfillment of a prophecy, in a story that delivers the breakneck adventure and strong characters readers have come to expect. The Curse of the Warmbloods, it turns out, is a terrible plague that threatens every mammal in the Underland. On their perilous journey to a cure, the questing party (which readers will be delighted to find includes the wonderfully caustic rat Ripred), encounters both Luxa, erstwhile, Queen of Regalia, along with her bat Aurora, and Hamnet, Luxa's long-lost uncle, who has fled humankind to escape its warring ways. Collins keeps the plot moving at warp speed and includes just enough background to bring readers up to speed on the multitude of characters and the political rivalries that unite and divide them. This offering takes on an even darker tone than the earlier ones, delving into meaty questions of territorial expansion and its justification. Although no further prophecy is unveiled at the end to explicitly promise another sequel, readers will surely be hoping for one.<br><br>Horn Book<br>June 6, 2005<br>Just a few months after his previous adventure in Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane ,(rev. 9/04), Gregor,, almost twelve, finds himself deciphering another enigmatic prophecy from the Underland, "a dark war-torn world miles beneath New York City." In this gripping fantasy novel, Gregor and his two-year-old sister Boots embark on their third epic quest in the strange subterranean land, this time to help find a cure for the deadly plague that threatens to wipe out all "warm-bloods"; i.e., mammals. Gregor cares deeply for a number of the Underiand's pale, violet-eyed humans and giant rats and bats, and his mission takes on even more personal urgency when his mother (who, ill-advisedly, has insisted on joining her children in the Underland) is bitten by a plague- infected flea. This immensely readable installment won't disappoint fans of the first two books. In fact, Collins seems to have hit her stride with this page-turner. Character development, plotting, pacing, and description all shine; suspenseful chapter endings propel the story forward to its shocking and sobering conclusion. Battle-weary Gregor and young Boots must leave their mother behind when they return to our world, making the promise of a future visit all the more compelling. K.F.Book Inc.<br><br>School Library Journal<br>July 2005<br>Gr 4-7-This third book continues the saga of Gregor's adventures in the amazing subterranean world under New York City. This time the 11-year-old is trying to save victims of an Underland plague, including Ares, his giant bat bond-mate, and Gregor's own mother. The quest for the cure takes the boy and his friends into new sections of the Underland where plants are carnivorous and a giant lizard serves as a guide. The Overlander is again joined on his quest by Boots, his toddler sister; Ripred, the rat; and Temp, the giant cockroach. As before, the quest is guided by a prophecy that only becomes clear in the later stages of the book. Collins maintains the momentum, charm, and vivid settings of the original title. The characterizations continue to be complex with each new book, revealing new sides to familiar individuals. Fans of this inventive series and new readers alike will be instantly caught up in the action and will look forward to future installments.-Tasha Saecker, Caestecker Public Library, Green Lake, WI<br><br>Booklist. 7/1/05 This third installment of the Underland Chronicles picks up right where Gregor and the Prophecy of BaneG (2004) left off.

She holds a bachelor of science from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and earned her MS in international relations from the London School of Economics. She lives in New York City with her husband and two children.*Starred Review* Ranya Idliby is a Palestinian Muslim; Suzanne Oliver, an ex--Catholic now in the Episcopal Church; and Priscilla Warner, Jewish. Initially, the idea behind establishing a faith club was simple--the three women would collaborate on an interfaith children's book emphasizing the connections among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam that would reinforce the common heritage the three religions share. In post-9/11 America, however, real life began getting in the way. Almost from the start, differences that culminated in conflict emerged; at one point, the tension even jeopardized the project altogether. Prophetically, while searching for a story to help illustrate connections among the religions, Suzanne chose the Crucifixion, which immediately set off alarm bells for Priscilla. Yet they persevered. All three agreed that to work together they had to be brutally candid, "no matter how rude or politically incorrect." Eventually--and as they make abundantly clear, not easily--conflict and anger gave way to a special kind of rapprochement that merged mutual understanding and respect. Each woman brings to the table her prejudices, unique faith stories, and personal stereotypes and misconceptions (Priscilla, for example, had those of one who had never before met a Palestinian woman). Brimming with passion and conviction, and concluding with suggestions for starting a similar faith club, this is essential reading for anyone interested in interfaith dialogue. <i>June Sawyers</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She&#x2019;ll just want to pee and get on the airplane.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell her she can pee on the airplane, it&#x2019;s equipped for that, and she&#x2019;ll save the bother of the Secret Service throwing everybody out of the ladies&#x2019; room at Jet Aviation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pass that on,&#x201d; Ann said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m leaving and I&#x2019;ll be there in ten minutes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let Dino and Viv know, will you?&#x201d; Dino Bacchetti, Stone&#x2019;s old NYPD partner, now chief of detectives, and his wife, Vivian, were coming to the convention with them, and, conveniently, they lived in the same Park Avenue apartment building as Ann.</p><p>&#x201c;Certainly.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone hung up, grabbed his jacket, and followed Fred and the luggage down to the street, where the Bentley Flying Spur sat idling at the curb, Fred already at the wheel. Stone got in. &#x201c;Go. We&#x2019;re picking up Ann Keaton and the Bacchettis on the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Righto, sir.&#x201d; The car glided away. &#x201c;By the way, sir, my New York City gun license arrived in this morning&#x2019;s mail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Congratulations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All I need now is a gun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a gun shop downtown that all the cops use. Joan will give you the address. Take your license with you. And bring me the bill for whatever you choose.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, sir. And please thank Chief Bacchetti for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>HALF AN HOUR after collecting his guests, they pulled to a halt at the Jet Aviation FBO (fixed base operator). Dino, Viv, and Ann went ahead to the airplane while the doorman and a lineman unloaded all their luggage. Stone took the doorman aside. &#x201c;Have you seen a couple of&#x201d;&#x2014;he looked up to see three black SUVs pull into the parking lot&#x2014;&#x201c;those?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see them, Mr. Barrington.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of them contains the first lady of the United States. Please take a couple of carts and whisk her straight through the terminal and onto the G650 on the ramp.&#x201d; He gave the man a hundred, which always brought a doorman to attention.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes indeed, sir!&#x201d; The man grabbed two carts and pushed them quickly toward the caravan.</p><p>Stone waited for Kate to get out of the car and make sure all her luggage was aboard the carts, then she came and kissed him on a cheek. &#x201c;Stone, you&#x2019;re so kind to do this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Save your thanks for Mike Freeman, who&#x2019;s waiting for us aboard the airplane.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t met my secretary, Molly Cannon.&#x201d; She and Stone shook hands. &#x201c;And these are my Secret Service detail, Tom Brennan and Christy Thomas.&#x201d; He shook their hands, too.</p><p>He offered Kate an arm. She took it, and they practically sprinted from the front door to the back door, without attracting too many stares, and out onto the ramp, where the big jet sat, one engine running. The linemen got the luggage stowed while the two Secret Service agents raced aboard and made sure that no members of al-Qaeda were flying with them. Shortly, they were all settled aboard and introduced, and the airplane&#x2019;s other engine started.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry it&#x2019;s not Air Force One,&#x201d; Mike said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Kate said, &#x201c;it will do very nicely. And for purposes of this flight, we can call it Air Force One-point-Five.&#x201d; She took the aisle seat next to Stone and across the table from Ann. &#x201c;May I join you?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something I want to talk to you about while we&#x2019;re en route.&#x201d;</p><p>The airplane began to taxi up the ramp toward Taxiway Lima. As they reached it, Stone saw a dozen jets lined up and waiting for the Gulfstream to take the runway while ground control cleared it for immediate takeoff. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve never seen before,&#x201d; Stone said, nodding toward the waiting airplanes.</p><p>&#x201c;I expect the Secret Service had a word with the tower,&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;They hate my waiting in line on the ground. Somebody might take a shot at us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, that&#x2019;s a thought that had never crossed my mind,&#x201d; Stone said as the Gulfstream began accelerating, pressing him back in his seat. A few seconds later they were climbing and turning to the west.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; Kate said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be cleared direct to Burbank. No routing or delays.&#x201d;</p><p>Twenty minutes later they leveled at cruising altitude, and mimosas were served.</p><p>&#x201c;From now on,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to tell Air Traffic Control that you&#x2019;re aboard all my flights.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Feel free,&#x201d; Kate replied with a big smile.</p><p>Kate Lee waited until they had finished a salad-and-omelet lunch before placing her hand on Stone&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Now,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;to business&#x2014;or rather, to politics.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know from Will&#x2019;s experience at conventions that after our arrival and throughout our stay there will be people who will wish to talk with me who I will wish not to talk with&#x2014;not because I don&#x2019;t like or respect them, but because their messages will sometimes be so important that they are better conveyed through intermediaries. Sometimes my messages to them will fall into the same category. Do you understand?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. It&#x2019;s one of the principal reasons why people have attorneys.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly. On these occasions I will not want a campaign or staff member to act as intermediary. That would add a political edge to conversations that might be better conducted in a more civilian manner. That&#x2019;s why I would like you to represent me on these occasions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would be very pleased to help in any way I can,&#x201d; Stone replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes you may receive messages, at other times you may send them&#x2014;sometimes both.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will always try to alert you when a call will be coming, but I won&#x2019;t always be able to. If someone calls you, that means he very likely got your number from me, so don&#x2019;t blow him off&#x2014;at least, not immediately.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone nodded. &#x201c;So if someone calls me and asks if you would accept the vice presidential nomination . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope it will be me offering it to someone else. But I hear there are other things brewing that may not surface for a few days, so be on the qui vive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t heard that expression for decades.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re making me feel old.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t met my chief of staff, Alicia Carey, have you? She works out of my Washington office.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe I may have shaken her hand on a visit to the White House.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you would have. I hope you will have an opportunity to get to know her this week. When Alicia speaks, she speaks for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep that in mind. I hope you and Will can come to dinner at my house&#x2014;maybe tomorrow evening?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d both like that, but let me clear it with him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And, by all means, bring Alicia and whoever she&#x2019;d like to bring. We&#x2019;ll do a buffet by the pool.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds lovely. Oh, my ears just popped, we must be descending into Van Nuys.&#x201d;</p><p>Molly came over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just had a message&#x2014;the president has landed at Van Nuys and will wait for you there. We&#x2019;re twelve minutes out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Molly, that&#x2019;s good. One caravan is enough.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone noticed that the airplane never turned until it lined up on Runway 34 left. This was the way to travel. They touched down with a nearly imperceptible squeak of tires on pavement, and as they exited the runway, Stone saw the big 747, Air Force One, parked on the ramp, surrounded by people with weapons.</p><p>The Gulfstream came to a stop, the engines died, and the airstair door was opened. Kate was the first out of the airplane and into the arms of her husband.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Stone,&#x201d; the president said, offering his hand. &#x201c;Thanks for giving a girl a lift.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone shook his hand. &#x201c;Hello, Mr. President. Thank Mike Freeman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a wonderful flight,&#x201d; Kate said to her husband. &#x201c;Mike&#x2019;s food is better than ours.&#x201d;</p><p>A line of cars pulled up to the airplane and someone held open the door of the presidential limousine. The Lees got in. Ann kissed Stone goodbye. &#x201c;See you later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got your luggage,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>She and Molly got into the car, following the president, and the procession moved away. Two Bentley Mulsannes from The Arrington moved into place and linemen loaded their luggage. Shortly, they were on their way.</p><p>Stone and Mike took one car, the Bacchettis the other.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you again for taking Kate,&#x201d; Stone said to Mike.</p><p>&#x201c;It was a pleasure having her on board.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve asked them to dinner tomorrow night. And of course Ann and I would like you there, too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mind if I bring a date?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would I mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking of asking Charlene Joiner.&#x201d; She was a big-time movie star who, many years before, had had a brief fling with Will Lee when he was a Senate staffer and still single.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, Mike,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;Charlene&#x2019;s presence near Will seems to put things a bit on edge. Do you know someone else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for understanding. Charlene always seems to have an ax to grind when she sees Will. For the longest time she was trying to get him to commute the sentence of her old boyfriend who was on death row for rape and murder.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And did she get it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but not from Will. When he declined, she moved down a couple of rungs and got herself fixed up with the governor of Georgia, who was happy, after a night with her, to commute the sentence to life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds like Charlene,&#x201d; Mike said.</p><p>They drove on toward The Arrington.</p><p>Security was already tighter than usual at the gate to The Arrington, and Stone, even though he was a major stockholder and board member, was not spared. The search of the cars was thorough.</p><p>The hotel was built on land that had been owned by Arrington&#x2019;s first husband, the movie star Vance Calder, and his house had been incorporated into the guest-arrival center. As part of the lease of the land to the hotel corporation, Stone had negotiated the building of a new house for Arrington. Completed after her death, he had used it as his L.A. base since the hotel opened.</p><p>His car was met by the now elderly Manolo, who had been Vance Calder&#x2019;s butler, and he oversaw the unloading and routing of luggage to the various rooms.</p><p>&#x201c;Drinks in half an hour,&#x201d; Stone said to everybody, and they went to freshen up.</p><p>When he had the opportunity, Manolo approached Stone. &#x201c;A man from the Secret Service was here half an hour ago,&#x201d; the Filipino said.</p><p>&#x201c;Details?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He said he would return to brief you after the arrival of the president,&#x201d; Manolo said.</p><p>Brief him? About what? Stone went upstairs to his bedroom and got into some casual clothes, then he went back downstairs. A man in a suit with a lapel button was waiting to see him.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Barrington, I&#x2019;m Special Agent Mervin Beam of the Secret Service. I&#x2019;m in charge of the L.A. office.&#x201d; They shook hands. &#x201c;May I speak with you in private?&#x201d;</p><p>Stone took the man into his study and they sat down. He didn&#x2019;t bother offering the man a drink since he knew it would be declined. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;It arrived as an e-mail sent to me personally.&#x201d; Beam took a sheet of paper from an inside pocket and handed it to Stone. &#x201c;This is a copy.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone read the message: At some time before the end of the Democratic convention, Katharine Rule Lee will die. We are patriots who have sworn to return the United States to a strict, constitutional republic, and we regard Mrs. Lee as a clear and present danger to her country, since she will slavishly support the criminal policies put into effect by William Jefferson Lee.</p><p>We have supporters in both houses of Congress and in the government bureaucracy, and even in the Secret Service, and we have the means and expertise to carry out our promises. We are quite willing to die in pursuit of our ideals, if that should become necessary.</p><p>There will be nothing you can do to stop us. It was signed, The Patriots.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;WHAT DO YOU make of this?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m no psychologist,&#x201d; Beam said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of this stuff over the years. The writer is probably an individual and there is probably no group involved. He exaggerates or, more likely, simply lies about his support in the Congress and the government.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about his claim of someone in your service?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe that is in the realm of preposterous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And his claim of the means to kill Mrs. Lee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anybody with a gun has the means to kill anybody else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you believe this man is a serious threat or just crazy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Conceivably both, but in any case we will take his threat seriously, as we do all threats.

His particular brand of music first caught the public's attention in the 1960s, when he became something of a chronicler of the American conscience and cultural unrest. His remarkable career in music and literature continues to this day.As a concrete--and hefty--reminder of what has made Dylan such a revered figure in popular music, a new collection of the lyrics of the songs on the 28 albums from <i>Bob Dylan</i> (1962) to <i>Love and Theft</i> (2001) and additional unreleased works has been published simultaneously with <i>Chronicles</i>. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p><h2>Five Great Novels : Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep / Martian Time Slip / Ubik / the Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch / A Scanner Darkly</h2><p>This volume contains DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? (filmed as BLADERUNNER), MARTIAN TIME SLIP, UBIK, THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH and A SCANNER DARKLY. Taken together they represent the best of Philip K. Dick&#39;s unique imagination. In Dick&#39;s writing nothing is what it seems, our sense of the world&#39;s order is fatally undermined and mass media tells us nothing but artful lies. Films such as THE MATRIX and THE TRUMAN SHOW would not have been made but for Philip K. Dick. His work has never been more timely.</p><p>Philip K. Dick (1928-1982) was born in Chicago but lived in California for most of his life. He went to college at Berkeley for a year, ran a record store and had his own classical-music show on a local radio station. He published his first short story, &#39;Beyond Lies the Wub&#39; in 1952. Among his many fine novels are The Man in the High Castle, Time Out of Joint, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.</p><h2>The Lost Amazon: The Photographic Journey of Richard Evans Schultes</h2><p>Richard Evans Schultes (1915-2001) was probably the greatest explorer of the Amazon, and regarded among anthropologists and seekers alike as the "father of ethnobotany." Taking what was meant to be a short leave from Harvard in 1941, he surveyed the Amazon basin almost continuously for twelve years, during which time he lived among two dozen different Indian tribes, mapped rivers, secretly sought sources of rubber for the US government during WWII, and collected and classified 30,000 botanical specimens, including 2,000 new medicinal plants. Schultes chronicled his stay there in hundreds of remarkable photographs of the tribes and the land, evocative of the great documentary photographers such as Edward Sheriff Curtis. Published to coincide with a traveling exhibition to debut at the Govinda Gallery in Washington, D.C., <i>The Lost Amazon</i> is the first major publication to examine the work of Dr. Schultes, as seen through his photographs and field notes. With text by Schultes's protege and fellow explorer, Wade Davis, this impressive document takes armchair travelers where they've never gone before.</p><p>An extraordinary document, as rich in rare, beautiful photographs as it is in the story of a true adventurer, <i>The Lost Amazon</i> chronicles the journeys of legendary explorer Richard Evans Schultes.<br><br>Regarded as the father of ethnobotany and described by his prot�g� Wade Davis as the last of the great plant explorers in the Victorian tradition,&#x201d; Schultes revealed the botanical identity of <i>teonanacatl</i>, the sacred hallucinogenic mushroom known to the Aztecs as the flesh of the gods,&#x201d; through his doctoral research. Soon after, in 1941, he left Harvard for the Amazon, intending to be gone for only a semester. Instead, he disappeared into the rainforest and spent the next twelve years in pursuit of its mysteries. He lived among dozens of local tribes, mapped unknown rivers, sought out sources of rubber for the U.S. government during World War II, collected over 30,000 botanical specimens, discovered over 300 species, and described for the first time the use of over 2,000 medicinal plants.<br><br>As gifted a photographer as he was a scientist, Schultes&#x2019;s exquisite images capture both the lush landscapes of his journey, as well as his deep empathy with the peoples who held him in high esteem; forging strong camaraderie with the local tribes, Schultes almost never carries a firearm, and said, I do not believe in hostile Indians.&#x201d; The Lost Amazon is not only the story of one man&#x2019;s astonishing journey, but also an unrivaled anthropological record.<br><br>Schultes&#x2019;s field notes are accompanied by a biographical essay by Wade Davis that provides personal and historical reflection on his mentor in science and exploration, and a foreword by Andrew Weil, another of Schultes&#x2019;s students. Together with Schultes&#x2019;s own photographs, they provide, for the first time, a visual and written chronicle of astonishing discovery and of a way of life that can never be recaptured.<br>Wade Davis is Explorer-in-Residence at the National Geographic Society. A student and biographer of Schultes, he is the author of numerous books including the best-selling The Serpent and the Rainbow and the recent Light at the Edge of the World . He divides his time between Nova Scotia and Washington, D.C.</p><h2>A Writer at War: Vasily Grossman with the Red Army, 1941-1945</h2><p>Edited and translated from the Russian by Antony Beevor and Luba Vinogradova Knopf Canada is proud to present a masterpiece of the Second World War, never before published in English, from one of the great Russian writers of the 20th century &#x2013; a vivid eyewitness account of the Eastern Front and &#x201c;the ruthless truth of war.&#x201d;<br><br>When the Germans invaded Russia in 1941, Vasily Grossman became a special correspondent for the Red Star, the Red Army&#x2019;s newspaper. <b>A Writer at War</b> &#x2013; based on the notebooks in which Grossman gathered raw material for his articles &#x2013; depicts the crushing conditions on the Eastern Front, and the lives and deaths of soldiers and civilians alike. It also includes some of the earliest reportage on the Holocaust. In the three years he spent on assignment, Grossman witnessed some of the most savage fighting of the war: the appalling defeats of the Red Army, the brutal street fighting in Stalingrad, the Battle of Kursk (the largest tank engagement in history), the defense of Moscow, the battles in Ukraine and much more.<br><br>Historian Antony Beevor has taken Grossman&#x2019;s raw notebooks, and fashioned them into a narrative providing one of the most even-handed descriptions &#x2013; at once unflinching and sensitive &#x2013; we have ever had of what he called &#x201c;the ruthless truth of war.&#x201d;</p><p>Vasily Grossman (1905-1964) came to be regarded as a hero of the Second World War. Life and Fate, his novel about the siege of Stalingrad, was written in 1960 but was declared a threat to the Soviet government and was confiscated by the KGB. Twenty years later it was smuggled out of the Soviet Union on microfilm and published to wide acclaim in the West.<br><br>Antony Beevor was educated at Winchester and Sandhurst. A regular officer in the 11th Hussars, he served in Germany and England. He has published several novels, and his works of non-fiction include <b>The Spanish Civil War</b>, <b>Crete: The Battle and the Resistance</b>, which won the 1993 Runciman Award, <b>Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943</b> and <b>Berlin: The Downfall, 1945</b>. With his wife, Artemis Cooper, he wrote <b>Paris: After the Liberation: 1944-1949</b>. His book Stalingrad was awarded the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-fiction, the Wolfson History Prize and the Hawthornden Prize in 1999.ONE<br><br>Baptism of Fire<br><br>Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union began in the early hours of 22 June 1941. Stalin, refusing to believe that he could be tricked, had rejected more than eighty warnings. Although the Soviet dictator did not collapse until later, he was so disorientated on discovering the truth that the announcement on the wireless at midday was made by his foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, in a wooden voice. The people of the Soviet Union proved rather more robust than their leaders. They queued to volunteer for the front.<br><br>Vasily Grossman, bespectacled, overweight and leaning on a walking stick, was dejected when the recruiting station turned him down. He should not have been surprised, considering his unimpressive physical state. Grossman was only in his mid-thirties, yet the girls in the next-door apartment called him `uncle'.<br><br>Over the next few weeks he tried to get any form of employment he could which was connected with the war. The Soviet authorities, meanwhile, gave little accurate information on what was happening at the front. Nothing was said of the German forces, more than three million strong, dividing the Red Army with armoured thrusts, then capturing hundreds of thousands of prisoners in encirclements. Only the names of towns mentioned in official bulletins revealed how rapidly the enemy was advancing.<br><br>Grossman had put off urging his mother to abandon the town of Berdichev in the Ukraine. His second wife, Olga Mikhailovna Guber, convinced him that they had no room for her. Then, before Grossman realised fully what was happening, the German Sixth Army seized Berdichev on 7 July. The enemy had advanced over 350 kilometres in just over two weeks. Grossman's failure to save his mother burdened him for the rest of his life, even after he discovered that she had refused to leave because there was nobody else to look after a niece. Grossman was also extremely concerned about the fate of Ekaterina, or Katya, his daughter by his first wife. He did not know that she had been sent away from Berdichev for the summer.<br><br>Desperate to be of some help to the war effort, Grossman badgered the Main Political Department of the Red Army, known by the acronym GLAVPUR, even though he was not a member of the Communist Party. His future editor, David Ortenberg, a commissar with the rank of general, recounted later how he came to work for Krasnaya Zvezda, the newspaper of the Soviet armed forces which was far more attentively read during the war than any other paper.<br><br>I remember how Grossman turned up for the first time at the editorial office. This was in late July. I had dropped in at the Main Political Department and heard that Vasily Grossman had been asking them to send him to the front. All that I knew about this writer was that he had written the novel Stepan Kolchugin about the Donbass.<br><br>`Vasily Grossman?' I said. `I've never met him, but I know Stepan Kolchugin. Please send him to Krasnaya Zvezda.'<br><br>`Yes, but he has never served in the army. He knows nothing about it. Would he fit in at Krasnaya Zvezda?'<br><br>`That's all right,' I said, trying to persuade them. `He knows about people's souls.'<br><br>I did not leave them in peace until the People's Commissar signed the order to conscript Vasily Grossman into the Red Army and appoint him to our newspaper. There was one problem. He was given the rank of private, or, as Ilya Ehrenburg liked to joke about both himself and Grossman, `untrained private'. It was impossible to give him an officer's rank or that of a commissar because he was not a Party member. It was equally impossible to make him wear a private's uniform, as he would have had to spend half his time saluting his seniors. All that we could do was to give him the rank of quartermaster. Some of our writers, such as Lev Slavin, Boris Lapin and even, for some time, Konstantin Simonov, were in the same situation. Their green tabs used to cause them a lot of trouble, as the same tabs were worn by medics, and they were always being mistaken for them. Anyway, on 28 July 1941 I signed the order: `Quartermaster of the second rank Vasily Grossman is appointed a special correspondent of Krasnaya Zvezda with a salary of 1,200 roubles per month.'<br><br>The next day Grossman reported at the editorial office. He told me that although this appointment was unexpected, he was happy about it. He returned a few days later fully equipped and in an officer's uniform. [His tunic was all wrinkled, his spectacles kept sliding down his nose, and his pistol hung on his unfastened belt like an axe.]<br><br>`I am ready to depart for the front today,' he said.<br><br>`Today?' I asked. `But can you fire that thing?' I pointed to the pistol hanging at his side.<br><br>`No.'<br><br>`And a rifle?'<br><br>`No, I can't, either.'<br><br>`So how can I allow you to go to the front? Anything can happen there. No, you will have to live at the editorial office for a couple of weeks.'<br><br>Colonel Ivan Khitrov, our tactical expert and a former army officer, became Grossman's coach. He would take him to one of the shooting ranges of the Moscow garrison and teach him how to shoot.<br><br>On 5 August, Ortenberg allowed Grossman to set off for the front. He arranged for him to be accompanied by Pavel Troyanovsky, a correspondent of great experience, and Oleg Knorring, a photographer. Grossman described their departure in some detail.<br><br>We are leaving for the Central Front. Political Officer Troyanovsky, camera reporter Knorring, and I are going to Gomel. Troyanovsky, with his thin dark face and big nose, has received the medal `For Achievements in Battle'. He has seen a lot although he isn't old, in fact he is some ten years younger than me. I had at first thought that Troyanovsky was a real soldier, a born fighter, but it turned out that he had started his career in journalism not long ago as a correspondent of Pionerskaya Pravda [the Communist Youth Movement newspaper]. I was told that Knorring is a good photo-journalist. He is tall, a year younger than me. I am older than the other two, but alongside them I am a mere baby in matters of war. They take a perfectly justified pleasure in regaling me with the forthcoming horrors.<br><br>We leave tomorrow by train. We will travel in a `soft' railway carriage all the way to Bryansk, and from there by whatever transport God sends our way. We were briefed before our departure by Brigade Commissar Ortenberg. He told us that an advance was about to take place. Our first meeting was at GLAVPUR. Ortenberg had a conversation with me and finally told me that he thought I was an author of children's books. This was a big surprise for me, I had no idea that I had written any books for children. When we were saying goodbye I said to him: `Goodbye, Comrade Boev.' He burst out laughing. `I am not Boev, I am Ortenberg.' Well, I paid him back. I had mistaken him for the chief of the publications department of GLAVPUR.<br><br>I have been drinking all day, just as a recruit should. Papa turned up, as well as Kugel, Vadya, Zhenya and Veronichka. Veronichka was looking at me with very sad eyes, as if I were Gastello. I was very touched. The whole family sang songs and had sad conversations. The atmosphere was melancholy and concentrated. I lay alone that night, thinking. I had a lot of things, as well as people, to think about.<br><br>The day of our departure is a lovely one, it's hot and rainy. Sunshine and rain alternate suddenly. Pavements and sidewalks are wet. Sometimes they shine and sometimes are slate grey. The air is filled with hot, stifling moisture. A beautiful girl, Marusya, has come to see Troyanovsky off. She works at the editorial offices [of Krasnaya Zvezda], but apparently she is seeing him off on her own initiative, not at the editor's request. Knorring and I are tactful. We avoid looking in their direction.<br><br>Then the three of us [go to the platform]. I have so many memories of the Bryansky railway station. It's the station I arrived at when I first came to Moscow. Perhaps my departure from it today is my last. We drink lemonade and eat disgusting cakes in the cafeteria.<br><br>Our train pulls out of the station. All the names of stations along the line are familiar. I passed them so many times as a student, going back to Mama, to Berdichev, for my holidays. For the first time in a long while I can catch up on sleep in this `soft' compartment, after all the air raids on Moscow.<br><br>[After reaching Bryansk] we spend a night at the railway station. Every corner is filled with Red Army soldiers. Many of them are badly dressed, in rags. They have already been `there'. Abkhazians look the worst. Many of them are barefoot.<br><br>We have to sit up all night. German aircraft appear above the station, the sky is humming, there are searchlights everywhere. We all rush to some wasteland as far as possible from the station. Fortunately, the Germans don't bomb us here, they only frighten us. In the morning we listen to a broadcast from Moscow. It is a press conference given by Lozovsky [the head of the Soviet Information Bureau]. Sound was bad, we were listening hungrily. He used a lot of proverbs as usual, but they didn't make our hearts feel any lighter.<br><br>We go to the freight station to look for a train. They put us on a hospital train going to Unecha [midway between Bryansk and Gomel]. We board the train, but then suddenly there is panic. Everyone starts running, and firing. It turns out that a German aircraft is machine-gunning the railway station. I myself was caught up in this considerable commotion.<br><br>After Unecha, we travelled in a freight car. The weather was wonderful, but my travel companions said this was bad, and I realised this myself. There were black holes and craters from bombs everywhere along the railway. One could see trees broken by explosions. In the fields there were thousands of peasants, men and women, digging anti-tank ditches.<br><br>We watch the sky nervously and decided to jump off the train if the worst came to the worst. It was moving quite slowly. The moment we arrived in Novozybkov there was an air raid. A bomb fell by the...</p><h2>Illinois, Indiana &amp; Ohio Month-by-Month Gardening: What to Do Each Month to Have a Beautiful Garden All Year</h2><p><p><b>The when-to and how-to schedule for growing, caring for, and maintaining your garden in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio!</b></p> <p>Never garden alone!

The late night call was not unusual for Jackson. Even talk of suicide had the air of ritual about it. Yet there was something in Pollock's voice that Smith hadn't heard before, a harder edge that alarmed him. With his ample Irish charm he tried to calm the distant voice, but Pollock was inconsolable. "Hold on," Smith finally said. "I'll be out." He put down the phone and drove off into the night in the middle of an early spring downpour. It would be hours before he could reach Pollock's house at the eastern end of Long Island--hours in which, knowing Jackson, anything could happen. </p><p>It was March 1952, only two years after Pollock's breakthrough 1949 show at the Betty Parsons Gallery gave the emerging avant-garde art world its first bright, bumptious triumph; only a little more than a year after the vast, luminous landscapes of Autumn Rhythm and Lavender Mist dazzled and confounded the critics; only five years after Clement Greenberg pronounced him "the most powerful painter in contemporary America"; only two and a half years after Life magazine thrust him into the spotlight of America's celebrity-mad postwar media, making him, virtually overnight, American art's first "star." </p><p>As the drive through the darkness and the downpour stretched into its fourth hour, Tony smith must have wondered, as many others had, what strange, reverse alchemy could have transformed so much acclamation into such self-destructive agony. </p><p>Smith knew that Pollock was drinking again. After two enormously productive and relatively dry years--even in the driest seasons he kept cooking sherry buried in the backyard--Jackson had gone back to the bottle. He had always been, in Greenberg's phrase, "an alcoholic in excelsis," but drinking itself was never the problem. Even when it began with beer in the morning and ended with bourbon at night; even when its roots reached back to junior high school, or further, to an alcoholic father; even when his life dissolved, as it had several times over the last twenty years, into a series of drunken binges punctuated by hospitalization, drinking alone could not explain what was happening to Pollock. It couldn't explain the long, plaintive discussions about suicide with friends. "It's a way out," he told Roger Wilcox one day, to which Wilcox replied, "How the hell do you know? You may get yourself into worse trouble." </p><p>Drinking alone couldn't explain why, just a few months earlier, Pollock's new Cadillac convertible--bought as a boast of success--had skidded off a dry road and wrapped itself around a tree. Jackson walked away unhurt, but those who knew him, like Tony Smith, knew that he would try again--and not because of alcohol. There was something behind the drinking that was pushing at Jackson from within, tormenting him, even trying to kill him. Jackson Pollock had demons inside. Everyone could see that. But no one knew where they came from or what they wanted.</p>"In their monumental and impressive biography, Jackson Pollock: An American Saga, Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith strive to achieve nothing less than a full understanding of the complex social and psychological forces that lay behind the work of an artist considered by many to be America&#x2019;s greatest abstract painter."--William Drozdiak, The Washington Post<br><br>"The most thoroughly detailed portrait ever of a U.S. artist. It's as imposing as a history book, as entertaining as a novel and as close as the reader may ever come to sharing the breadth - and sensing the madness - of artistic genius and the genesis of a masterpiece."--David Zimmerman, USA Today<br><br>"Amazing. ...

When the now-crumbling house, &#34;Pandora,&#34; is left to her by her godfather, she returns to spend the summer there with her family. Yet, as soon as Helena arrives at Pandora, she knows that its idyllic beauty masks a web of secrets that she has kept from William, her husband, and Alex, her son. At the difficult age of 13, Alex is torn between protecting his beloved mother, and growing up. And equally, desperate to learn the truth about his real father. When, by chance, Helena meets her childhood sweetheart, a chain of events is set in motion that threatens to make her past and present collide. Both Helena and Alex know that life will never be the same, once Pandora&#39;s secrets have been revealed . . .</p><p><b>Lucinda Riley </b>is the internationally bestselling author of such titles as <i>The Orchid House</i>, <i>The Girl on the Cliff</i>, <i>The Lavender Garden</i>, and <i>The Seven Sisters</i>.

Barrie worked on the story of Peter Pan as he appeared through different incarnations: the three-act play <em>Peter Pan, or the Boy who Wouldn&#x2019;t Grow Up</em> (1904), the illustrated novella <em>Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</em> (1906), the Epilogue to the play &#x201c;An After Thought&#x201d; (1908), the full-length novel <em>Peter and Wendy</em> (1911), two short stories, and finally a longer version of the original play. This edition of <em>Peter Pan</em> includes not only the novel and revised play as they were first published, but also an earlier novella and the previously unpublished original play. </p> <p> Appendices include materials from Barrie&#x2019;s personal writings and contemporary reviews and illustrations. </p></p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens have dominated bestseller lists with books denigrating religious belief as dangerous foolishness. And these authors are merely the leading edge of a far larger movement&#x2013;one that now includes much of the scientific community.<br><br>&#x201c;The attack on traditional religious thought,&#x201d; writes David Berlinski in <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Delusion</i>, &#x201c;marks the consolidation in our time of science as the single system of belief in which rational men and women might place their faith, and if not their faith, then certainly their devotion.&#x201d;<br><br>A secular Jew, Berlinski nonetheless delivers a biting defense of religious thought. An acclaimed author who has spent his career writing about mathematics and the sciences, he turns the scientific community&#x2019;s cherished skepticism back on itself, daring to ask and answer some rather embarrassing questions:<br><br>Has anyone provided a proof of God&#x2019;s inexistence?<br>Not even close.<br><br>Has quantum cosmology explained the emergence of the universe or why it is here?<br>Not even close.<br><br>Have the sciences explained why our universe seems to be fine-tuned to allow for the existence of life?<br>Not even close.<br><br>Are physicists and biologists willing to believe in anything so long as it is not religious thought?<br>Close enough.<br><br>Has rationalism in moral thought provided us with an understanding of what is good, what is right, and what is moral?<br>Not close enough.<br><br>Has secularism in the terrible twentieth century been a force for good?<br>Not even close to being close.<br><br>Is there a narrow and oppressive orthodoxy of thought and opinion within the sciences?<br>Close enough.<br><br>Does anything in the sciences or in their philosophy justify the claim that religious belief is irrational?<br>Not even ballpark.<br><br>Is scientific atheism a frivolous exercise in intellectual contempt?<br>Dead on.<br><br>Berlinski does not dismiss the achievements of western science. The great physical theories, he observes, are among the treasures of the human race. But they do nothing to answer the questions that religion asks, and they fail to offer a coherent description of the cosmos or the methods by which it might be investigated.<br><br>This brilliant, incisive, and funny book explores the limits of science and the pretensions of those who insist it can be&#x2013;indeed must be&#x2013;the ultimate touchstone for understanding our world and ourselves.</p><p>DAVID BERLINSKI has a Ph.D. from Princeton University and has taught mathematics and philosophy at universities in the United States and in France.

Anne Perry lives in Scotland and Los Angeles.Charles Latterly stared across the untroubled sea at the shore they were fast approaching. The mountain rose sharply, as symmetrical and uncomplicated as a child&#x2019;s drawing. The sky above was midwinter blue. At home in England they would be expecting snow at this time in December, but here, so close to Sicily, the wind off the salt water was mild. The small boat barely rocked.<br><br>He had been looking forward to this break from the reality of London, work and the routine of his life, which lately had seemed more meaningless than ever. The recent death of his wife had given him an acute feeling of loss, but not in the way he had expected. There was no deep ache of bereavement. It forced him to realize that perhaps he had felt alone for a long time.<br><br>Would three weeks on Stromboli, a volcanic island in the Tyrrhenian, accomplish anything, change anything inside him? Would it heal the sense of helplessness, the bitterness of endless small failures? Maybe. It would certainly give him a long time to think, uninterrupted by the petty details of life.<br><br>He was in his midforties, yet he felt old.<br><br>They were almost at the shore. He could see men on the wharfs busy unloading fishing boats. There were small houses along the front, and streets leading inland, climbing quite steeply. It all looked simple and homely, probably much as it had done for two thousand years or more.<br><br>The mountain was bigger than it had seemed at a distance. It towered above them, almost bare of vegetation except for patches of grass. The terrain looked smooth, even gentle from here.<br><br>It was time to pay attention to landing. The boat was only feet away from the wharf edge. Ropes were tossed and made fast. A man shouted in broken English for Charles to get out, to hold on so he didn&#x2019;t slip. They were all cheerful, smiling to make up for the words they didn&#x2019;t know.<br><br>Charles thanked the men in polite English, and accepted a steadying hand so as not to fall on the wet stones. He should make an effort to learn a little Italian. It would be a courtesy.<br><br>Someone passed him up his case. He had brought only the necessities: a minimum of clothes, a pair of boots, toiletries, and a couple of books. His intention was to spend his time walking as much as possible.<br><br>He knew that the hostelry where he was staying was quite remote and a long way from the port village&#x2014;�too far to walk with a case&#x2014;�so he hired a pony cart and driver to take him up the side of the mountain.<br><br>It was a pleasant ride, although the rough roads were quite steep in places. As they moved away from the water&#x2019;s edge, Charles realized that the landscape was actually far more varied than he had thought. The central cone of the volcano was not as symmetrical as it had seemed from below, at sea. It towered above them, bare toward the top, as if shorn of its grass and shrubs. Yet it had a kind of beauty that was brave but also almost barbaric.<br><br>His driver nodded. &#x201c;She sleep now,&#x201d; he said, showing gaps in his teeth as he smiled. &#x201c;She wake up. You see.&#x201d;<br><br>Charles thought that he would rather not, but it would be impolite to say so. They were passing through rolling grassy country now. He imagined that in the spring and summer it would be full of flowers and butterflies, probably bees. A good place to walk.<br><br>They passed a few small settlements, some of whose narrow streets were cobbled, others, merely dry earth. The limestone houses were whitewashed. They looked as if they had been there forever. Women were busy with picking herbs or gathering in laundry. Children played, running and hiding, fighting with sticks for swords. Old men stood by a fountain on the street corner and stopped their conversation long enough to look briefly at the passersby.<br><br>As they drove, the driver gave commentary Charles did not understand, though he smiled and nodded at suitable intervals. He was relieved when they finally arrived at the low, rambling house well beyond the villages that was to be his home for the next three weeks.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said as the man handed him his case. He paid the agreed amount and, as the pony and cart set off back toward the shore, he turned to look for his host.<br><br>The low midwinter sun cast a warm light on the stone house, slight shadows hiding blemishes and giving it an infinitely comforting look.<br><br>Then a man came out of the door and hurried toward him, a broad smile on his face, his hand held out.<br><br>&#x201c;I am Stefano,&#x201d; he said cheerfully. &#x201c;You must be Signor Latterly, yes? Good. Welcome to Stromboli. Is beautiful, yes?&#x201d; He waved his arm in a broad sweep to include the huge, looming mountain and the arch of the sky, which was already darkening in the east. The fire of sunset in the west was painting the sea with color. A faint wind stirred, carrying the scent of the grasses.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it is,&#x201d; Charles said quickly. &#x201c;I look forward to exploring.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tomorrow,&#x201d; Stefano agreed. &#x201c;You have come a long way. Now you are tired. You eat. I have something for you. I show you your room. Yes? Come.&#x201d; Without waiting for Charles to reply, he led the way past the front of the house, along a small passage between buildings, and out into a courtyard with a bubbling fountain in it.<br><br>Charles had no time to look at it or admire the stone fish that formed its base. Stefano briskly led him into another open-�air passage at the far side of the courtyard and opened the second door along.<br><br>&#x201c;This is your room,&#x201d; he said with a flourish. &#x201c;You are welcome. Kitchen is that way.&#x201d; He pointed. &#x201c;Come when you are ready. I make you something to eat, yes?&#x201d; He patted his ample stomach. &#x201c;Nobody sleep well empty. Not good. I look after you, you leave Stromboli a new man!&#x201d; He smiled widely. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes . . . yes, please,&#x201d; Charles accepted, walking past Stefano and inside. He set his case down, staring around him. The room was small, containing a bed, a table and chair, and a washstand. There was also one chest of drawers and a makeshift closet composed of several hooks behind a curtain. The floor was tiled in a warm earth shade. There was a bathroom through a small door, to be shared with his immediate neighbor. He did not care for that, but it was acceptable. It was all immaculately clean.

The Irish-American folk and popular songs featured complement the text, highlighting issues immigrants faced and the social conditions they experienced from the 1700s to the early twentieth century. They tell of the backbreaking task of survival in the New World; the battles waged for fair treatment and fair pay for the work done by these immigrants on railroads, on canals, and in mines, construction, and factories; the success that they ultimately attained in politics, business, and society; and their continuing influence on American life and culture.</p><p>Mick Moloney, a native of Limerick, was part of the &#39;60s folk revival in Ireland and has recorded more than 40 albums/tapes/CDs. A college professor, arts administrator, radio and TV personality, he has received numerous accolades and was twice named one of the &#34;Top 100 Irish Americans&#34; by Irish America magazine. A frequent and respected contributor to academic journals, he performs regularly on radio and TV as well as touring and performing extensively.St. Patrick's Day is fast approaching, and millions of Americans will be gathering to celebrate their Irish heritage. Most of them would have difficulty naming any Irish song beyond "Danny Boy" which is ironic considering that the songwriter was an Oxford-educated English barrister who never set foot outside his native country. In a rambling but entertaining narrative, actor McCourt (Singing My Him Song) explores not only the 1913 marriage of Frederick Weatherly's lyrics to the Derry Air but also the origins of the music, the continuing attraction of the song, and even the mystery of the narrator. Who is bidding farewell to Danny? Is it his father? His mother? Perhaps his homosexual lover? All are weighed and evaluated with the kind of attention devoted to sacred texts. The work concludes with a select discography, including performances by Papa John Creech, Bing Crosby, and Elvis Presley, among others. One person who could name any number of Irish songs is ethnomusicologist and acclaimed Irish singer Moloney (Ph.D., Univ. of Pennsylvania). Drawing on Irish and Irish American songs to illustrate the tale, Moloney surveys the experiences of Irish immigrants to 1900. His brief book includes song lyrics and specific song histories and is accompanied by an 18-song CD. Using music as a framework, Moloney explores why Irish Catholics and Protestants left the old country and their respective lives once they landed here. Concentrating primarily on Irish Catholics, Moloney's text focuses on Irish encounters with prejudice ("no Irish need apply") and the post-Civil War transition into the middle class. It is an oft-told tale but one that Moloney hopes will inform contemporary Irish Americans confronting a new generation of immigrants. McCourt's book is recommended for popular song collections in public libraries, while Moloney's should find a place in history and popular culture collections.

Rather than burdening the reader with difficult or arcane references and arguments, he writes of familiar feelings and situations and allows the theology to unfold naturally. In <i>First Comes Love</i>, Hahn turns his attention to the search for a sense of belonging, revealing the intimate connection between the families men and women create on earth and the divine family, the Holy Trinity. <br><br>Delving into the Gospels, Hahn shows that family terminology--words like <i>brother</i>, <i>sister</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>father</i>, and <i>home</i>--dominates Jesus' speech and the writings of His first followers, and that these very words illuminate Christianity's central ideas. As he explores the fatherhood of God, the marriage of the Church to Christ, and the all-enveloping role of the Holy Spirit, Hahn deepens readers' understanding of the sacraments, teaches them how to create a family life in the image of the Trinity, and demonstrates the ways in which the analogy of the family applies to every aspect of Catholicism and its practices--from the role of "father" embodied by the ancient patriarchs and contemporary parish priests, to the comfort and guidance offered by the brothers and sisters who comprise the Communion of Saints, to the nurturing embrace of Mary, the mother of all Christians. <br><br>Through real-life examples (both humorous and compassionate) and quotations drawn from the Scriptures, Hahn makes it clear that no matter what sort of family readers come from--no matter what sort of "dysfunction" they have experienced--they can find a family in the Church. Reaching out to newcomers and to lifelong Christians alike, <i>First Comes Love </i>is an invitation to discover a true home in the divine.</p><p>Scott Hahn, in <i>First Comes Love</i>, uses the idea of family to explain Catholic thought about the Trinity. Hahn believes that the relations among the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are a model for the relations among every nuclear unit composed of father, mother, and child. And he believes that the family of the Church helps people emulate the Trinitarian family and can heal them when they fall short of such holiness. Hahn moves easily from personal anecdote to Scriptural analysis, making his case that Jesus understood all of humanity as part of one family when he called his followers brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers. <i>First Comes Love</i> makes the salutary point that neither romance nor parenthood alone can give us a sufficient sense of belonging. "God built us all to live in a much larger family, to experience a much larger love ... a love that extends infinitely." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"Hahn reflects simply yet profoundly on the nitty-gritty of life, love, relationships, marriage, and family in the context of the bedrock doctrines of Christian Faith. His retelling of the story of our salvation in Jesus Christ opens up to the truth of our origin and destiny in the one God, a Trinity of divine Persons who abide in a communion of love--a love stronger than sin and death. This book is full of good news and solid answers to life&#x2019;s tough questions."<br>--Most Reverend Charles J. Chaput, OFM Cap., Archbishop of Denver<br><br>"It is a joy to recommend this most recent accomplishment of Scott Hahn to anyone looking for a faith-filled, Spirit-driven, and completely delightful exposition of the meaning of family in all of its divine and human implications." <br>--Most Reverend Donald W.

The color of the endpapers--deep yellow--tells readers that even the book designers know with which end of the color spectrum most viewers associate this sensuous painter. The translucent-looking, sun-struck, golden woman in the bathtub--the artist's wife and favorite model--is so emblazoned on our memories that it takes an exhibition like the one documented in this book to remind viewers of Bonnard's extraordinary range as a colorist.<p> The early, intimate, Nabi paintings are often dark, with figures that stand out like candle flames in shadowy interiors. But Bonnard's use of umber, sienna, and various blacks--occasionally in the shape of a dachshund--is forever part of what makes those brilliant reds and oranges sing. Even 60 years into his career, the painter gave full range to his palette, balancing the most highly colored canvasses with others of pale, soft grays. Those readers who have been succored on the 1984 Phillips Collection catalogue will find MoMA's new one every bit as nourishing.</p>Yves-Alain Bois is Professor of Art History at Harvard University and has written extensively on modern art.

Their fleeting encounter in 1747 signals a unique moment in history where belief collided with the cold certainty of reason. Set at the tipping point between the ancient and modern world,&nbsp;<em>Evening in the Palace of Reason</em>&nbsp;captures the tumult of the eighteenth century, the legacy of the Reformation, and the birth of the Enlightenment in this extraordinary tale of two men.</p><p>In his lively history, <i>Evening in the Palace of Reason</i>, James R. Gaines sets two remarkable--and remarkably different--historical figures on a collision course toward a single night in Potsdam in 1747: the composer Johann Sebastian Bach--"old Bach," as he was called then at the age of 62--and the still-young Prussian king, Frederick II, already known as Frederick the Great after less than a decade on the throne. Having long employed old Bach's son Carl--a more celebrated composer at the time--Frederick summoned the father from Leipzig and challenged him, with an offhanded cruelty, to a public compositional puzzle designed to humiliate the great wizard of the waning art of counterpoint.<p> Gaines is a pleasant guide through the incestuous patchwork monarchies of middle Europe, with a breezy tone fitting for a former editor of <i>People</i>. ("The Hohenzollerns were a funny bunch," he writes at one point.) But he is also a passionately learned student of the intricacies of the era's musical theories and the secret languages of its coded compositions. (One is thankful that he and his publisher resisted calling the book <i>The Bach Code</i>.) Gaines leads up to his pivotal encounter with a double biography of his two principals, told in alternating chapters. Bach's mostly homebound life, which left few documents for historians, is often no match for the grotesque dramas of Frederick's parallel story, which climaxes when his father the king forces Frederick to witness the execution of his best friend (and perhaps lover). The weight that keeps the two stories in balance is the genius of Bach's work, particularly the masterful <i>Musical Offering</i> that he composes in response to the king's challenge. The encounter itself may not bear the full burden that Gaines wants to give it, as a clash between two epochal worldviews, the faith of the Reformation versus the rationalism of the Enlightenment, but the two life stories he so vividly describes make the journey there more than worthwhile. <i>--Tom Nissley</i></p><blockquote><p>One Sunday evening in the spring of his seventh year as king, as his musicians were gathering for the evening concert, a courtier brought Frederick the Great his usual list of arrivals at the town gate. As he looked down the list of names, he gave a start.</p><p>"Gentlemen," he said, "old Bach is here." Those who heard him said there was "a kind of agitation" in his voice.</p></blockquote><p>So begins <strong>James R. Gaines</strong>'s <strong>Evening in the Palace of Reason</strong>, setting up what seems to be the ultimate mismatch: a young, glamorously triumphant warrior-king, heralded by Voltaire as the very It Boy of the Enlightenment, pitted against a devout, bad-tempered composer of "outdated" music, a scorned genius in his last years, symbol of a bygone world. The sparks from their brief conflict illuminate a pivotal moment in history.</p><p>Behind the pomp and flash, Prussia's Frederick the Great was a tormented man. His father, Frederick William I, was most likely mad; he had been known to chase frightened subjects down the street, brandishing a cane and roaring, "Love me, scum!" Frederick adored playing his flute as much as his father despised him for it, and he was beaten mercilessly for this and other perceived flaws. After an unsuccessful attempt to escape, Frederick was forced to watch as his best friend and coconspirator was brutally executed.</p><p>Twenty years later, Frederick's personality having congealed into a love of war and a taste for manhandling the great and near-great, he worked hard and long to draw "old Bach" into his celebrity menagerie. He was aided by the composer's own son, C. P. E. Bach, chief keyboardist in the king's private chamber music group. The king had prepared a cruel practical joke for his honored guest, asking him to improvise a six-part fugue on a theme so fiendishly difficult some believe only Bach's son could have devised it. Bach left the court fuming. In a fever of composition, he used the coded, alchemical language of counterpoint to write A Musical Offering in response. A stirring declaration of everything Bach had stood for all his life, it represented "as stark a rebuke of his beliefs and worldview as an absolute monarch has ever received." It is also one of the great works of art in the history of music.</p><p>Set at the tipping point between the ancient and the modern world, the triumphant story of Bach's victory expands to take in the tumult of the eighteenth century: the legacy of the Reformation, wars and conquest, and the birth of the Enlightenment. Most important, it tells the story of that historic moment when Belief -- the quintessentially human conviction that behind mundane appearances lies something mysterious and awesome -- came face to face with the cold certainty of Reason. Brimming with originality and wit, <strong>Evening in the Palace of Reason</strong> is history of the best kind, intimate in scale and broad in its vision.</p></p><h2>Wee Sing America</h2><p><br>From the land of the free and the home of the brave, Americans are explorers and dreamers... and writers of song.

With his signature wealth of compassion and insight, C.S. Lewis offers answers to these crucial questions and shares his hope and wisdom to help heal a world hungry for a true understanding of human nature.</p><p><i>The Problem of Pain</i> answers the universal question, "Why would an all-loving, all-knowing God allow people to experience pain and suffering?" Master Christian apologist C.S. Lewis asserts that pain is a problem because our finite, human minds selfishly believe that pain-free lives would prove that God loves us. In truth, by asking for this, we want God to love us less, not more than he does. "Love, in its own nature, demands the perfecting of the beloved; that the mere 'kindness' which tolerates anything except suffering in its object is, in that respect at the opposite pole from Love." In addressing "Divine Omnipotence," "Human Wickedness," "Human Pain," and "Heaven," Lewis succeeds in lifting the reader from his frame of reference by artfully capitulating these topics into a conversational tone, which makes his assertions easy to swallow and even easier to digest. Lewis is straightforward in aim as well as honest about his impediments, saying, "I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain hurts. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine that being made perfect through suffering is not incredible. To prove it palatable is beyond my design." The mind is expanded, God is magnified, and the reader is reminded that he is not the center of the universe as Lewis carefully rolls through the dissertation that suffering is God's will in preparing the believer for heaven and for the full weight of glory that awaits him there. While many of us naively wish that God had designed a "less glorious and less arduous destiny" for his children, the fortune lies in Lewis's inclination to set us straight with his charming wit and pious mind. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Why must humanity suffer? In this elegant and thoughtful work, C.S. Lewis questions the pain and suffering that occur everyday and how this contrasts with the notion of a God that is both omnipotent and good -- the answer to this critical theological problem is within these pages.</p><h2>Starlight (Breyer Stablemates)</h2><p>This brand-new series of easy readers features Breyer horses, the renowned collectible horse figurines!<br><br>In A Foal for Haley, Haley has her hands full<br>with Starlight, her mischievous, disobedient foal.<br>But one scary night, Starlight gets lost in the woods,<br>and Haley makes a special wish--to find her beloved foal.<br>Her wish comes true, and from then on they're friends forever.<br><br>For years, Breyer has been known for making high-quality collectible horses.

Packed with 1,000 recipes that are seductive, sexy, and utterly delicious, <i>Passionate Vegetarian</i> covers all the bases of meatless cooking, from east (Stir Fry of Asparagus with Black Bean-Ginger Sauce), west (Talk of the Town Barbecued Tofu), from the Mediterranean (Swiss Chard with Raisins, Onions &amp; Olives) to the American South (Black-Eyed Pea Ragovt). You'll find lush lasagnas; plump pierogies; bountiful burgers, beans, and breads; pleasing pasta and pies. You'll spoon up soups and stews, and delight in desserts from simple to swoonworthy.<br><br>Written by longtime vegetarian Crescent Dragonwagon, author of <i>Dairy Hollow House Soup &amp; Bread Cookbook</i>, <i>Passionate Vegetarian</i> employs innovative methods (try "Ri-sort-ofs," in which risotto technique is used to create splendid, richly flavored grain dishes built around not just rice but also barley, buckwheat, spelt, and even toasted oats with an array of seasonings) and introduces lesser-known ingredients (get to know and love not just tofu and tempeh but a whole new generation of soyfoods, as well as "Quick Fixes" like instant bean flakes). Opinionated, passionate, and deeply personal, Ms. Dragonwagon's tantalizing headnotes will have readers rushing to the kitchen to start cooking. (Can her over-the-top Garlic Spaghetti really be that good? It is.)<br><br>Whether you're a committed vegetarian, a dedicated vegan (most recipes offer low-fat and vegan options), or a food-loving omnivore in search of something new and wonderful, this is not just vegetarian cooking--but cooking, period--at its most creative, inspiring, and exuberant.</p><p>Crescent Dragonwagon shares a wealth of recipes and memories with humor and intelligence in her extraordinary <i>Passionate Vegetarian</i>. She promises that "here you will be well fed, well loved, well tended to, satisfied," and 1,000-plus recipes later, that's exactly what's delivered.<p>For 18 years Dragonwagon owned and ran a country inn, where she fed glorious food to everyone including vegetarians, diabetics, the lactose intolerant, and people with food allergies. But the real draw here is that this is vegetarian cooking for everyday living. Ingredient lists are always reasonable and understandable; you won't have to search high and low for something esoteric that'll make or break a recipe. This is comfort food that's easy to prepare, and that deprives you of nothing. If you're not a full-time vegetarian, this is the biggest book of potential starters and side dishes you'll ever see.</p><p>Dragonwagon's "swoon-worthy, knock-your-socks-off, delicious food" includes hors d'oeuvres; salads; soups; stews; layered dishes; dishes that star grains, beans, or soy; recipes for every vegetable imaginable; burgers and patties; quick dishes; and desserts. From the simple Melissa's Spinach Casserole and Susie Pryor's beautifully impressive "Perfectly Delicious" Stuffed Acorn Squash to the vibrant Stir-Fry of Asparagus with Black Bean-Ginger Sauce and Mr. Panseer's North-Indian-Style Spinach, Dragonwagon offers flavors and cooking techniques from all over the world--everything from old favorites to new twists.

(Acting Edition for Theater Productions)</h2><p>In a plantation house, a family celebrates the sixty-fifth birthday of Big Daddy, as they sentimentally dub him. The mood is somber, despite the festivities, because a number of evils poison the gaiety: greed, sins of the past and desperate, clawing hopes for the future spar with one another as the knowledge that Big Daddy is dying slowly makes the rounds. Maggie, Big Daddy&#39;s daughter-in-law, wants to give him the news that she&#39;s finally become pregnant by Big Daddy&#39;s favorite son, Brick, but Brick won&#39;t cooperate in Maggie&#39;s plans and prefers to stay in a mild alcoholic haze the entire length of his visit. Maggie has her own interests at heart in wanting to become pregnant, of course, but she also wants to make amends to Brick for an error in judgment that nearly cost her her marriage. Swarming around Maggie and Brick are their intrusive, conniving relatives, all eager to see Maggie put in her place and Brick tumbled from his position of most-beloved son. By evening&#39;s end, Maggie&#39;s ingenuity, fortitude and passion will set things right, and Brick&#39;s love for his father, never before expressed, will retrieve him from his path of destruction and return him, helplessly, to Maggie&#39;s loving arms.</p><p><p>Tennessee Williams was born in 1911 in Columbus, Mississippi, where his grandfather was the episcopal clergyman.

In many art books, they've been marginalized with cold efficiency, summarily dismissed in the captions of group photographs with the phrase "identity unknown" while each male is named.</p><p> Donna Seaman brings to dazzling life seven of these forgotten artists, among the best of their day: Gertrude Abercrombie, with her dark, surreal paintings and friendships with Dizzy Gillespie and Sonny Rollins; Bay Area self-portraitist Joan Brown; Ree Morton, with her witty, oddly beautiful constructions; Lo�s Mailou Jones of the Harlem Renaissance; Lenore Tawney, who combined weaving and sculpture when art and craft were considered mutually exclusive; Christina Ramberg, whose unsettling works drew on pop culture and advertising; and Louise Nevelson, an art-world superstar in her heyday but omitted from recent surveys of her era. </p><p> These women fought to be treated the same as male artists, to be judged by their work, not their gender or appearance. In brilliant, compassionate prose, Seaman reveals what drove them, how they worked, and how they were perceived by others in a world where women were subjects-not makers-of art. Featuring stunning examples of the artists' work, <i>Identity Unknown </i>speaks to all women about their neglected place in history and the challenges they face to be taken as seriously as men no matter what their chosen field-and to all men interested in women's lives.</p></p><p><b>Donna Seaman </b>is Editor, Adult Books, <i>Booklist</i>, a member of the advisory council for the American Writers Museum, and a recipient of the James Friend Memorial Award for Literary Criticism and the Studs Terkel Humanities Service Award.

Seaman [is] an enchanting biographer" -<i> Washington Post</i></p><p>"Seaman is out to right a grievous wrong but she does so not with shrill arguments but rather with stylish, sensitive and deeply researched prose. "Identity Unknown" is a revelatory, engaging and provocative work." - <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"<i>Identity Unknown</i> goes far beyond the more narrow question of criticism in discussing seven women artists whose relative neglect places them in unfair obscurity.

Seaman&#x2019;s lively portraits make the reader eager to rediscover them, a process helped along by the book&#x2019;s photos of them and their art." -<i> Seattle Times</i></p><p>"[A] diligently researched and compassionately written look into several undsersung female artists . . .

Seaman throws them an elegantly-crafted lifeline, rescuing them from obscurity, in colorful prose that vividly portrays the rich spell of their work, and delves into their lives with empathic curiosity. The result is seven cameos that are poignant and funny, pensive and dramatic, full of calamity and loss at times, as creative lives tend to be, but also love, adventure and the transcendent glory of creating such mesmerizing work. The storied quilt of these unknown lives is absolutely enchanting." - Diane Ackerman, author of THE ZOOKEEPER'S WIFE</p><p>"Identity Unknown is not only a book that illuminates the lives and works of seven artists who have been unjustly neglected, a fate shared by countless brilliant women in many fields, it is a passionate examination of the artistic calling itself. As she moves between a particular artist's personal history and her work, Donna Seaman reveals the stubborn resolve, consuming drive, and fervid concentration necessary for creative labor. In elegant, lucid prose, Seaman makes the unknown known, filling in each blank with a vivid portrait of an exceptional twentieth century artist." - Siri Hustvedt, author of THE BLAZING WORLD</p></p><h2>Deep South (Anna Pigeon Mysteries)</h2><p>When park ranger Anna Pigeon stumbles on the corpse of a girl with a noose around her neck, she is plunged into a murder investigation with serious racial overtones in the heart of the Deep South. By the author of</p><p>After her urban adventures on New York's Ellis Island in <i>Liberty Falling</i>, park ranger Anna Pigeon has finally "heeded the ticking of her bureaucratic clock" and signed on for a promotion in the boonies: district ranger on the Natchez Trace Parkway. Anna's mental images of Mississippi come from black-and-white stock photos from the civil rights movement of the 1960s, so it's not surprising that she finds it beautiful but strange, its residents caught in a teased-hair, fried-food time warp. But she's got more than an unhealthy diet to worry about--as the first female district ranger on the Trace, she immediately encounters more than a few good ol' boys and local miscreants who resent her authority, especially after a 17-year-old beauty is murdered on a booze-soaked prom night near the Trace, her head covered with a KKK-style sheet.<p> There are plenty of reasons her friends and family might have wanted Danielle Posey dead, ranging from her $40,000 insurance policy to jealousy to flat-out insanity. Anna wonders whether the sheet's a red herring, but she can't dismiss it entirely. Though the local culture's no longer built around segregation, racism still exists at a deep level that Anna finds unsettling. Both Danielle Posey and the prime suspect--her boyfriend--are white, but Danielle had secrets her friends won't reveal. Still, no one else appears to be in danger, until a prankster--or could it be a murderer?--sets an alligator loose in Anna's garage (nearly killing her faithful black Lab, Taco) and a local preacher commits suicide. </p><p> With the help of the handsome local sheriff, Paul Davidson, Anna pulls together clues from local history, Civil War reenactors, and the Mississippi mud and kudzu. Anna Pigeon's one tough bird--she survives not only a little alligator wrestling but also a brutal attack that leads her to the truth of what happened to Danielle Posey and why. What's most fascinating is how much of her famous emotional shield she lets slip in the process. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Award-winning Nevada Barr is the author of seven previous Anna Pigeon mysteries, including <i>Liberty Falling</i>. She lives in Mississippi, where she was most recently a ranger on the Natchez Trace Parkway.</p><h2>Cottages by the Sea, The Handmade Homes of Carmel, America&#39;s First Artist Community</h2><p><p>Carmel, California has always been a community of artists, writers, and freethinkers. During the early part of its rich history, the area was home to Robinson Jeffers, Mary Austin, Ansel Adams, Charles Greene, Jack London, George Sterling, Upton Sinclair, and Henry Miller, among other great artists of the twentieth century. During the late 1980s, actor and director Clint Eastwood served as mayor.</p><p>While much about Carmel has changed since the days when Robinson Jeffers could be seen strolling the beach, the area remains one of America's most beautiful.&nbsp; It is also home to many of America's most charming but rarely seen cottages.&nbsp; In Carmel's residential district--a very private, heavily wooded area surrounding the shops and tourist attractions of the town's often busy main street--there are no sidewalks or streetlights.&nbsp; The U.S. Postal Service does not offer mail delivery.&nbsp; Homes have no addresses; they are simply known by name.&nbsp; Here, it is not uncommon for tourists, so intrigued by the uniqueness of the local architecture, to climb the fences of private homes to get a closer look or snapshot of the house on the other side.&nbsp; Now, for the first time, 34 of these homes can be seen more advantageously, in more than 270 specially commissioned and archival exterior and interior photographs.</p></p><p>Linda Leigh Paul is a writer and media relations consultant who specializes in architecture and design.</p><h2>Watercolor Without Boundaries: Exploring Ways to Have Fun With Watercolor</h2><p><p><b>Create stronger and livelier paintings by learning to balance control and spontaneity.</b></p><p>This book presents more than fifty ways to inspire and motivate artists of all levels to play with watercolor and mixed media.

Tour.</p><p><strong>Gaeton Fonzi</strong> was an award-winning investigative journalist, a former senior editor of<em> Philadelphia Magazine</em>, and a consultant to <em>60 Minutes</em>, <em>NBC Nightly News</em>, and <em>Inside Edition</em>. He died in Florida in 2012.A laying of tombstones on 1964's Warren Commission Report and 1979's House Assassinations Committee report; by a former senior editor of Philadelphia magazine. Fonzi early found the Warren Report dependent almost entirely on doctored intelligence from the CIA and biased toward proving Oswald the lone gunman. An autopsy report written by FBI agents who witnessed the autopsy included a third bullet wound, in the shoulder, which the Warren Report ignored: Its inclusion, Fonzi says, would have undermined the Report's lone gunman bias. Elation filled Fonzi in 1975 when he was hired by Senator Richard Schweiker to head the Miami area of the reopened assassination investigation: This time, Congress was looking into the skewing of the Warren Report by US intelligence agencies. Said Schweiker: ``We don't know what happened but we do know Oswald had an intelligence connection. Everywhere you look with him, there are fingerprints of intelligence.'' But the Assassination Committee failed to break through the CIA's shield, Fonzi argues, then ``cover[ed] its ass'' by creating a biased report that diverted light on to the Mob and was the fruit of a ``pseudoinvestigation'' that was compromised at every turn by dark forces that chopped off its financial legs and disallowed resources for a real investigation. According to the author, three important witnesses committed suicide just hours before he was to interview them. Fonzi's own villain is ``Maurice Bishop,'' cover name for the CIA's David Atlee Phillips, who'd been observed with Oswald before the assassination. Fonzi's report turns on the identification of Phillips by Antonio Veciana, an anti- Castro assassin who worked for ``Maurice Bishop.'' Fonzi sticks mostly to personal knowledge, which adds persuasiveness to his theme that Oswald's ties to the CIA may veil the final answer to JFK's murder.

As Jan Morris, who first came to Trieste as the English soldier James Morris in 1945, writes, "It offers no unforgettable landmark, no universally familiar melody, no unmistakable cuisine, hardly a single native name that anyone knows."<p> Yet, as historian and travel writer Morris ably demonstrates in this homage to one of her favorite cities (others about which she has written are Hong Kong, Sydney, New York, and Venice), Trieste has many charms. Its history is foremost among them, thanks to the city's former role as the sole port of the otherwise landlocked Austro-Hungarian empire, which housed a small fleet there--a fleet that, from time to time, would sail off to make war against the Ottomans or the Italians. At the beginning of the 20th century, Trieste had grown to international importance as an entry point into Central Europe, so much so that it was referred to as "the third entrance of the Suez Canal." Trieste briefly took center stage at the onset of the cold war, when Marshall Tito claimed it for Yugoslavia; it narrowly avoided being enveloped by the Iron Curtain. Morris tells all these stories and more, bringing the city's past to life; no one should be surprised if Trieste sees more visitors thanks to her spirited study.</p><p> Yet <i>Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere</i> is also a work tinged with melancholy. That befits the city's faded glory, but it also has to do with the sad fact that this will be Morris's last book--or so she promises. Let's hope she changes her mind. If not, however, this serves very well as the capstone of a distinguished career. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Jan Morris</b> has written more than thirty books on the British Empire, Europe, Venice, Oxford, Sydney, Hong Kong, Man-hattan and Wales, as well as six volumes of collected essays and two autobiographical works.

Since retiring, he has conducted numerous weekend workshops showing people how to build wood-fired ovens. And now, Watt has written this book - a treasure trove of guidance, based on years of practical and personal experience - to show how to build the &#34;must have&#34; accessory for the backyard chef. Illustrated with many excellent photographs and line drawings, the book explains the historical development of ovens, along with the physics and basic principles of oven design. It contains sections on oven bases and different types of ovens, ranging from low tech to high tech, as well as the traditional brick dome oven. The book also includes discussions on chimneys and dampers, casting a chimney, and doors and doorways. The appendixes illustrate how to cast an arch, forming a brick arch without traditional formwork, and casting a chimney base. Some wonderful recipes are also included.</p><p></p><h2>The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions</h2><p>Jesus is reported to have asked his disciples, "Who do you say that I am?" The question of who Jesus really was has been reignited in our own time, as scholars, clergy, and laypeople debate the truth about Jesus. The answer determines what true Christian faith and authentic Christian living are today.<p>Now, two leading scholars, representing the primary alternative views, freshly capture the historical Jesus debate in one spirited volume. Marcus Borg, the most popular liberal voice on Jesus, a member of the Jesus Seminar, and author of the bestselling <em>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time,</em> and N. T. Wright, the most prominent standard-bearer for the traditional stance, outspoken critic of the Jesus Seminar, and author of <em>Jesus and the Victory of God,</em> collaborate for the first time in a civilized but forthright debate about all the essential issues.</p><p>In alternating chapters, Borg and Wright present their significantly different visions of who Jesus was, what he taught, and what he did. Although both authors share a conviction that Christian faith should be grounded in the best historical scholarship and they agree that Jesus is the Christian messiah and preached the Kingdom of God, they express sharp, well-argued disagreement over many crucial issues. Did Jesus know that he was the messiah? Did Jesus intentionally die to redeem humankind? Was Jesus bodily resurrected from the dead? Was Jesus God? Was Jesus born of a virgin?</p><p>The authors show how we can come to know Jesus historically and how our faith is vitally shaped by that understanding. Marcus Borg, a practicing Episcopalian, and N. T. Wright, a prominent Anglican clergyman-both of whom obtained their doctorates in New Testament at Oxford University, working with the same principal professor-express their views with remarkable clarity and personal conviction. And their lively, substantial, yet respectful dialogue provides a wonderful foundation and model for how the historical Jesus debate needs to be conducted.</p><p>Through their engaging exchange Borg and Wright begin to answer the essential question of "how different visions of Jesus relate to visions of the Christian life," and they spell out what it means to each of them to be a Christian at the end of the twentieth century. </p><p> The Historical Jesus Debate in one volume</p><p>For the first time, leading figures in the field collaborate to debate the essential issues in the historical Jesus controversy. <em>The Meaning of Jesus</em> offers the major alternate visions of Jesus and explores the differences the understanding of Jesus makes in shaping faith today. The authors show how what one thinks of Jesus determines what it means to be a Christian. They debate all the crucial issues, including:</p><p></p><ul><li>The Divinity of Jesus<p></p></li><li>The Virgin Birth<p></p></li><li>The Meaning of the Crucifixion<p></p></li><li>The Truth of the Resurrection<p></p></li><li>The Second Coming</li></ul></p><p><i>The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions</i> is a theological remix of the old Cole Porter song "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." In alternating chapters, the (mostly) liberal Marcus J. Borg and the (mostly) conservative N.T. Wright consider the major questions of the historical-Jesus debate that has dominated biblical studies in the 1990s. Borg and Wright agree that Jesus was the Christian messiah and preached the Kingdom of God, but they disagree about the Virgin birth, the purpose of Jesus' death, the issue of his bodily resurrection, and the question of his divinity. The Ping-Pong structure of this book and the fastidious politeness with which the authors treat one another sometimes give <i>The Meaning of Jesus</i> a tomato/tomahto, potato/potahto bounciness, but the project is nevertheless worthy: this is a simple, clear orientation to some of the most important biblical questions of our time, and a record of a lively and loving friendship between two of the best Christian scholars alive. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Marcus J. Borg (1942&#x2013;2015) was a pioneering author and teacher whom the <em>New York Times</em> described as "a leading figure in his generation of Jesus scholars."

Remembered largely for his cry for liberty or death,&#x201d; Henry was actually the first (and most colorful) of America's Founding Fathers first to call Americans to arms against Britain, first to demand a bill of rights, and first to fight the growth of big government after the Revolution.<p> As quick with a rifle as he was with his tongue, Henry was America's greatest orator and courtroom lawyer, who mixed histrionics and hilarity to provoke tears or laughter from judges and jurors alike. Henry's passion for liberty (as well as his very large family), suggested to many Americans that he, not Washington, was the real father of his country.</p><p> This biography is history at its best, telling a story both human and philosophical. As Unger points out, Henry's words continue to echo across America and inspire millions to fight government intrusion in their daily lives.</p></p><p>A veteran journalist, broadcaster, educator, and historian, <b>Harlow Giles Unger</b> is a former Distinguished Visiting Fellow in American History at Mount Vernon and is the author of sixteen books, including five other biographies of America's Founding Fathers. He lives in New York.Unger depicts the fierce revolutionary who cried out for liberty or death and provides a clear presentation of his political ideas, including his belief that the Constitution would soon result in federal tyranny--which Unger believes has taken place. William Hughes&#39;s slightly husky voice is pleasant enough, and he narrates with a light-handed energy, keeping up a good pace without rushing the listener. He modulates his tone and expression to fit the occasionally complex text with an easy naturalness. His reading gives an impression of amiability and intelligence, marred only by occasional mispronunciation or misplaced emphasis. Overall, Hughes&#39;s narration enhances the text while leaving it, not the performance, the focus of attention.

They think being light-skinned is better than being dark! Mama says that's nonsense and I think so, too."<p> Nellie Lee Love is an 11-year-old African American girl living in the rural South at the end of World War I. In a year of tumultuous change, victory, and tragedy, she records her thoughts and feelings in a diary given her by her mother. After the white racism in their town becomes too brutally overt to ignore, Nellie and her family pack up and move to Chicago. Delighted with the seemingly endless opportunities in the big city, Nellie is blindsided by the more insidious forms of prejudice that northerners practice: hatred within their own race. But through family unity and integrity, and education by way of W.E.B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey's writings, Nellie and her family gradually discover a place for themselves in their new circumstances, and ultimately find hope and triumph.</p><p> Newbery Honor and Coretta Scott King Award winner Patricia McKissack writes the kind of historical fiction that will have history students and even reluctant readers and clamoring for more. The dignity and courage of the Love family provides a model for all families, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.

Not much happens; about the only excitement is the occasional letter from Nellie&#x2019;s Uncle Pace, still a soldier in France.

Then one day, the town&#x2019;s sheriff confiscates the shop&#x2019;s copies of The Crisis, and warns the men there that anyone belonging to the NAACP is asking for trouble from the Ku Klux Klan. A wire comes announcing that Uncle Pace is coming home. But when he does, he&#x2019;s been badly injured. As the sheriff tells it, he got drunk and fell asleep on the railroad tracks, where he was hit by a train. Everyone knows that Pace did not drink at all. He dies, and Daddy, realizing that this suspicious death has probably been the work of the Klan, decides to protect his family by moving them to Chicago. Here he hopes to set up a new undertaking business. Life in the city is far different for the Love girls from what they thought it would be. They must adapt to crowded apartment living, new neighbors, a tough new school, and making new friends, none of which is easy. But these discomforts are nothing to compare with the race riot that occurs that summer. The Loves get through it unscathed, but with the realization that they did not leave the problems of racism behind when they left Tennessee. It is this knowledge that gives Nellie and the rest of the Loves the impetus to become actively involved in the fight against prejudice and to begin the long march to full equality as Americans. It&#x2019;s an inspiring story, and one that brings to life the great black migration of that era from the south to the cities of the north. This part of American history is too often glossed over in textbooks, but must be understood in the context of modern race relations. (Fiction. 11-14) -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

SERIES EDITED BY CYNTHIA BRANTLEY JOHNSON</p></p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesThe first and most successful in the Baroness&#39;s series of books that feature Percy Blakeney, who leads a double life as an English fop and a swashbuckling rescuer of aristocrats, &#34;The Scarlet Pimpernel was the blueprint for what became known as the masked-avenger genre. As Anne Perry writes in her Introduction, the novel &#34;has almost reached its first centenary, and it is as vivid and appealing as ever because the plotting is perfect. It is a classic example of how to construct, pace, and conclude a plot. . . . To rise on the crest of laughter without capsizing, to survive being written, rewritten, and reinterpreted by each generation, is the mark of a plot that is timeless and universal, even though it happens to be set in England and France of 1792.&#34;</p><h2>The Auschwitz Album: A Book Based Upon an Album Discovered by a Concentration Camp Survivor, Lili Meier</h2><p>Because of its content as well as its history, the publication of this book is an extraordinary event: in April 1944 a young woman named Lili Jacob (now Lili Jacob Meier) was deported with her family from Bilke, a small town in the Carpathian Mountains, to Hungary. With the other Jews of Bilke, the Jacobs were sent by the Nazis first to a ghetto in the nearby town of Berehovo and, a short time later, to Auschwitz and its death camp, Birkenau. Everyone in Lili&#39;s family was slaughtered. One she survived, after being subjected to bestial treatment. Eventually Lili was sent to Dora, a Nazi slave camp four hundred miles to the west, and it was there that she and other inmates of the prison were liberated by the Americans. On that day, gravely ill, Lili fell asleep in a newly vacated German barracks. When she awakened, she searched for warm clothing and found, under a pajama top, a photograph album. She opened it and, on the very first page, saw the picture of Naftali Svi Weiss, the distinguished rabbi of Bilke. Turning the pages, LIli found, in the neatly positioned photographs, the images of the doomed Jews of Auschwitz--among them members of her own family. Now, years later, these photographs, most of which have never been published before, are made available to the general public in what is one of the century&#39;s most powerful and unique historical records. Harrowing, eerie, immensely poignant, these pictures of the German death factory and of the pained and bewildered faces of people &#34;selected&#34; for either slave labor or the gas chamber form what has been called &#34;a holy document&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Latina Christiana 1, Student Book (4th Edition 2015) (Latin Edition)</h2><p><i>Latina Christiana</i> is a beginning course for students of all ages.

In this novel, Block brings back Matt Scudder, one of his great characters. Scudder has been sober for quite a few years, and now he is presented with a murder mystery within his circle of New York Alcoholics Anonymous members. The dialogue in this book is so concise and perfect in tone that the reader will wish he could follow Scudder around and overhear more of it. Block is one of the most respected mystery writers in America, and this new book, which was published in May, is a lesson in how to write. </p> <p> 2) Joe Gores, <i>Spade and Archer</i>. This is the final book of a fine writer who won three Edgar Awards and wrote numerous excellent books. He was also an expert on Dashiell Hammett, and in this is a prequel to <i>The Maltese Falcon</i> he writes in Hammett's style. </p> <p> 3) Josh Bazell, <i>Beat the Reaper</i>. Published in 2009, this first novel was written by a brilliant young man whose day job is being a doctor. It's original, witty, and maybe just a little bit crazy at times--the perfect book for summer. I believe we'll be reading Bazell's books for a long time, so it's time to begin. </p> <p> 4) Deon Meyer, <i>Thirteen Hours</i>. Meyer, who is South African, is gradually being noticed by other writers as a major talent. <i>Thirteen Hours</i> is one of the most suspenseful books I've ever read, and is a good introduction to his work. </p> <p> 5) John Sandford, <i>Storm Prey</i>. I chose this book, which came out in 2010, because it's recent, because it includes both Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flowers, and because I haven't yet read the book that came out in May, <i>Buried Prey</i>. But you can choose from any of his 40 others, and it will be well worth your time. </p> <p> </p>The Butcher&#x2019;s Boy is back. Thomas Perry&#x2019;s vengeful assassin, who turned on his Mafia clients and helped his author win an Edgar Award in 1983, has been quiet for a decade.

Now, in the eagerly awaited follow-up, Dr. Parent provides readers with a new approach to the aspect of golf in which mental skills have the most impact: putting. </p><p> <i>Zen Putting</i> takes a thinking-outside-the-box approach based on the idea that by tuning into the process of putting rather than worrying about the <i>result</i>, golfers can get out of their own way and maximize performance.

In succinct, informative chapters, Dr. Parent applies this Zen ideal to a variety of subjects for any putting situation. <br><br> Chapters include:<br> � &#x201c;Unconquerable Confidence&#x201d;: brimming with strategies to cultivate confidence and turn frustration into enjoyment.<br> � &#x201c;Get Out of Your Own Way&#x201d;: exploring the obstacles we create for ourselves in putting, and how to recognize and overcome them to get the most out of our abilities.<br> � &#x201c;How to Make Every Putt&#x201d;: on reading greens; visualization; putting routine; the key components of a putt&#x2014;path, pace, and roll; and taking the ideal attitude before putting. <br><br> Unlike rigid how-to books on putting or fad coaching techniques, <i>Zen Putting</i> stirs each reader to cultivate their own unique style for synchronizing body and mind to achieve peak performance.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p><b>Dr. Joe Parent</b> has coached the mental game in golf, business, and life for over twenty- five years.

He was born in Harlem to immigrant parents from Jamaica. He knew the rough life of the streets. He overcame a barely average start at school. Then he joined the Army. The rest is history - but a history that until now has been known only on the surface. Here, for the first time, he himself tells us how it happened, in a memoir distinguished by a heartfelt love of country and family, warm good humor, and a soldier&#39;s directness. He writes of the anxieties and missteps as well as the triumphs that marked his rise to four-star general, National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, mastermind of Desert Storm, and now the man the country would most like to draft as President just as it drafted General Eisenhower before him in 1952. We see Powell growing up, getting into mischief, going to church with his father, working in a bottling plant, joining the ROTC. We follow him as a green young lieutenant on his first foreign posting in Germany, where his ascent is nearly aborted by a blunder on the day he is assigned to guard an atomic cannon. We go on patrol with him into the jungles of Vietnam, where he is wounded, and then, in the first surprise turn of his career, into the every-bit-as-dangerous thickets of Washington bureaucracy as a Pentagon aide in the Carter administration. We see how he handled the humiliations inflicted on him as a black soldier traveling in the Deep South and the unnerving challenges he faced as a battalion commander in Korea, where the army guarding the border with North Korea was plagued by drugs, drinking, a lack of discipline, and racial tension. We are edge-of-the-seat spectators to some of the great international dramas of our time - Desert Storm, the invasion of Panama, the dark dealings of Iran-contra with Ollie North and Bill Casey, the climactic meetings with Gorbachev.

Jon Bonn� writes from the front lines of the California wine revolution, where he has access to the stories, philosophies, and techniques of top producers.<br><br> In this groundbreaking debut, Bonn� paints an unflinching portrait of the current state of the industry: its strengths and shortcomings, its essential wines and those not worth pursuing. Lush full-color photographs, as well as a region-by-region tour of some of California&#x2019;s lesser-known growing areas, reveal the people and places behind the bottles. Finally, a comprehensive purchasing reference lists all the must-know producers and their best wines, making <i>The New California Wine</i> an essential resource for finding and buying the very best the state has to offer.</p><p>&nbsp;JON BONN� is the wine editor of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, responsible for the newspaper&#x2019;s coverage of wine and spirits, as well as the annual &#x201c;Top 100 Wines&#x201d; list.

I wasn&#x2019;t in the mood.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#x201c;If I hated California wine,&#x201d; I replied, &#x201c;would I be doing what I do?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew, when I moved to California in 2006, that I was facing long odds. I had come to a place that believed, above all, in the superiority of its wines. Anyone who didn&#x2019;t embrace that belief was viewed as a threat. And in the past I had dared to voice my dissatisfaction with a California wine culture that I saw as often self-satisfied and underwhelming. Worse, I was from the East Coast, an outsider. My years spent in New York, where I learned from my father about European wines from Vouvray to Valpolicella, were a liability instead of an asset.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Six years earlier I had moved to Seattle, and while there I came to love West Coast wines&#x2014;in particular the pioneering wines of Washington State. I began my wine-writing career there. Clearly, I was no foe of American winemaking. But none of that mattered the moment I landed at the Oakland airport.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had come to the Bay Area to run the wine section of the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, six to ten pages of some of the country&#x2019;s most influential wine journalism. The California wine industry was not pleased: their work was about to be judged by someone whose palate was honed not on hefty Cabernet and Zinfandel but on nuanced Old World wines.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I approached my work earnestly. But from the moment I arrived, I had to confront my own deep skepticism about California&#x2019;s winemaking reality. Again and again I was disappointed by what I found to be the shortfalls of California wine: a ubiquity of oaky, uninspired bottles and a presumption that bigger was indeed better.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The truth was, I had come to California to be convinced. I was looking for signs that skeptics like me were wrong, and that what had long been a near-magical land for wine could still achieve greatness.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever I might have thought about California wines at that point, I had started from a place of love. In February 1985, when I was twelve, my father took our family to California. At the time I was far more interested in the Apple factory tour in Cupertino, but Dad had always brought us up around wine. He gave me my first glass at age five, and soon enough I was having a bit with dinner most nights. When he took us to Napa Valley, it was clear we were somewhere special. We visited the Robert Mondavi Winery, with its campanile and familiar arch, the brick-and-mortar icon from the labels I had often seen around the house. Even then I knew we had arrived at the cradle of American wine. California wines at the time were vibrant, the industry invigorated by its speedy rise to rival Europe in quality.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why, then, had California wine fallen into such a stupor years later? That was the question I set out to answer. I wanted to reconcile these two&nbsp; Californias&#x2014;the one I remembered that was so full of promise and life, and the one that was stuck in a self-satisfied funk.<br> &nbsp;<br>My first couple of years in California were tough. I hunted desperately for local wines worth praising while I featured lots of imports in the newspaper&#x2019;s wine section, arguing that the Bay Area in fact had a critical mass of great importers (like Berkeley&#x2019;s Kermit Lynch). This argument did not sit well among partisans of California&#x2019;s wines, but I couldn&#x2019;t overlook the sad fact that Napa had become a bombastic shell of its earlier, humbler self. Its top names&#x2014;Beaulieu and Beringer and even Mondavi&#x2014;had grown into big corporate entities, while its smaller labels were locked in an arms race, each trying to create bigger, riper, and more outrageous wines.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still, I had come prepared with good leads. Just two weeks into the job I had to choose our winemaker of the year, and quickly enough I selected Paul Draper of Ridge Vineyards. Draper&#x2019;s work was beyond reproach: for nearly forty years he had been at the helm at Ridge, where he made not only the state&#x2019;s benchmark Zinfandel-focused wines, Geyserville and Lytton Springs, but also one of the finest Cabernet-based wines in the world, Monte Bello.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My choice of Draper came with a subtler message. In the midst of an industry that had blindly embraced technology and by-the-numbers winemaking, he was an outspoken traditionalist. He rejected commercial yeasts and fancy flavor-enhancing techniques and was a vocal critic of the science-minded efforts of the University of California at Davis, one of the top winemaking schools in the world.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than that, he believed that the making of wine was sacrosanct, a true expression of the land. Wine &#x201c;was traditionally the central symbol for transformation, because the grape transforms itself simply by being broken by man, because it transforms itself with nothing else,&#x201d; he told me at the time.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By choosing Draper, I had set a theme for my work. I quietly kept searching for wines that I felt reflected what I knew California could offer. The following year, my winemaker of the year was Josh Jensen of Calera. Known as Mr. Limestone, Jensen in the 1970s had pioneered the quest for great Pinot Noir grown on calcareous soils that approximated those of Burgundy&#x2014;and paid a critical price over the years for stubbornly refusing to give in to the whims of fashion.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly, I encountered other winemakers with similar beliefs. I found people who remained committed to restrained, compelling wines that spoke clearly of their origins&#x2014;and who shared my frustration with California&#x2019;s modern style.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some, like Draper and Jensen, had been toiling for decades; others were upstarts with the same energy and ambition as the pioneers from previous generations. Eventually, the brushstrokes began to turn into something recognizable: the seeds of a new movement, a new California wine in the making.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was more than just a blip. Wines from emerging producers like Lioco, Broc Cellars, and Matthiasson, which just a few years earlier would have been decidedly fringe for California, had by 2010 amassed a loyal audience. They were being sought out by the disillusioned fans of an earlier California generation who believed that modern winemaking had forsaken them. They also attracted sommeliers and wine buyers who had previously all but written off California as well as those who had shunned domestic wine in favor of imported until finally finding bottles that spoke their aesthetic language. That year, I wrote a piece for <i>Saveur</i> magazine making a case for the New California wine&#x2014;and by that time, talk of a grand revival no longer seemed unrealistic. <br> &nbsp;<br> New California&#x2019;s winemakers share similar sensibilities: an enthusiasm for lessons learned from the Old World, but not the desire to replicate its wines; a mandate to seek out new grape varieties and regions; and, perhaps most important, an ardent the belief that place matters. They are true believers in terroir. This is crucial because California&#x2019;s future ultimately depends upon wines that show nuance, restraint, and a deep evocation of place. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But California is also somewhat obsessed with size. Although there are hundreds of small family wineries throughout the state, the industry is dominated by its Big Three: Gallo, Constellation Wines, and the Wine Group. In 2011, according to industry investor David Freed, the Big Three were responsible for more than 64 percent of the state&#x2019;s wine shipments; they made two of every three bottles of California wine. If you don&#x2019;t recognize their names (though certainly Gallo is ubiquitous), you know their brands. Gallo&#x2019;s empire covers everything from Barefoot to Louis Martini to Apothic and Turning Leaf. After a blitzkrieg buying spree over the past decade, Constellation now owns Robert Mondavi, Ravenswood, Clos du Bois, and nearly two dozen other labels. And the Wine Group controls much of the rest of the supermarket shelves, including brands like Franzia, Cupcake, Glen Ellen, and Concannon.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That doesn&#x2019;t even factor in the massive influence of Fred Franzia&#x2019;s Bronco Wine Company, maker of twenty million cases worth of Charles Shaw wines (better known as Two Buck Chuck) and dozens of other labels. It is estimated that Bronco and the four next largest labels&#x2014;Trinchero (Sutter Home, M�nage � Trois), Kendall-Jackson, Delicato (Gnarly Head, Irony), and Treasury Wine Estates (a former division of Australian brewer Foster&#x2019;s that encompasses Beringer, Meridian, and more)&#x2014;account for another 20 percent of the California wine industry. In other words, sea change in the overall market&nbsp; for California wine only happens when the Fred Franzias of the world get involved.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet California&#x2019;s state of the art has typically been judged on an elite roster of producers. When the state&#x2019;s wine style shifted in the 1990s, it happened not among makers of table wine but among a small set of mostly Cabernet specialists.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That&#x2019;s why, when I sought signs of change in California winemaking, I knew I needed to hunt among the little guys. Change always comes first at a small scale&#x2014;in part because, as vineyard owner David Hirsch might put it, you have to apply yourself to a specific place in order to begin to understand the thousand tiny things that allow you to make great wine.<br> &nbsp;<br> The winemakers you&#x2019;ll find in the following pages aren&#x2019;t meant to represent all of the state&#x2019;s ambitions. Rather, they are pioneers, setting the agenda for the New California wine.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not every young winery appears. Some are too wedded to the aesthetics of the previous generation; others may be too new. In this book you&#x2019;ll also find some older wineries like Calera and Ridge, with reputations that stretch back for decades. They appear here because they have stayed the course through darker times.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The book is divided into three sections. The first part, &#x201c;Searching for the New California,&#x201d; aims to take you along on my journey to discover the many changes taking place and meet the people behind them. The second part, &#x201c;The New Terroir,&#x201d; is a road trip through some of the regions that are helping to redefine California winemaking. The third, &#x201c;Wines of the New California,&#x201d; lays out essential producers and their wines and discusses the changes in winemaking and wine styles in recent years.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each section addresses an aspect of what I&#x2019;ve come to believe: this is the best time in a generation to drink California wine. More than that, today marks the arrival of a mature American wine culture, where producers are confident enough not to mimic the Old World or obscure the nuances of terroir with clever cellar work, but rather seek greatness in a uniquely American context.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is the wonderful reality of the New California.<br></p><h2>101 Dalmatians</h2><p><b>The book that inspired the animated movie classic!</b><br><br>When Dearly's Dalmatians have their first litter of pups&#x2014;fifteen in all&#x2014;everyone is delighted.

However, this renewed apologetic interest in textual criticism has created fresh problems for evangelicals. An unfortunate proliferation of myths, mistakes, and misinformation has arisen about this technical area of biblical studies. In this volume Elijah Hixson and Peter Gurry, along with a team of New Testament textual critics, offer up-to-date, accurate information on the history and current state of the New Testament text that will serve apologists and Christian students even as it offers a self-corrective to evangelical excesses.</p><p>Elijah Hixson (PhD, University of Edinburgh) is junior research associate in New Testament Text and Language at Tyndale House, Cambridge, and author of <i>Scribal Habits in Sixth-Century Greek Purple Codices</i>.&nbsp;Peter Gurry (PhD, University of Cambridge) is Assistant Professor of New Testament and Co-Director of the Text &amp; Canon Institute at Phoenix Seminary."The authors in this book offer a necessary corrective to decades of overly exuberant apologetic arguments&#x2015;arguments that have actually hurt the Christian faith. The writers are refreshingly honest, and they do not pull their punches. They observe poignantly that apologetic works on the reliability of the New Testament text have been drifting away from a proper, well-researched, accurately documented scholarship that is anchored to actual data. Apologists have had a tendency to regurgitate other apologetic works, which in turn are based on other apologetic works. Meanwhile, the scholarship that is supposedly behind the popular declarations in many an evangelical trade book is out-of-date, misunderstood, or simply ignored. <br><br>These young scholars have something to say&#x2015;not only to Christian speakers and writers but to non-Christian speakers and writers and even to New Testament scholars of all stripes. I was happily stunned to see the depth of discussion, the candid examination, and the up-to-date bibliography in each chapter. Although <em>Myths and Mistakes in New Testament Textual Criticism</em> is written in clear, user-friendly prose, the contents are well-grounded and perspicacious. I intend to utilize this volume unapologetically in my introduction as a primary source for several analyses." (From the foreword by Daniel B. Wallace, Dallas Theological Seminary and Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts)<br><br>"Sanity, balance, and sober judgment are all qualities that too frequently are lacking in recent discourse. Even what some might consider to be the arcane discipline of New Testament textual criticism has not been immune from false facts and fake news. It is against this backdrop that this volume makes an invaluable contribution. Combining care, caution, and rigorous scholarship, the contributors place before readers the latest research and an accurate account of the state of the text of the New Testament. For those seeking to be reliably informed there will be no better guide than this book to understand the origins, manuscripts, transmission, collection, and translations of the writings that form the New Testament. This book replaces ignorance with knowledge, foolishness with wisdom, and angry argument with irenic debate. Anybody who cares about the text of the New Testament must read this book." (Paul Foster, professor of New Testament and Christian origins, School of Divinity, University of Edinburgh)<br><br>"I personally don't think that you can defend the truth and accuracy of Scripture as the Word of God with untruths and inaccuracies. So I welcome this book that contains an enormous amount of useful information on the text of the New Testament in a form aimed to help people involved in apologetics. Occasionally there is some tough love when mistakes and problems are highlighted, but the aim is always to improve the reader's understanding of the New Testament and thus their witness to the person of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Scriptures that tell his story." (Peter M. Head, Wycliffe Hall, University of Oxford)<br><br>"Early in my work as an apologist, I made an embarrassing number of mistakes when it came to comments about textual criticism. In almost every instance, a book like this one would have provided the broader perspective that I needed to speak the truth with greater precision. What Elijah Hixson and Peter Gurry have provided in this handbook is a tool that every would-be defender of the Christian faith should purchase and regularly consult. Sloppy defenses of the truth always end up diminishing the truth instead of exalting the truth. <em>Myths and Mistakes in New Testament Textual Criticism</em> will equip you to leave behind sloppy defenses of Scripture when it comes to textual criticism." (Timothy Paul Jones, C. Edwin Gheens Endowed Chair of Christian Ministry, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Packed with reliable data, Christian-friendly apologetics, but also critical of exaggerations and inaccuracies of some apologists, this rich multiauthor volume is a valuable resource. Practically every aspect of New Testament textual criticism is addressed competently and clearly. Highly recommended!" (L. W. Hurtado, emeritus professor of New Testament language, literature, and theology, University of Edinburgh)<br><br>"I am delighted that these rising stars in the field of New Testament textual criticism have undertaken to guide the church to more integrity and accuracy in the way we talk about the Bible, especially to outsiders. Students, pastors, and lay leaders will find a great foundation for proper handling of Scripture as well as trustworthy resources for apologetics. The essays are in-depth enough to inform the expert but written in plain language with helpful conclusions and takeaways, so the main points are accessible to any committed reader." (Amy S. Anderson, professor of Greek and New Testament at North Central University, Minneapolis)<br><br>"Informative, fair-minded, and sober.

Assigned for nearly a decade to a clandestine U.S. Army intelligence group, Buchanan trained military personnel who utilized their inherent psychic abilities as a data-collection tool during the Iran hostage crisis, the Chernobyl disaster, and the Gulf War. <br> In this incredible account, Buchanan tells how he was selected for his unique psychic abilities, and how he was transformed from an ordinary soldier into one of our nation's leading psychic spies. Working on top-secret government and military projects using "mental espionage" created permanent, life-altering changes within Buchanan. Now, after many years of analysis and interpretation, he reveals the techniques and mental exercises used to train remote viewers, and demonstrates that each of us carries a dormant psychic ability that we can explore and use ourselves. <br> For anyone interested in a hard, scientific look at the reality of psychic covert operations in the world today, or anyone who has ever wondered if he or she could have the inherent skills to become a remote viewer, this fascinating chronicle of life as a psychic spy will reveal the answers.</p><p>Leonard "Lyn" Buchanan is now retired from US Army intelligence. He has used remote viewing to assist police and federal agents in locating missing children, and founded Problems&gt;Solutions&gt;Innovations, a company that helps corporations develop solutions for intelligence-related data acquisition. Considered to be one of the best Remote Viewing trainers, he lives in Alamogordo, New Mexico, with his wife, Linda.

No one had told me where it was. In spite of a very shallow and clandestine briefing at a Czech restaurant in Germany, I wasn't really sure of what the unit did, or for that matter what I would be doing in it. To top that off, I had been given two different sets of orders: one "official" set, printed on paper, and a totally different set, given verbally. The official orders said that I was to report to HHQ Co, 902 MIBn, INSCOM, Ft. Meade. Translated into human speech, that stands for Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Company, 902nd Military Intelligence Battalion, Intelligence and Security Command, located at Fort Meade, Maryland.<br><br>But the verbal orders I had received said that I should not go anywhere near the 902nd. Upon reaching Fort Meade, Maryland, I was to check in at the military guest quarters and call a certain phone number to let a special agent know that I had arrived. Under no circumstances was I to report in to the 902nd, as my written orders stated. In effect, I had been instructed to go AWOL the first day of my new assignment.<br><br>My wife, Linda, my seven-year-old son, Lael, and I arrived at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport late in the evening of April 1, 1984. It is customary for a soldier and his family to call the unit to which he is reporting and have a staff driver pick them up. I couldn't do that, due to the verbal orders. We took a cab from the airport to the Fort Meade Guest House. The desk clerk asked for my orders and said that he would call the unit and let them know I was in. He was somewhat perplexed when I asked him not to.<br><br>In the room, I pulled out the napkin which had been given to me in the Czech restaurant in Germany. The hand-scrawled phone number on it was for a private residence in the Fort Meade area. A man's voice answered, and said that we should all wait in the parking lot in front of the guest house. He would come right by.<br><br>When we arrived in the parking lot, a dense, misty fog had rolled in, making the whole scene look like something out of a Hollywood spy movie. The guest house is far removed from the other base facilities, so the darkness was oppressive. All we could see through the swirling fog was the fuzzy, eerie glow of the guest house's neon sign at the edge of the parking lot. We stood quietly, feeling small drops of mist sweeping against our faces in the moist night breeze. With the fog, the world had gone deathly quiet, and nothing could be heard except our own breathing and the electric crackle of the neon sign's transformer. Even Lael, an active and impatient seven-year-old still on German time, was subdued by the surrounding mystery.<br><br>I looked at my wife and marveled at the courage of this woman who would accompany me anywhere in the world, on nothing more than faith that I would do the right thing. I wondered how she could keep that faith even at times like this, when she knew that I had absolutely no idea of what I was getting us into. She looked back at me and gave the slightest of smiles. The silent mist swirled and we shifted from one foot to the other and waited.<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>The events leading up to my new assignment at Fort Meade were, quite frankly, odd. I had been working at the U.S. Army Field Station in Augsburg, Germany, for a little over two years. I had originally been assigned there as a Russian linguist, but through some devious manipulation, had worked my way into the Computer Operations and Coordination section.<br><br>At that time, the coordination of the computers at the field station was a large task, since we had almost a hundred different computer systems with several different countries of origin. The computer systems did not "talk" to each other, and there was constant conflict among the data fields, the computers, and the people and countries who ran them.<br><br>I had been there almost a year when I received the order to design a program that would tie the field station's many computer systems together into a single reporting entity. Another sergeant -- I'll call him Doug -- felt that he should have gotten the job and was very hostile toward me for the selection. During the following two months, Doug repeatedly got into my programming code and placed "bombs" there, as his means of revenge. I confronted him several times, but it only fanned the flames. In frustration and as a total last resort, I reported him to his superiors, who threatened him with disciplinary action if he did it again. There were no more interruptions from Doug and in another month I had the program running and tested.<br><br>Now I had to make the necessary demonstration briefing to the commanders of the various U.S. military branches and the military commanders of more than a dozen different NATO countries that had personnel at the field station. When the day came to make the demonstration, I arrived early, checked and rechecked the program for errors or flaws. There was none. I ran it through all the testing procedures and made certain the presentation would go smoothly. Everything checked out perfectly. Right before presentation time, I went to the bathroom to make certain my hair was well combed and there were no scuffs on my spit-shined shoes or wrinkles in my uniform. At the appointed time, the commanding officers of every military unit attached to the field station began to assemble for the briefing on the new computer program.<br><br>I went through the initial song and dance about the need for such a program, what problems it would solve, what benefits would be reaped, and so on. I then turned and hit the computer's enter key to begin the demonstration. The computer screen went blank. Something had gone wrong. I turned back to the chuckling audience and searched for something to say when I saw Doug standing in the doorway. He grinned menacingly and pointed a finger at me. "Gotcha!" he mouthed, and turned to leave.<br><br>Something welled up in me then, which had not happened in years: an uncontrollable rage. Earlier in life, I had been one of those "poltergeist" children. I had learned in my early teens that when I allow myself to get truly angry, things around me go crazy. As Doug turned to leave, things did exactly that.<br><br>When I was about twelve years old, odd things began to happen in the form of objects around me moving or bumping, or suddenly falling for no apparent reason. It was bothersome to others, but to me, it was odd and interesting. It felt as if it was something I was doing so I began trying to learn what it could be. I learned that I could sometimes cause a few small things to happen -- simple things -- at will. They were not enough to really impress anyone, but they were enough to spur me onward. I devised some mental exercises to help me "flex my mind muscles." I developed a "little voice" that would give the orders and help keep things organized. I understood completely that it was just a device of my own making, and not a real voice. It was not an entity of any kind, a spirit, or even an alter ego. I was not really hearing things. It was just a gimmick I had devised to separate my regular thoughts from those that were supposed to make the weird things happen. I was never afraid of it, and actually thought of it as a really neat plaything. I had complete control over it.<br><br>Through this and some other exercises that I devised, I learned to make bigger things happen, and could make the smaller things happen with little effort. But as I got better at it, the things that happened "by themselves" got stronger, too. I practiced and learned more control, so these spurious incidents became less frequent, but when they did happen, they were much more noticeable. A couple of times, the little voice had done something by itself to get me out of a fight or embarrassment, but for the most part, the unbidden incidents were just funny little things. In fact, they were usually harmless pranks, at the most. They happened without my volition, and I would often see the humor in them and appreciate the unexpected cleverness behind them.<br><br>Around age fourteen, though, with hormones rising, I began competing for the attention of young girls. One day I was showing off, trying to impress the cute redheaded girl who attracted me so. I succeeded by showing her one of the tricks I had learned to do with the little voice inside my head. It did impress her, all right. In fact, she was so impressed that she went home and told her father -- the Pentecostal minister. The following day, he and two of his deacons met me after school and asked for a demonstration. As soon as this demonstration succeeded, they all slammed their hands onto my head and pushed me down to the sidewalk, screaming to God to cast the Devil out of me.<br><br>I was brought up in "Deep East Texas," otherwise known as the Bible Belt. There, if the preacher said something, then God must have said it, too. They had suddenly and forcefully turned my little trick into a sin against God. They were trying to rid me of an evil which had not been there before they tried. I was scared to death and so shaken from the incident that I had nightmares for a month.<br><br>What had been nothing more than an amusing and interesting plaything now had its roots in ominous evil. It still didn't feel wrong, but what if the Devil had just been tricking me? What if he had just been preparing me for doing some great and sinfully evil deed? What if the Devil had dark and occult plans for me and I hadn't been Christian enough to know it? What a stupid and horrible Christian I had become! What a depraved sinner I had turned into! I decided that I would stop doing my neat things, and thanked God for warning me of my sins in time.<br><br>I now know that the subconscious mind, once given its freedom, doesn't give up that freedom without a fight. I didn't know that back then. At the time, to my guilt and horror, it seemed that the more I stopped doing my purposeful "neat things," the more the unbidden things increased. Of course, to my mind at the time, it was simply Satan fighting back. It had nothing to do with conscious and subconscious talents. To my fourteen-year-old mind, it meant only that God and Satan both were testing me. I was in a huge tug-of-war between them, and it required even more diligence of me, or my soul would burn forever in Hell.<br><br>I quickly learned that getting angry was almost certain to bring on an unbidden incident. These incidents were usually bad things, in hindsight, and I was always sorry for them later. Yet, at the time they happened, they seemed to save me from some bully or help someone else who was in need. The things that happened always gave me some instant satisfaction because I was suddenly able to take control of bad situations and turn them to good. But later I would see how the Devil had tricked me again and then the guilt would set in.<br><br>About two months after the incident with the minister and his deacons, the problem still weighed very heavily on me. Then, another incident happened, which was to make me spend the next thirty-one years fully dedicated to blocking these sinful abilities. I was riding my bicycle home from school one day when a kid who was always bullying everyone rode up behind me. As he sped past, he hit my handlebar, and I went spilling forward onto the ground. My face and arm went straight into some sharp gravel. The boy had nothing against me, personally. He only wanted the sport of hurting someone, and I happened to be handy. My dislike of the boy turned to instant hatred. I was hurt and my face and arm were bleeding. I looked up at him as he rode off laughing and heard the little voice in my mind say, "Die!" A sudden very heavy, tiring calmness spread over me. I watched spectator-like as he swept sideways off his bicycle, which continued a short ways down the sidewalk without him. He flew over the hood of a parked car and landed in the street. An oncoming car screeched to a stop with the boy's head already under its bumper and its front tire just inches from his face. If it had not stopped, he would have been killed. I would have been responsible. The minister had been right. Not only was my developing power evil, but now, I was evil, too. I vowed never to use this ability again.<br><br>That plan did not work, of course. Over the years, with some very notable exceptions, I controlled the uninvited occurrences by avoiding anger at all costs. Several spontaneous things did happen both with and without the anger, and of course, no one can go forever without getting upset over something. But I never again heard the voice say, "Die!"<br><br>Not for thirty-one years, anyway, until that day in Augsburg. Doug had ruined my program and made me look like an idiot before my commanders, their commanders, foreign commanders, everyone. I was instantly and uncontrollably furious. I heard the voice and quickly turned my attention back to the computer, but could not control the rage. For the second time in my life, it had said, "Die!" And for the first time since I was fourteen, I felt the very heavy, tiring calmness spread over me. Computers throughout the entire field station went dead.<br><br>During the days that followed (a length of time still classified for obvious reasons), the United States and the other NATO countries that had facilities at the field station had no electronic intelligence effort along the East German border. Field station personnel went to work on regular schedules and kept up the appearance that all was business as usual. We had to fool the Soviets' spy-in-the-sky satellites, which kept constant watch on us.<br><br>I knew inwardly that I had caused the problem, but I wasn't about to tell anyone. For one thing, everyone would have thought I was crazy and laughed at me. I quickly reasoned it all away and convinced myself that I had been wrong. After all, this kind of thing can't happen. I had believed things like that when I was a kid, but I was now an adult. Such thinking was spooky kid stuff. This was just coincidence. So I went to work like everyone else, played cards and worked crossword puzzles, caught up on my reading, and waited for the field station to get up and running again.<br><br>The software analysts checked to see whether my program had caused the computers to crash, but quickly determined that it had not. Except for the "bomb" which Doug had planted in my program, my code was squeaky clean. In fact, the final report of that investigation said that it was the computers crashing that had caused my program to fail. Further analysis showed that unattached and unassociated computer systems had been affected as well. Those systems were totally unconnected to my program. It seems that even stand-alone intelligence computers around Europe and all along the East German border had crashed at the same time. The cause had been something much bigger.

One of the strange things about reporting is that you spend a lot of time with someone and then resume your separate lives. But I occasionally hear from several of the characters in the stories.

With a book, you can follow many different characters and paths. With essays, you have to keep the lens tightly focused. I really believe that some stories need to be told in longer narrative form, and others, like the dozen in <em>The Devil and Sherlock Holmes</em>, work ideally as shorter pieces.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Much of your writing revolves around individuals with unusually strong obsessions. The people you write about have focused their lives on everything from searching for giant squid to disbanding the most powerful gang in the U.S. prison system. Are there any characteristics that these individuals share?</p> <p><strong>David Grann:</strong> Yes, as you mention, many of the characters are compelled by an obsession, even if the object of their obsession is very different. The other thing that many of them share is a curiosity and a hunger to explain, like Sherlock Holmes, the world around them--whether it be the unexplored sea, an underground empire, a secret prison gang, or a mysterious murder.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Many of these stories are rooted in ambiguous circumstances. Did your initial impressions change during the course of researching these people and events?</p> <p><strong>David Grann:</strong> Definitely. When I began investigating these stories, I knew almost nothing about them. Many originated from little more than a tantalizing hint: a tip from a friend, a reference buried in a news brief. And so I hope that I take the reader on the same kind of journey that I experienced--a journey that often leads to conclusions that I never imagined.</p> <p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Many of the stories in <em>The Devil and Sherlock Holmes</em> have a "stranger-than-fiction" quality to them. Have you ever considered trying your hand at fiction, or is the real world strange enough for you?</p> <p><strong>David Grann:</strong> When I first started out as a writer, I had aspirations of becoming a novelist, but I could never invent compelling enough characters or plots. What&#x2019;s wonderful about nonfiction is I get to meet these incredible characters--stick up men, sandhogs, prison escape artists, imposters, squid hunters, mobsters, FBI agents--and they allow me to spend time with them and document their private thoughts. If these dozen stories in the collection taught me anything, it is that life, to borrow a phrase from Sherlock Holmes, "is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent."</p> (Photo � Matt Richman)<p>David Grann&nbsp;is a staff writer at&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>&nbsp;and the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Lost City of Z</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>which has been translated into more than twenty languages.

Follow Anthony on&nbsp;Twitter @AnthonyHorowitz.<br></p>Alex Rider would never forget the moment of impact, the first shock as the parachute opened and the second&#x2014;more jolting still&#x2014;as the module that had carried him back from outer space crashed into the sea. Was it his imagination, or was there steam rising up all around him? Maybe it was sea spray. It didn&#x2019;t matter. He was back. That was all he cared about. He had made it. He was still alive.<br><br>He was still lying on his back, crammed into the tiny space with his knees tucked into his chest. Half closing his eyes, Alex experienced a moment of extraordinary stillness. He was completely still. His fists were clenched. He wasn&#x2019;t breathing. Was it really true? Already he found it impossible to believe that the events that had led to his journey into outer space had really taken place. He tried to imagine himself hurtling around the earth at seventeen and a half thousand miles an hour. It couldn&#x2019;t have happened. It had surely all been part of some incredible dream.<br><br>Slowly he forced himself to unwind. He lifted an arm. It rose normally. He could feel the muscle connecting. Just minutes before he had been in zero gravity. But as he rested, trying to collect his thoughts, he realized that once again his body belonged to him.<br><br>Alex wasn&#x2019;t sure how long he was left on his own, floating on the water somewhere . . . it could have been anywhere in the world. But when things happened, they did so very quickly. First there was the hammering of helicopter blades. Then the whoop of some sort of siren. He could see very little out the window&#x2014;just the rise and fall of the ocean&#x2014;but suddenly a man was there, a scuba diver, a palm slamming against the glass. A few seconds later, the capsule was opened from outside. Fresh air came rushing in, and to Alex it smelled delicious. At the same time, a man loomed over him, his body wrapped in neoprene, his eyes behind a mask.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br>Alex could hardly make out the words, there was so much noise outside. Did the diver have an American accent? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; he managed to shout back. But it wasn&#x2019;t true. He was beginning to feel sick. There was a shooting pain behind his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry! We&#x2019;ll soon have you out of there . . .&#x201d;<br><br>It took them a while. Alex had only been in space a short time, but he&#x2019;d never had any physical training for it, and now his muscles were turning against him, reluctant to start pulling their own weight. He had to be manhandled out of the capsule, into the blinding sun of a Pacific afternoon. Everything was chaotic. There was a helicopter overhead, the blades beating at the ocean, forming patterns that rippled and vibrated. Alex turned his head and saw&#x2014;impossibly&#x2014;an aircraft carrier, as big as a mountain, looming out of the water less than a quarter of a mile away. It was flying the Stars and Stripes. So he had been right about the diver. He must have landed somewhere off the coast of America.<br><br>There were two more divers in the water, bobbing up and down next to the capsule, and Alex could see a third man leaning out of the helicopter directly above him. He knew what was going to happen, and he didn&#x2019;t resist. First a loop of cable was passed around his chest and connected. He felt it tighten under his arms. And then he was rising into the air, still in his space suit, dangling like a silver puppet as he was winched up.<br><br>And already they knew. He had glimpsed it in the eyes of the diver who had spoken to him. The disbelief. These men&#x2014;the helicopter, the aircraft carrier&#x2014;had been rushed out to rendezvous with a module that had just reentered the earth&#x2019;s atmosphere. And inside, they had found a boy. A fourteen-year-old had just plummeted a hundred miles from outer space. These men would be sworn to secrecy, of course. MI6 would see to that. They would never talk about what had happened. Nor would they forget it.<br><br>There was a medical officer waiting for him on board the USS Kitty Hawk&#x2014;which was the name of the ship that had been diverted to pick him up. His name was Josh Cook, and he was forty years old, black with wire-frame glasses and a pleasant, soft-spoken manner. He helped Alex out of the space suit and stayed in the room when Alex finally did throw up. It turned out that he&#x2019;d dealt with astronauts before.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re all sick when they come down,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;It goes with the territory. Or maybe I should say terra firma. That&#x2019;s Latin for &#x2018;down to earth.&#x2019; You&#x2019;ll be fine by the morning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where am I?&#x201d; Alex asked.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re about ninety miles off the coast of Australia. We were on a training exercise when we got a red alert that you were on your way down.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So what happens now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now you have a shower and get some sleep. You&#x2019;re in luck. We&#x2019;ve got a mattress made out of memory foam. It was actually developed by NASA. It&#x2019;ll give your muscles a chance to get used to being back in full gravity.&#x201d;<br><br>Alex had been given a private cabin in the medical department of the Kitty Hawk&#x2014;in fact, a fully equipped &#x201c;hospital at sea&#x201d; with sixty-five beds, an operating room, a pharmacy, and everything else that 5,500 sailors might need. It wasn&#x2019;t huge, but he suspected that nobody else on the Kitty Hawk would have this much space. Cook went over to the corner and pulled back a plastic curtain to reveal a shower cubicle.<br><br>&#x201c;You may find it difficult to walk,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to be unsteady on your feet for at least twenty-four hours. If you like, I can wait in the room until you&#x2019;ve showered.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be okay,&#x201d; Alex said.<br><br>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d; Cook smiled and opened the main door. But before he left, he looked back at Alex. &#x201c;You know&#x2014;every man and woman on this ship is talking about you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There are a whole pile of questions I&#x2019;d like to ask you, but I&#x2019;m under strict orders from the captain to keep my mouth shut. Even so, I want you to know that I&#x2019;ve been at sea for a long, long time and I&#x2019;ve never encountered anything like this. A kid in outer space!&#x201d; He nodded one last time. &#x201c;I hope you have a good rest. There&#x2019;s a call button beside the bed if there&#x2019;s anything you need.&#x201d;<br><br>Cook left.<br><br>It took Alex ten minutes to get into the shower. He had completely lost his sense of balance, and the roll of the ship didn&#x2019;t help. He turned the temperature up as high as he could bear and stood under the steaming water, enjoying the rush of it over his shoulders and through his hair. Then he dried himself and got into bed. The memory foam was only a couple of inches thick, but it seemed to mold itself to the shape of his body exactly. He fell almost instantly into a deep but troubled sleep.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t dream about the Ark Angel space station or his knife fight with Kaspar, the bald ecoterrorist who had been determined to kill him even though it was clear that all was lost. Nor did he dream about Nikolei Drevin, the billionaire who had been behind it all.<br><br>But it did seem to him that, sometime in the middle of the night, he heard the whisper of voices that he didn&#x2019;t recognize but that, somehow, he still knew. Old friends. Or old enemies. It didn&#x2019;t matter which because he couldn&#x2019;t make out what they were saying, and anyway, a moment later they were swept away down the dark river of his sleep.<br><br>Perhaps it was a premonition.<br><br>Because three weeks before, seven men had met in a room in London to discuss an operation that would make them many millions of dollars and would change the shape of the world. And although Alex had never met any of them, he certainly knew them.<br><br>Scorpia was back again.</p><h2>D&#39;Aulaires&#39; Book of Trolls (New York Review Children&#39;s Collection)</h2><p>In this spectacular follow-up to their beloved <i>Book of Norse Myths, </i>the husband-and-wife team of Ingri and Edgar Parin d&#x2019;Aulaire explore the uncanny reaches of Norse mythology, an enchanted night-world populated by trolls of all kinds&#x2014;mountain trolls, forest trolls, trolls who live underwater and trolls who live under bridges, uncouth, unkempt, unbreakable, unforgettable, and invariably unbelievably ugly trolls&#x2014;who work their wiles and carry on in the most bizarre and entertaining fashions. <br><br>With their matchless talent as storytellers and illustrators, the d&#x2019;Aulaires bring to life the weird and wonderful world of Norse mythology.</p><p>In their unique style, the d'Aulaires have created a wonderful picture book about these strange long-ago inhabitants of the wild Norwegian mountains.<p></p><p>"Luminous, magical pictures transport readers deep into the mountains and forests of Norway and into the consciousness of old believers.

In <i>Mastering Cheese</i>, he shares the wealth of his expertise to help cheese lovers on their path to connoisseurship.<br>&nbsp;<br>After years of teaching courses for amateurs at the Artisanal Premium Cheese Center, where he is Dean of Curriculum, McCalman has developed a compelling set of classes for understanding and ex-periencing cheese. A full master's course in a book, <i>Mastering Cheese</i> covers the world of cheese in twenty-two distinct lessons, featuring tasting plates that deliciously demonstrate key topics. For example, a chapter titled "Stunning Stinkers" explains why some of the strongest-smelling cheeses can be among the best tasting and then recommends several stars of this category. Learn about the issues facing real raw-milk cheeses and then go out and taste the differences between these cheeses and those made with pasteurized milk. <br>&nbsp;<br>For the first time in any of his books, McCalman includes extensive information on the modern artisanal cheese revolution in the United States and prominently features these artisans and their products alongside the famous cheeses of Italy, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom.<br>&nbsp;<br>Complete with helpful charts and an invaluable index of more than 300 cheeses, <i>Mastering Cheese</i> is the definitive course that you can use in your own home to pursue your passion for cheese.</p><p><b>MAX MCCALMAN</b> is America's first restaurant-based Ma�tre Fromager and a Garde et Jur�, as designated by France's Guilde des Fromagers. He established the critically acclaimed cheese programs at New York City's Picholine and Artisanal Brasserie &amp; Fromagerie restaurants. He is Dean of Curriculum at Artisanal Premium Cheese Center in New York and is a highly visible advocate for artisanal cheese production around the world. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>DAVID GIBBONS </b>has collaborated on many books, including two with McCalman: <i>The Cheese Plate</i>, which was nominated for James Beard and IACP awards in 2003, and <i>Cheese</i>, which won a James Beard Award in 2006.Starred Review. Cheese experts McCalman and Gibbons already have two James Beard awards for previous fromage-focused tomes (Cheese, The Cheese Plate); this outstanding examination of the subject could nab them another. Regardless, it should be required reading for any cheese-lover. The duo start slowly and distantly, with Sumerians, Mesopotamians, and suggestions for the contemporary cheeses that recall the food&#39;s earliest versions. After explanations of the cheese making process and tips for detecting flavors and determining ripeness, the two roll up their sleeves and attack cheese in all forms and locales. Suggested tastings are frequent and varied, enabling readers to sample at their own pace as they familiarize themselves with different styles and regions. Even those in the business are sure to pick up a few pointers: tips on the art of preparing a cheese trolley, structuring a tasting, and sophisticated topics like the debate over pasteurized and raw milk. Sample menus give readers a painless introduction to the symphonic pairings of a single wine or beer as well as a multi-wine, multi-cheese event. McCalman and Gibbons prove anything but snobby, employing a down-to-earth, encouraging tone and an egalitarian approach to taste, encouraging readers to eat what they like, not necessarily hunt down &#34;the best.&#34;</p><h2>Motherhood - Is It For Me?: Your Step-by-Step Guide to Clarity</h2><p>Many women question whether they want a baby or a childfree life. <i>Motherhood &#x2013; Is It For Me?</i> is the perfect resource for addressing this crucial life choice.

There was something about that place that had been a part of my life beyond my work that I wanted to somehow translate. In the beginning, before avec became avec, we just wanted a little wine bar next to Blackbird to make some money off the wine. But the food was so good, it ended up being about the wine <i>and</i> superdelicious, super-straightforward, super-shareable dishes. And that&#x2019;s really what it&#x2019;s about at its core&#x2014;avec = with. Whenever someone hasn&#x2019;t been in to eat and wants to know what kind of restaurant avec is, I tell them that it&#x2019;s kind of like the best dinner party everyone wishes they could have&#x2014;there&#x2019;s great music, tons&nbsp;of wine, and the food just keeps coming out in waves, all served family style. There&#x2019;s really no designation between appetizers and entr�es&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t need to have the charred asparagus salad first and there&#x2019;s no reason you can&#x2019;t eat our signature &#x201c;deluxe&#x201d; focaccia with Taleggio cheese alongside your main course.<br><br>And while some people like to label our food as European or Mediterranean, I&#x2019;ll be the first to tell you that avec is an American restaurant. Avec chef Perry Hendrix and I are two Midwestern boys making food in the Midwest. All of our ingredients come from the region, or ideally as close to here as possible. But we also like adding ingredients that contribute great flavor, such as za&#x2019;atar or sumac or harissa. We don&#x2019;t necessarily do things the way someone&#x2019;s grandmother did it, and our muhammara might not be the most traditional one there is, but nothing&#x2019;s off-limits. And nothing is overworked. The food itself is simple; there&#x2019;s not one dish coming out of the kitchen that takes longer than three or four minutes once the order goes in. Just like when you&#x2019;re cooking at home, everything is prepped in advance, and many of our staple (and most well-known) dishes&#x2014;brined and braised pork shoulder, whole roasted fish, marinated roasted beets&#x2014;are based on the same tried-and-true methods&nbsp;that we&#x2019;ve been using since we opened, with the addition of maybe three or four different components (vinaigrettes, aiolis, and other schmears, spreads, and crunchy things) that get adjusted with the seasons. It&#x2019;s completely about getting friends together and sharing a great meal, not tweaky food.<br><br>But this book isn&#x2019;t about avec the restaurant; it&#x2019;s about avec the idea. And the idea that inspired avec and its communal, convivial vibe started with my wife, Mary. Before I had the honor of calling her my wife, or even my girlfriend, Mary was in a horrible motorcycle accident in Le Mans, France. (Hang in there; there&#x2019;s a good payoff coming!) The story didn&#x2019;t start there, though. It started with Mary sitting outside of her office on South Michigan Avenue, eating her lunch. A guy walked up and introduced himself&#x2014;his name was J�rg Frehner, and he was traveling around the United States. They got to talking, and over the course of the few weeks that he was in Chicago, he and Mary met up, went out for drinks, and she showed him around. (Luckily he had a serious girlfriend and this was truly platonic&#x2014;or things would have turned out really different for me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.)&nbsp;<br><br>When it was time for J�rg to leave, he invited Mary to&nbsp;come see him in Europe and bike around France. So&nbsp;fast-forward to Le Mans, where he and Mary were hit head-on by a truck, sustained very serious injuries, and were medevaced to a hospital in Gais, Switzerland&#x2014;a little cow town in the Swiss Alps near the Austrian border where J�rg had family. Mary convalesced there for about six weeks, healing from a broken arm and hoping to continue her journey. She ended up meeting a woman named Verena, who had just returned to town, was between jobs, and whose partner was in the military as part of his mandatory service.&nbsp;She had nothing to do, and Mary had nothing to do, so the two of them would go out and get into trouble (but not too much trouble), drinking at the <i>bierstube</i> and hanging out with Verena&#x2019;s friends (who have since become our very close friends and have intermarried with our friends from the States, leading to an unprecedented Chicago-Gais connection).&nbsp;Not long after Mary came back to Chicago, she met me. At the time I was working for Erwin Drechsler at Metropolis Caf�, and he eventually agreed to send me to Europe for my first-ever trip. So as our starting point, Mary decided she would take me back to Switzerland to visit Verena.&nbsp;<br><br>It was 10:30 AM on a Sunday when Verena picked us up at the Zurich airport, but she still had a bottle of Champagne for us to drink while she drove the two&nbsp;and a half hours in a snowstorm back to Gais. Within an hour of getting back to her house&#x2014;a fourhundred-year-old farmhouse with a beautiful wine cellar in the barn, to hold all the great wine she and her partner loved to bring back from Italy, and a big, wood-burning oven in the kitchen&#x2014;a parade of people started to pour in. It turns out we were about to majorly benefit from two Swiss traditions. The first tradition was that Sundays were for visiting. People all&nbsp;over the town would wander between the houses&#x2014; sometimes for miles through forests and multiple feet of snow&#x2014;just to socialize, share a little spread of&nbsp;food, and drink some wine. The second was that, in order to help visitors beat their jet lag, hosts would arrange for people to come over every couple of hours to visit. This also involved eating and drinking wine.&nbsp;<br><br>Over the course of our first afternoon there, about thirty people must have come by and, between arrivals, Verena and her partner would refresh the wine, of which we must have gone through fifteen, twenty, bottles. We were also pulling delicious, simple dishes from the oven, plunking them down on the table right in the pots they&#x2019;d been cooking in. We sliced off hunks of bread, toasted them until they were this side of charred, rubbed &#x2019;em with garlic, and put them out for people to top off with cured meats and all the condiments in tubes that the Swiss can&#x2019;t get enough of. (Seriously, their mustards and mayo and relishes and this Marmite-type stuff all come in tubes.) That&#x2019;s where the seed was planted for avec. It&#x2019;s where the seed was planted for how I cook now whenever I host people at my own home. And it&#x2019;s ultimately the foundation of this book.</p><h2>Command Authority (A Jack Ryan Novel)</h2><p><b><b>In this Jack Ryan thriller, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Tom Clancy delivers an electrifying story of intrigue, power, and a family with two generations of heroes....</b><br></b><br>Decades ago, as a young CIA analyst, President Jack Ryan Sr. was sent out to investigate the death of an operative&#x2014;only to uncover the existence of a KGB assassin codenamed Zenith.

The young captain took in the imagery from the backseat of the taxi as it rolled through Red Square.</p><p>The sight of the flag over the seat of power of the largest country in the world jolted the captain with pride, although Moscow would never feel like home to him. He was Russian, but he&#x2019;d spent the past several years fighting in Afghanistan, and the only Soviet flags he&#x2019;d seen there had been on the uniforms of the men around him.</p><p>His taxi let him out just two blocks from the square, on the north side of the massive GUM department store. He double-checked the address on the drab office building in front of him, paid his fare, and then stepped out into the afternoon rain.</p><p>The building&#x2019;s lobby was small and plain; a lone security man eyed him as he tucked his hat under his arm and climbed a narrow staircase that led to an unmarked door on the first floor.</p><p>Here the captain paused, brushed wrinkles out of his uniform, and ran his hand over his rows of medals to make certain they were perfectly straight.</p><p>Only when he was ready did he knock on the door.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Vkhodi!&#x201d;</i> Come in!</p><p>The young captain entered the small office and shut the door behind him. With his hat in his hand, he stepped in front of the one desk in the room, and he snapped to attention.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Roman Romanovich Talanov, reporting as ordered.&#x201d;</p><p>The man behind the desk looked like he was still in his twenties, which greatly surprised Captain Talanov. He was here to meet a senior officer in the KGB, and he certainly did not expect someone his own age. The man wore a suit and tie, he was small and thin and not particularly fit, and he looked, to the Russian soldier, like he had never spent a day of his life in military service.</p><p>Talanov showed no hint of it, of course, but he was disappointed. For him, like every military man, officers in the KGB were divided into two classes. <i>Sapogi</i> and <i>pidzhaki</i>. Jackboots and jackets. This young man before him might have been a high-ranking state security official, but to the soldier, he was just a civilian. A jacket.</p><p>The man stood, walked around the desk, and then sat down on its edge. His slight slouch contrasted with the ramrod-straight posture of the officer standing in front of him.</p><p>The KGB man did not give his name. He said, &#x201c;You just returned from Afghanistan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, comrade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t ask you how it was, because I would not understand, and that would probably just piss you off.&#x201d;</p><p>The captain stood still as stone.</p><p>The jacket said, &#x201c;You are GRU Spetsnaz. Special Forces. You&#x2019;ve been operating behind the lines in Afghanistan. Even over the border in Pakistan.&#x201d;</p><p>It was not a question, so the captain did not reply.</p><p>With a smile, the man slouched on the desk said, &#x201c;Even as a member of the most elite special operations unit in military intelligence, you stand out above the rest. Intelligence, resilience, initiative.&#x201d; He winked at Talanov. &#x201c;Loyalty.&#x201d;</p><p>Talanov&#x2019;s blue eyes were locked on a point on the wall behind the desk, so he missed the wink. With a powerful voice, he replied with a well-practiced mantra: &#x201c;I serve the Soviet Union.&#x201d;</p><p>The jacket half rolled his eyes, but again Talanov missed it. &#x201c;Relax, Captain. Look at me, not the wall. I am not your commanding officer. I am just a comrade who wishes to have a conversation with another comrade, not a fucking robot.&#x201d;</p><p>Talanov did <i>not</i> relax, but his eyes did shift to the KGB man.</p><p>&#x201c;You were born in Ukraine. In Kherson, to Russian parents.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, comrade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am from Saint Petersburg myself, but I spent my summers with my grandmother in Odessa, not far from where you grew up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, comrade.&#x201d;</p><p>The jacket blew out a sigh, frustrated at the continued formality of the Spetsnaz man. He asked, &#x201c;Are you proud of those medals on your chest?&#x201d;</p><p>Talanov&#x2019;s face gave away his first emotion now. It was indecision. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they are&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I serve the&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You serve the Soviet Union. <i>Da</i>, Captain, duly noted. But what if I told you I wanted you to take off those medals and never put them back on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not understand, comrade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have followed your career, especially the operations you have conducted behind the lines. And we have researched every aspect of your private life, what little there is of it. From this we have come to the conclusion that you are less interested in the good of the Communist Party, and more interested in the work itself. You, dear Captain, have a slavish desire to excel. But we do not detect in you any particular passion for the joys of the collective or any unique wonderment at the command economy.&#x201d;</p><p>Talanov remained silent. Was this a test of his loyalty to the party?</p><p>The jacket continued. &#x201c;Chairman Chernenko will be dead in months. Perhaps weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>Captain Talanov blinked. <i>What madness is this talk?</i> If someone said such a thing in front of a KGB man on base back in Afghanistan, they would be shuffled away, never to be seen again.</p><p>The jacket said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true. They hide him from the public because he&#x2019;s in a wheelchair, and he spends most of the time up in Kuntsevo at the Kremlin Clinic. Heart, lungs, liver: Nothing on that old bastard is working anymore. Gorbachev will succeed him as general secretary&#x2014;surely you&#x2019;ve heard he&#x2019;s next in line. Even out in some cave in Afghanistan, that <i>must</i> be common knowledge by now.&#x201d;</p><p>The young officer gave up nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;You are wondering how I know this?&#x201d;</p><p>Slowly, Talanov said, &#x201c;<i>Da,</i> comrade. I <i>am</i> wondering that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know this because I have been told by people who are worried. Worried about the future, worried about where Gorbachev will take the Union. Worried about where Reagan is taking the West. Worried everything might come crashing down on top of us.&#x201d;</p><p>There were a few seconds of complete silence in the room, and then the KGB suit said, &#x201c;Seems impossible, I know. But I am assured there is reason for concern.&#x201d;</p><p>Talanov couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore. He needed to know what was going on. &#x201c;I was ordered to come here today by General Zolotov. He told me I was being considered for recruitment into a special project for the KGB.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Misha Zolotov knew what he was doing when he sent you to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You <i>do</i> work for the KGB, yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do, indeed. But more specifically, I work for a group of survivors. Men in KGB and GRU, men who know that the continued existence of our organizations <i>is</i> the survival of the nation, the survival of the people. The Kremlin does not run this nation. A certain building in Dzerzhinsky Square runs this nation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The KGB building?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Da.</i> And I have been tasked with protecting this building, not the Communist Party.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And General Zolotov?&#x201d;</p><p>The jacket smiled. &#x201c;Is in the club. As I said, a few in GRU are on board.&#x201d;</p><p>The man in the suit came very close now, his face inches from the chiseled cheekbones of Roman Talanov. In a voice barely above a whisper he said, &#x201c;If I were you I would be saying to myself, &#x2018;What the fuck is going on? I thought I was being recruited into the KGB, but instead I&#x2019;ve just met a crazy man talking about the impending death of the general secretary and the possibility of the fall of the Union.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Talanov turned to face him and squared his shoulders. &#x201c;Every word you&#x2019;ve said here, comrade, is treasonous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is true, but as there are no recording devices in this room, it would take you to stand up as a witness against me. That would not be wise, Captain Talanov, as those survivors that I mentioned are at the very top, and they would protect me. What they would do to you, I can only imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>Talanov looked back to the wall. &#x201c;So&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am being asked to join the KGB, but not to do the work of the KGB. I will, instead, do the work of this group of leaders.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, exactly, Roman Romanovich.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What will I be doing specifically?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The same sort of things you have been doing in Kabul and Peshawar and Kandahar and Islamabad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wet work?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. You will help ensure the security of the operation, despite what changes the Soviet Union undergoes in the next few years. In return, you will be protected no matter what might happen in the future regarding the Union.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I still do not understand what you think will happen in the future.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you listening to me? It&#x2019;s not what <i>I</i> think. How the fuck should <i>I</i> know? It&#x2019;s like this, Talanov. The USSR is a large boat, you and I are two of the passengers. We are sitting on the deck, thinking everything is just perfect, but then&#x201d;&#x2014;the KGB man moved around the room dramatically, as though he was acting out a scene&#x2014;&#x201c;wait&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what&#x2019;s this? Some of the boat&#x2019;s best officers are preparing to abandon ship!&#x201d;</p><p>He moved back in front of Talanov. &#x201c;I might not see the iceberg in our path, but when those in charge are looking for the <i>fucking</i> lifeboat, I&#x2019;m smart enough to pay attention.</p><p>&#x201c;Now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have been asked to tend to the lifeboat, a great responsibility entrusted to me by the officers.&#x201d; The jacket grinned. &#x201c;Will you help me with the lifeboat?&#x201d;</p><p>Captain Talanov was a straightforward man. The metaphors were starting to piss him off. &#x201c;The lifeboat. What <i>is</i> it?&#x201d;</p><p>The jacket shrugged his narrow shoulders. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s money. It&#x2019;s just fucking money. A series of black funds will be established and maintained around the world. I will do it, and you will help me keep the funds secure from threats both inside and outside the Union. It will be a simple assignment, a few years in duration, I should think, but it will require the best efforts of us both.&#x201d;</p><p>The man in the suit walked to a small refrigerator that sat against the wall between two bookshelves. He pulled out a bottle of vodka, and then he grabbed two stemmed shot glasses from a shelf. He came back to the desk and filled them both.</p><p>While he did all this, Captain Roman Talanov just looked on.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have a drink to celebrate.&#x201d;</p><p>Talanov cocked his head. &#x201c;Celebrate? I haven&#x2019;t agreed to anything, comrade.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. You haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d; The man in the suit smiled and passed over one of the glasses to the bewildered military man. &#x201c;Not yet. But you will come around soon enough, because you and I are the same.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The same?&#x201d;</p><p>The jacket raised his glass to Talanov. &#x201c;Yes. Just like the men at the top who came up with this scheme, you and I are both survivors.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>Present day</p><p>The black Bronco shot through the storm, its tires kicking up mud and water and grit as it raced along the gravel road, and rain pelted the windshield faster than the wipers could clear it.</p><p>As the truck charged along at sixty miles an hour, the back doors opened and two armed men climbed out and into the rain, one on each side. The men stood on the running boards and held on to the door frame with gloved hands. Their eyes were protected from the mud and flying rocks and water by large goggles, but their black Nomex suits and the submachine guns around their necks were wet and mud-splattered in moments along with the rest of their gear: helmets with integrated headsets, ballistic protection on their chests and backs, knee and elbow pads, and magazine pouches. Everything was soaked and caked with mud by the time the Bronco closed on a cabin in the center of a rain-swept pasture.</p><p>The vehicle decelerated quickly, skidding to a stop just twenty feet from the front door. The two men on the running boards leapt off and raced toward the building, their weapons scanning the trees all around, searching for any targets. The driver of the Bronco joined soon after; just like the others, he carried an H&amp;K submachine gun with a fat silencer on the end of the barrel.</p><p>The three operators formed in a tight stack near the entrance, and the man in front reached forward and tried the door latch.</p><p>It was locked.</p><p>The man in the back of the stack&#x2014;the driver&#x2014;stepped forward now, without a word. He let his H&amp;K drop free on his chest, and he reached behind his back and pulled a pistol-grip shotgun from his pack. The weapon was loaded with Disintegrator breaching rounds: three-inch magnum shells with fifty-gram projectiles made of a steel powder bound by plastic.</p><p>The operator placed the barrel of the shotgun six inches from the top hinge of the door, and he fired a Disintegrator directly into the hinge. With an enormous boom and a wide blast of flame, the steel powder load slammed into the wood, blowing the hinge from the door frame.</p><p>He fired a second round into the lower hinge, then kicked the door, which fell into the room beyond.</p><p>The shotgunner stepped to the side and the two men holding automatic weapons rushed into the dark room, guns up and weapon lights burning arcs in the black. The driver restowed his shotgun, grabbed his H&amp;K, and joined up with the others in the room.</p><p>Each man had a sector to clear and did so quickly and efficiently. In three seconds they began moving toward a hallway that led to the rear of the cabin.</p><p>Two open doorways were in front of them now, one on each side of the hall, with a closed door down at the end. The first and second men in the train peeled away; number one went left through the doorway, and number two went into the room on the right. Both men found targets and fired; suppressed rounds thumped loudly in the confined space of the cabin.</p><p>While the first two men were engaging in the rooms, the lone man still in the hallway kept his weapon trained on the door ahead, knowing full well he would be exposed from behind if anyone entered the cabin from the outside.</p><p>Quickly the two men returned to the hallway and aimed their guns forward, and the man at the rear turned around to check behind them. A second later they moved on to the closed door.

Everyone knows the Bible teaches scientific nonsense that s the commonly held misconception. When pushed for examples, skeptics point to the early part of Genesis, with stories of creation, the flood, and 900-year life spans as proof. Examining recent scientific discoveries, astronomer and pastor Dr. Hugh Ross explores the opening chapters in Genesis and shows how they hold some of the strongest scientific evidence for the Bible s supernatural accuracy. Navigating Genesis expands upon Ross earlier book The Genesis Question (1998), integrating the message of both the Bible and science without compromise giving skeptics and believers common ground for dialogue.</p><p></p><h2>Collected Ghost Stories (Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural)</h2><p>M.R. James is probably the finest ghost-story writer England has ever produced. These tales are not only classics of their genre, but are also superb examples of beautifully-paced understatement, convincing background and chilling terror. <br> As well as the preface, there is a fascinating tail-piece by M.R. James, Stories I Have Tried To Write , which accompanies these thirty tales. Among them are 'Casting the Runes', 'Oh, Whistle and I'll come to you, My Lad', 'The Tractate Middoth', 'The Ash Tree' and 'Canon Alberic's Scrapbook'. <br> There are some authors one wishes one had never read in order to have the joy of reading them for the first time. For me, M.R. James is one of these . Ruth Rendall</p><p>M(ontague) R(hodes) James (1862-1936), the son of a Kent curate, enjoyed a glittering academic career, and was acknowledged as a leading authority on medieval manuscripts and biblical apocrypha. By way of diversion, over a period of time he wrote thirty four of what are acknowledged to be the best ghost stories ever written. The passing of time does not lessen their popularity or their ability to chill, and our edition of &#39;Collected Ghost Stories&#39; remains the best-selling book in the series.</p><h2>The Christmas Bouquet: An Anthology (A Chesapeake Shores Novel, 11)</h2><p><p><b>When it comes to family and Christmas, #1 New York Times bestselling author Sherryl Woods always looks to the O'Briens for a little holiday magic.&nbsp;</b></p><p>For the very driven medical student Caitlyn Winters, catching the bridal bouquet at a Christmas wedding has set off a chain reaction that she's sure is more curse than blessing. Not only has she fallen in love with family medicine resident Noah McIlroy, but an unexpected pregnancy threatens her well-laid plans for the future. It doesn't help that Noah&#x2014;with a whole lot of help from Caitlyn's O'Brien relatives&#x2014;is completely on board with the prospect of marriage and happily-ever-after.&nbsp;</p><p>It takes a whole lot of patience, love and family persuasion to help Caitlyn realize that she can still have everything she ever wanted, including a home in her beloved Chesapeake Shores and a man who understands all her dreams.</p></p><p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.</p>Tt was all because of that blasted bridal bouquet, Caitlyn Winters thought as she stared in dismay at the positive pregnancy test in her hand. From the moment she'd caught the bouquet at Jenny Collins's Christmas wedding in New York a little over a year ago, she'd been doomed. That instinctive grab of an object flying straight at her had changed her life.<br><br>Her twin sister, Carrie, who'd all but shoved her aside to try to snatch the bouquet from the air, was going to laugh herself silly at what had transpired since that night. So were the rest of the O'Briens, for that matter. They loved irony.<br><br>Noah Mcllroy, the family medicine resident whom she'd met soon after the wedding and with whom she'd been having a serious relationship since last September, tapped on the bathroom door.<br><br>"Caitlyn, are you okay?"<br><br>A hysterical laugh bubbled up, but she fought to contain it. This was no laughing matter. "Fine," she managed to squeak out just as the door opened. Noah's gaze shifted from her face to land on the test strip she was holding. Concern immediately evolved into astonishment.<br><br>"You're pregnant?" he asked, his eyes filled with surprise, but a smile already tugging at his lips.<br><br>His wonderful, sensual lips, which had gotten them into this mess, she thought wryly. Of course, she was well aware those lips hadn't caused her pregnancy. Heck, she'd known about the birds and bees long before that, thanks to all the romances in Chesapeake Shores and among her amorous O'Brien relatives.<br><br>But it was her inability to resist Noah's heated kisses that had led to all the rest. That and an apparently defective condom. Given her cautious nature, she probably should have insisted on at least three methods of birth control, but no, she'd trusted Noah when he'd assured her that the condoms would be sufficient.<br><br>The man had cast a spell over her from the minute they'd met, literally one week after she'd caught that blasted romantic bouquet with all its superstition attached like streamers of satin ribbon. The deft catch had earned hoots of laughter from her family and a stunned, disappointed scowl from her twin, who'd been angling for the bouquet all evening.<br><br>And now, here she was, barely more than a year later, and pregnant. She hadn't even accepted Noah's repeated pleas that they live together, even though he was in her apartment more often than he was in his own. She'd drawn a line at that, knowing that she'd never be able to keep his presence in her life a secret from her nosy family if they were actually living under the same roof.<br><br>And she'd wanted to keep this relationship a secret. After all, she was supposed to be the grounded, goaloriented sister. Carrie was the one everyone had expected to fall madly in love and marry before her college graduation. Instead, Carrie was jetting around the world, leading a completely carefree life, building a career in public relations for a big fashion designer and tossing away men like used tissues while she pined for one unobtainable man. And Caitlyn, thanks to that bouquet, was standing here with a positive pregnancy test in her hand!<br><br>She recalled the forget-me-nots that her aunt Bree had tucked into Jenny's simple bridal bouquet and fought back another hysterical laugh. She was hardly likely to forget this moment, that's for sure.<br><br>She drew in a deep breath and finally dared to meet Noah's gaze. For a man supposedly as dedicated to his medical career as she was to hers, he looked awfully pleased about this unexpected bump in the road. Of course, he was just a couple of months away from launching his career, while she still had the long years of an internship and residency to complete.<br><br>"Wipe that smile off your face," she instructed him firmly. "This is not good news."<br><br>His smile only spread, revealing that appealing dimple that had also sucked her right in. "It's the best possible news," he contradicted.<br><br>"Noah, you may see the light at the end of the tunnel, but be real. You'll finish your residency at the end of June and you still have to decide where you want to go into practice and get established. I haven't even started my internship. We might not even be living in the same city a few months from now. A baby doesn't fit into the plan."<br><br>"You know what they say," he began.<br><br>"Don't you dare remind me that God laughs while we're making plans."<br><br>She frowned for emphasis as she passed him on her way into the bedroom, where she sank down on the side of the bed. Maybe if she sat for a minute, she could think. Thinking clearly had always been her best trait.<br><br>She'd known what she wanted for her life by her teens. After spending a summer volunteering in a doctor's office in a medically underserved community in Appalachia and seeing reports about villages in third-world countries that were even worse off, she'd found her calling. Her reward had been the healthy children who'd clustered around her at the end of the summer to say goodbye, the moms who'd hugged her with tears in their eyes.<br><br>Just like her ambitious mother, Abby O'Brien Winters Riley, Caitlyn had thought her future through very carefully. There would be college, medical school, an internship and residency. Then she'd use all that knowledge to help children in parts of the world where medical help was severely lacking. She'd make a difference, just like everyone else in her family had in their own way. This was her way to shine, to live up to all those family expectations and at the same time do the kind of meaningful work she'd been born to do.<br><br>She'd been so focused that she'd managed to complete college in three years, then set out to whip through medical school and all of her rotations as fast as they'd allowed her to. Every summer she'd either crammed in more courses or served in another needy community, most recently in Africa with the Red Cross. While Carrie was the social butterfly, Caitlyn had been driven, not allowing a single distraction. Not until Noah, anyway.<br><br>She glanced up at him as he studied her with a worried expression. He was so incredibly gorgeous, it was little wonder that her heart seemed to stop whenever she looked at him. But it wasn't his looks that had made her fall in love. He'd seemed as driven as she was, determined to be the kind of old-fashioned doctor who was more concerned with treating his patients with compassion and dignity than racking up huge bucks on office visits and unnecessary testing.<br><br>They'd met on her rotation through the family medicine service right after that fateful wedding. She'd been immediately smitten by his dedication, the thoughtful kindness he displayed to everyone from patients to the most inept medical students still struggling to adapt book learning to practical experience. He'd turned her into a better doctor by example, no question about it. He'd suggested she waver from her original intention to focus on pediatrics and steered her into choosing family medicine. He'd helped her see that she could serve even more people with that well-rounded specialty.<br><br>Until she'd worked with him, she'd understood everything in her textbooks, but she hadn't mastered the instinctive diagnostic skills that made the difference between being competent and excelling. He'd taught her to listen to more than a list of symptoms, to hear what her patients weren't saying, as much as to what they said.<br><br>By fall, when she'd started her final year of medical school, they were in an exclusive relationship, stealing time to be together whenever they could. With their competing, demanding schedules, those stolen moments had been few and far between. Given the test strip she was holding, they'd been more than sufficient to alter her life apparently.<br><br>Noah dropped down beside her now and took her hand in his. "We're going to be okay," he said softly, his warm brown eyes filled with tenderness.<br><br>When she didn't answer, he touched her chin. "Look at me, Cait." Only after she'd turned her head, fighting tears, did he repeat, "We're going to be okay."<br><br>"How?" she asked him, unable to imagine it, unable to accept his confidently spoken reassurance.<br><br>"We'll get married," he said without hesitation. "I know we haven't talked about that yet, but you know I love you. I want a future with you. This just bumps up the timetable. I'm all but finished with my residency. I'll go into practice in July. You'll finish your internship and residency. Then you can join me in the practice."<br><br>She listened to the logical simplicity of his plan and regarded him incredulously, panicked by the certainty in his voice.<br><br>"That's <em>your</em> dream, Noah. Not mine. You know what I want, what I've worked so hard for. There's a big world out there in desperate need of medical help. I want to save the lives of babies in third-world countries who might not make it without a doctor in their village. The two weeks I spent in Africa last year..." Her voice trailed off and hitched as she thought about the desperation she'd seen everywhere she'd turned. "That time confirmed everything for me. I was meant to do that kind of work. I promised I'd be back."<br><br>To his credit he didn't dismiss her dream or the promise she'd made. They'd talked about it often enough. He knew how much it meant to her to go where she was needed. It was what she'd stayed up nights studying for. She'd known it from the first time she'd seen those malnourished children with their wide desperate eyes on the news. Every volunteer assignment she'd taken after that had only solidified her resolve.<br><br>"Then how do you see this going?" he asked quietly.<br><br>She wanted to blurt out that she'd have to end the pregnancy, but how could she? While she might believe in every woman's right to choose, she knew she'd never be able to live with herself if she chose abortion. She was a healer. And this was Noah's baby, an unexpected blessing under any other circumstances.<br><br>"I don't know," she whispered, hot tears falling.<br><br>Noah pulled her into his arms and held her against his chest, surrounding her with his strength and heat and that scary, unwavering certainty. "We'll figure it out," he promised. "Together, we'll figure out what's best."<br><br>For just an instant, Caitlyn allowed herself to believe that. She desperately wanted to hold on to the possibility that there was an answer that worked for both of them. But in every scenario she envisioned, she lost.<br><br>Noah knew a baby wasn't in Cait's plans, not right now, anyway. It killed him to see her so utterly miserable when he wanted to shout his joy from the rooftop. The timing might be lousy in so many ways, but the news filled him with hope that this child would bind the two of them together forever.<br><br>She'd been right about one thing: marriage and sharing a medical practice <em>was</em> his dream. He'd wanted that from the minute she'd started on his service at the hospital with her exhaustive textbook knowledge of medicine, her instinctive diagnostic skills that even now she didn't recognize that she possessed and her unquenchable thirst to learn everything he had to teach her. Her silky skin and untamed red curls had captivated him, too, no question about it. Every male at the hospital stared after her as she bounced through her days with boundless energy and optimism, spreading smiles in her wake.<br><br>Over the next few weeks they'd shared enough late nights and coffee it was a wonder either of them had ever slept a wink with all that caffeine racing through their systems. He'd never been much of a talker, but with Caitlyn, he hadn't been able to keep quiet. There'd been so much he'd wanted to share, so many things about her he'd wanted to learn.<br><br>She'd made him laugh with her endless stream of stories about her large Irish-American family and teased him unmercifully because his own background was Scottish. She'd claimed she could never take him home because of it.<br><br>He'd thought at the time she was joking, but now he couldn't help wondering. They'd been inseparable for most of the past year, but he still hadn't been invited to Chesapeake Shores, which wasn't that far away. Was he wrong about how much he meant to her? Was he only someone with whom she could spend time until the day she finished her residency and went off to begin her "real" life? Did she view him as safe, someone she could leave behind without regrets?<br><br>No, he thought heatedly. He wasn't wrong about their feelings. He couldn't be. He wasn't the only one in love. Cait loved him, too. He might not have a lot of experience with serious relationships&#x2014;how many doctors had enough time to properly date during all those years of school and training, after all?&#x2014;but he could recognize that what he'd found with Cait was special.<br><br>Sitting across the room on the edge of the bed where she'd left him, he watched her now as she pulled her strawberry-red hair into a severe knot intended to tame the curls. He smiled as a few escaped to brush her cheeks. It reminded him of the way she lived her life, desperately trying to control everything, but a wild streak coming out when she least expected it. He could recall with total clarity the last time she'd cut loose with total abandon. He liked imagining that was the night this baby had been conceived, with neither of them thinking of anything but each other.<br><br>"Cait," he said softly. "I think it's time I meet this crazy family of yours."<br><br>In her mirrored reflection, he saw her eyes go wide with alarm.<br><br>"Now?"<br><br>"Can you think of a better time? They have to be told about what's going on."<br><br>She shook her head. "Not a chance, Noah. Not until we know what we're going to do. Maybe not even then. My mom, she's great. She'll handle this okay. My great-grandmother&#x2014;"<br><br>"Nell O'Brien, right?"</p><h2>Intimate Connections</h2><p>In this breakthrough book, Dr. David Burns, M.D., author of the bestselling <i>Feeling Good</i>, applies the proven principles of Cognitive Therapy to eliminating the negative thinking and low self-esteem that causes loneliness and shyness.

Christians have already begun to know God and his truth. This handbook assists in that liberating knowledge, as it opens up the great themes of God's Word and shows how they fit together. Each chapter deals with one aspect of biblical truth and encourages further study with Scripture references to look up, questions for discussion, and books for additional reading. The main sections conclude with practical reflection on how the Bible's teaching challenges us and moves us to adore the living God. This new edition of Bruce Milne's widely appreciated <em>Know the Truth</em> has been extensively revised and updated to ensure its ongoing relevance and value as an excellent introduction to Christian doctrine.</p><p><strong>Bruce Milne</strong> was pastor of First Baptist Church in Vancouver, Canada, for many years. Today he travels the globe, preaching, teaching and encouraging pastoral leaders. He is the author of <em>The Message of John</em> and <em>The Message of Heaven and Hell</em> in The Bible Speaks Today commentary series.&#34;It is a privilege to commend so sensible, clear and fruitful an overview of basic Christian belief . . . and Bruce Milne&#39;s fresh comments (in this third edition) make what was already a very useful book more useful still.&#34; (J. I. Packer)</p><h2>Up the Mountain Path</h2><p>Mrs. Badger, an avid collector and naturalist, takes a weekly journey up to Sugarloaf Peak, greeting her friends on the way and sharing her discoveries with them. One day she meets Lulu, a very small cat, who wants to go with her to the top of the mountain. On the way, Lulu learns to take care of the natural world, help those in need, and listen to her intuition. Rich in wisdom and beautifully illustrated, Up the Mountain Path offers a profound story full of lessons about love, generosity, and following one&#39;s heart.</p><p>Montreal-based Marianne Dubuc is an award-winning author and illustrator of more than ten picture books, including <em>The Fish and the Cat</em> and <em>The Lion and the Bird</em>.PreS-Gr 2-Mrs. Badger, a badger of advanced years, climbs to a mountain peak every Sunday. On her walk, she greets her forest friends, giving gifts, and offering a helping hand. One day she meets a cat named, Lulu. She invites Lulu to walk to the mountain peak with her. Lulu isn't sure she can make the climb. After they craft the perfect walking stick, they begin to walk together. Lulu asks a lot of questions, and Mrs. Badger teaches her to quietly listen and observe the world around her. From then on, Mrs. Badger and Lulu climb the mountain together. As time passes, it is Lulu who needs to lend Mrs. Badger a steadying hand over the steep spots. Eventually, Lulu must climb to the peak without Mrs. Badger. Softly rendered pencil, colored pencil, and watercolor illustrations of forest scenes capture the grandness of nature, from a tiny hedgehog family to sweeping mountain vistas. Vignettes of the rosy-cheeked Mrs. Badger and her friends in conversation break up the forest illustrations and add interest. The text is in a small font, unassuming and, full of gentle wisdom from Mrs. Badger. VERDICT Mindfulness can be a difficult concept to understand, and this book is thoughtfully crafted to show quiet contemplation and serenity in action. A perfect choice for budding naturalists as well.-Mindy Hiatt, Salt Lake County Library Services&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

He held at least one major title every season of his career and electrified the world with his 1930 Grand Slam, winning all four major amateur and open tournaments in the United States and Great Britain.<br><br><i>Bobby Jones on Golf</i> is a distillation of all that he learned about playing golf over more than half a century of devotion to amateur competition. Drawing both on the practical and the theoretical, this classic work addresses such topics as the feel of the club, placing the feet, using the body, and cultivating the proper backswing. Like the author's impeccable reputation, <i>Bobby Jones on Golf </i>is as timeless as the game itself.</p><p>Here's the bad news: "Golf," suggests the great Bobby Jones, the largest shadow ever cast on a fairway, "is the one game which becomes more and more difficult the longer one plays it." Here's the good news: If his classic instructional can't change the diagnosis, it may at least ease the pain. Written by the master himself--no ghost ever stepped between Jones and his ball--as a series of twice-weekly newspaper columns between 1927 and 1935, the collection of tips and ideas moves from the simple ("Nobody ever swung a golf club too slowly") to the complex ("The art of appraising slope and speed--that is, of reading a green, can be derived only from experience"), the physical to the mental, the obvious to the arcane, and is penned with an elegance as smooth and fluid as Jones' liquid swing. Some of it, especially to golf's newcomers, will seem out of date--the game has changed much through the years--but that's OK; this is a book to savor as much as learn from. It's biggest drawback is its lack of illustrations, but the recent uncovering of a cache of unpublished photographs and tips--available in Jones' <i>Classic Instruction</i>--repairs <i>that</i> divot. Indeed, taken together, Jones' <i>On Golf</i> and <i>Classic Instruction</i> should cure several Royal and Ancient disorders. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>By the best amateur golfer ever to play the game, this is essential instructional reading for the millions who have taken up golf during the 20 years this marvelous, timeless book has been out of print and unavailable.<p> B &amp; W line drawings.</p></p><h2>King Richard III: Third Series (The Arden Shakespeare Third Series)</h2><p><p>Richard III is one of the great Shakespearean characters and roles. James R Siemon examines the attraction of this villain to audiences and focuses on how beguiling, even funny, he can be, especially in the earlier parts of the play.

Here, in this straightforward, thoughtful, and thought-provoking book, she sets out a program that can lead us toward a more compassionate life.<br><br>The twelve steps Armstrong suggests begin with &#x201c;Learn About Compassion&#x201d; and close with &#x201c;Love Your Enemies.&#x201d; In between, she takes up &#x201c;compassion for yourself,&#x201d; mindfulness, suffering, sympathetic joy, the limits of our knowledge of others, and &#x201c;concern for everybody.&#x201d; She suggests concrete ways of enhancing our compassion and putting it into action in our everyday lives, and provides, as well, a reading list to encourage us to &#x201c;hear one another&#x2019;s narratives.&#x201d; Throughout, Armstrong makes clear that a compassionate life is not a matter of only heart or mind but a deliberate and often life-altering commingling of the two.</p></p><p><p><b>Karen Armstrong</b>&nbsp;is the author of numerous other books on religious affairs&#x2014;including&nbsp;<i>A History of God, The Battle for God, The Case for God, Islam, Buddha,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Great Transformation&#x2014;</i>and two memoirs,&nbsp;<i>Through the Narrow Gate</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Spiral Staircase</i>.

Each year TED (the acronym for Technology, Entertainment, Design), a private nonprofit organization best known for its superb conferences on &#x201c;ideas worth spreading,&#x201d; gives awards to people whom they think have made a difference but who, with their help, could make even more of an impact. Other winners have included former U.S. president Bill Clinton, the scientist E. O. Wilson, and the British chef Jamie Oliver. The recipient is given $100,000 but, more important, is granted a wish for a better world. I knew immediately what I wanted. One of the chief tasks of our time must surely be to build a global community in which all peoples can live together in mutual respect; yet religion, which should be making a major contribution, is seen as part of the problem. All faiths insist that compassion is the test of true spirituality and that it brings us into relation with the transcendence we call God, Brahman, Nirvana, or Dao. Each has formulated its own version of what is sometimes called the Golden Rule, &#x201c;Do not treat others as you would not like them to treat you,&#x201d; or in its positive form, &#x201c;Always treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself.&#x201d; Further, they all insist that you cannot confine your benevolence to your own group; you must have concern for everybody&#x2014;even your enemies.<br><br>Yet sadly we hear little about compassion these days. I have lost count of the number of times I have jumped into a London taxi and, when the cabbie asks how I make a living, have been informed categorically that religion has been the cause of all the major wars in history. In fact, the causes of conflict are usually greed, envy, and ambition, but in an effort to sanitize them, these self-serving emotions have often been cloaked in religious rhetoric. There has been much flagrant abuse of religion in recent years. Terrorists have used their faith to justify atrocities that violate its most sacred values. In the Roman Catholic Church, popes and bishops have ignored the suffering of countless women and children by turning a blind eye to the sexual abuse committed by their priests. Some religious leaders seem to behave like secular politicians, singing the praises of their own denomination and decrying their rivals with scant regard for charity. In their public pronouncements, they rarely speak of compassion but focus instead on such secondary matters as sexual practices, the ordination of women, or abstruse doctrinal formulations, implying that a correct stance on these issues&#x2014;rather than the Golden Rule&#x2014;is the criterion of true faith.<br><br>Yet it is hard to think of a time when the compassionate voice of religion has been so sorely needed. Our world is dangerously polarized. There is a worrying imbalance of power and wealth and, as a result, a growing rage, malaise, alienation, and humiliation that has erupted in terrorist atrocities that endanger us all. We are engaged in wars that we seem unable either to end or to win. Disputes that were secular in origin, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, have been allowed to fester and become &#x201c;holy,&#x201d; and once they have been sacralized, positions tend to harden and become resistant to pragmatic solutions. And yet at the same time we are bound together more closely than ever before through the electronic media. Suffering and want are no longer confined to distant, disadvantaged parts of the globe. When stocks plummet in one country, there is a domino effect in markets all around the world. What happens today in Gaza or Afghanistan is now likely to have repercussions tomorrow in London or New York. We all face the terrifying possibility of environmental catastrophe. In a world in which small groups will increasingly have powers of destruction hitherto confined to the nation-state, it has become imperative to apply the Golden Rule globally, ensuring that all peoples are treated as we would wish to be treated ourselves. If our religious and ethical traditions fail to address this challenge, they will fail the test of our time.<br><br>So at the award ceremony in February 2008, I asked TED to help me create, launch, and propagate a Charter for Compassion that would be written by leading thinkers from a variety of major faiths and would restore compassion to the heart of religious and moral life. The charter would counter the voices of extremism, intolerance, and hatred. At a time when religions are widely assumed to be at loggerheads, it would also show that, despite our significant differences, on this we are all in agreement and that it is indeed possible for the religious to reach across the divide and work together for justice and peace.<br><br>Thousands of people from all over the world contributed to a draft charter on a multilingual website in Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, and English; their comments were presented to the Council of Conscience, a group of notable individuals from six faith traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism), who met in Switzerland in February 2009 to compose the final version:<br><br>"The principle of compassion lies at the heart of all religious, ethical and spiritual traditions, calling us always to treat all others as we wish to be treated ourselves.<br><br>Compassion impels us to work tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures, to dethrone ourselves from the centre of our world and put another there, and to honour the inviolable sanctity of every single human being, treating everybody, without exception, with absolute justice, equity and respect.<br><br>It is also necessary in both public and private life to refrain consistently and empathically from inflicting pain. To act or speak violently out of spite, chauvinism or self-interest, to impoverish, exploit or deny basic rights to anybody, and to incite hatred by denigrating others&#x2014;even our enemies&#x2014;is a denial of our common humanity. We acknowledge that we have failed to live compassionately and that some have even increased the sum of human misery in the name of religion.<br><br>We therefore call upon all men and women<br><br>�&nbsp;to restore compassion to the centre of morality and religion;<br><br>�&nbsp;to return to the ancient principle that any interpretation of scripture that breeds violence, hatred or disdain is illegitimate;<br><br>�&nbsp;to ensure that youth are given accurate and respectful information about other traditions, religions and cultures;<br><br>�&nbsp;to encourage a positive appreciation of cultural and religious diversity;<br><br>�&nbsp;to cultivate an informed empathy with the suffering of all human beings&#x2014;even those regarded as enemies.<br><br>We urgently need to make compassion a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend selfishness, compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensible to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community."<br><br>The charter was launched on November 12, 2009, in sixty different locations throughout the world; it was enshrined in synagogues, mosques, temples, and churches as well as in such secular institutions as the Karachi Press Club and the Sydney Opera House. But the work is only just beginning. At this writing, we have more than 150 partners working together throughout the globe to translate the charter into practical, realistic action.<br><br>But can compassion heal the seemingly intractable problems of our time? Is this virtue even feasible in the technological age? And what does &#x201c;compassion&#x201d; actually mean? Our English word is often confused with &#x201c;pity&#x201d; and associated with an uncritical, sentimental benevolence: the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, for example, defines &#x201c;compassionate&#x201d; as &#x201c;piteous&#x201d; or &#x201c;pitiable.&#x201d; This perception of compassion is not only widespread but ingrained. When I gave a lecture in the Netherlands recently, I emphatically made the point that compassion did <i>not</i> mean feeling sorry for people, but the Dutch translation of my text in the newspaper <i>De Volkskrant</i> consistently rendered &#x201c;compassion&#x201d; as &#x201c;pity.&#x201d; But &#x201c;compassion&#x201d; derives from the Latin <i>patiri </i>and the Greek <i>pathein</i>, meaning &#x201c;to suffer, undergo, or experience.&#x201d; So &#x201c;<i>com</i>passion&#x201d; means &#x201c;to endure [something] <i>with</i> another person,&#x201d; to put ourselves in somebody else&#x2019;s shoes, to feel her pain as though it were our own, and to enter generously into his point of view. That is why compassion is aptly summed up in the Golden Rule, which asks us to look into our own hearts, discover what gives us pain, and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else. Compassion can be defined, therefore, as an attitude of principled, consistent altruism.<br><br>The first person to formulate the Golden Rule, as far as we know, was the Chinese sage Confucius (551&#x2013;479 BCE), who when asked which of his teachings his disciples could practice &#x201c;all day and every day&#x201d; replied: &#x201c;Perhaps the saying about <i>shu</i> (&#x201c;consideration&#x201d;). Never do to others what you would not like them to do to you.&#x201d; This, he said, was the thread that ran right through the spiritual method he called the Way (<i>dao</i>) and pulled all its teachings together. &#x201c;Our Master&#x2019;s Way,&#x201d; explained one of his pupils, &#x201c;is nothing but this: doing-your-best-for-others (<i>zhong</i>) and consideration (<i>shu</i>).&#x201d; A better translation of <i>shu</i> is &#x201c;likening to oneself&#x201d;; people should not put themselves in a special, privileged category but relate their own experience to that of others &#x201c;all day and every day.&#x201d; Confucius called this ideal <i>ren</i>, a word that originally meant &#x201c;noble&#x201d; or &#x201c;worthy&#x201d; but which by his time simply meant &#x201c;human.&#x201d; Some scholars have argued that its root meaning was &#x201c;softness,&#x201d; &#x201c;pliability.&#x201d; But Confucius always refused to define <i>ren</i>, because, he said, it did not adequately correspond to any of the familiar categories of his day. It could be understood only by somebody who practiced it perfectly and was inconceivable to anybody who did not. A person who behaved with <i>ren</i> &#x201c;all day and every day&#x201d; would become a <i>junzi</i>, a &#x201c;mature human being.&#x201d;<br><br>Compassion, therefore, was inseparable from humanity; instead of being motivated by self-interest, a truly humane person was consistently oriented to others. The disciplined practice of <i>shu</i> took you into a dimension of experience that was transcendent because it went beyond the egotism that characterizes most human transactions. The Buddha (c. 470&#x2013;390 BCE) would have agreed. He claimed to have discovered a realm of sacred peace within himself that he called <i>nirvana</i> (&#x201c;blowing out&#x201d;), because the passions, desires, and selfishness that had hitherto held him in thrall had been extinguished like a flame. Nirvana, he claimed, was an entirely natural state and could be achieved by anybody who put his regimen into practice. One of its central disciplines was a meditation on four elements of the &#x201c;immeasurable&#x201d; love that exists within everyone and everything: <i>maitri</i> (&#x201c;loving kindness&#x201d;), the desire to bring happiness to all sentient beings; <i>karuna</i> (&#x201c;compassion&#x201d;), the resolve to liberate all creatures from their pain; <i>mudita</i> (&#x201c;sympathetic joy&#x201d;), which takes delight in the happiness of others; and finally <i>upeksha</i> (&#x201c;even-mindedness&#x201d;), an equanimity that enables us to love all beings equally and impartially.<br><br>These traditions, therefore, agree that compassion is natural to human beings, that it is the fulfillment of human nature, and that in calling us to set ego aside in a consistently empathetic consideration of others, it can introduce us to a dimension of existence that transcends our normal self-bound state. Later, as we shall see, the three monotheistic religions would arrive at similar conclusions, and the fact that this ideal surfaced in all these faiths independently suggests that it reflects something essential to the structure of our humanity.</p><h2>Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won&#39;t Save Black America</h2><p><b>A challenge to the cultural tradition of corporal punishment in Black homes and its connections to racial violence in America</b><br><br>Why do so many African Americans have such a special attachment to whupping children? Studies show that nearly 80 percent of black parents see spanking, popping, pinching, and beating as reasonable, effective ways to teach respect and to protect black children from the streets, incarceration, encounters with racism, or worse. However, the consequences of this widely accepted approach to child-rearing are far-reaching and seldom discussed. Dr. Stacey Patton&#x2019;s extensive research suggests that corporal punishment is a crucial factor in explaining why black folks are subject to disproportionately higher rates of school suspensions and expulsions, criminal prosecutions, improper mental health diagnoses, child abuse cases, and foster care placements, which too often funnel abused and traumatized children into the prison system.<br><br>Weaving together race, religion, history, popular culture, science, policing, psychology, and personal testimonies, Dr. Patton connects what happens at home to what happens in the streets in a way that is thought-provoking, unforgettable, and deeply sobering. <i>Spare the Kids</i> is not just a book. It is part of a growing national movement to provide positive, nonviolent discipline practices to those rearing, teaching, and caring for children of color.</p><p><b>Dr. Stacey Patton</b> is an adoptee, child abuse survivor, and former foster youth turned award-winning journalist, child advocate, and assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University. Dr. Patton was formerly a senior enterprise reporter with the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, where she covered graduate education, faculty life and research, and race and diversity issues. She writes frequently about race and child welfare issues for the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Al Jazeera</i>, <i>BBC News</i>, and The Root.com, and she is a weekly columnist for <i>DAME Magazine</i>. She has appeared on <i>Democracy Now</i>, <i>CBS News</i>, and programs on Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, and the BBC. Dr. Patton has won journalism awards from the National Association of Black Journalists, Scripps Howard Foundation, William Randolph Hearst Foundation, and the National Education Writers Association, and, in 2015, she was the recipient of the Vernon Jarrett Medal for Journalistic Excellence in reporting on race. In addition to her work as a journalist, Dr. Patton is the author of a memoir, <i>That Mean Old Yesterday</i>, published in 2008 by Simon &amp; Schuster. Dr. Patton also travels the United States delivering keynote addresses and conducting cultural competency trainings for child welfare and juvenile justice professionals. In 2016, she received an award from the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children for her service and advancement of cultural competency in child maltreatment prevention and intervention. Dr. Patton is also the creator of www.sparethekids.com, a web portal that offers education on child development issues and positive discipline techniques as alternatives to the physical punishment of children.&#x201c;The personal and generational damage Patton lays bare indicts a fearful culture of violence and implicates not only conceptions of good parenting among African Americans, but among Americans at large. This is a must-read for all concerned about the welfare of children, about America&#x2019;s future, and about the U.S. Constitution&#x2019;s pledge of &#x2018;We the People&#x2019; to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Spare the Kids</i> is a necessary book. Drawing from history, popular culture, and cutting edge research, Stacey Patton makes a careful and persuasive argument against the practice of hitting children. Without condescension or unnecessary moralizing, this book will challenge your most deeply held assumptions and refute your strongest arguments. More importantly, it challenges us to develop a healthier and more humane approach to raising and loving our children.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Marc Lamont Hill, author of <i>Nobody: Casualties of America&#x2019;s War on the Vulnerable, from Ferguson to Flint and Beyond</i><br><br>&#x201c;The impact on child-rearing among so many black families of Stacey Patton&#x2019;s <i>Spare the Kids</i> may well prove as powerfully corrective as Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2019;s <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i> was upon the acceptance of chattel slavery.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;David Levering Lewis, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner for biographies on W. E. B. Du Bois<br><br>&#x201c;Patton brilliantly demonstrates the ways that corporal punishment is indelibly linked to white supremacy, and a continuation of the systemic logic that undergirds it. In that sense, her work is less moralizing&#x2014;something we already have more than enough of&#x2014;than a structural analysis of systemic injustice and how that injustice has been transmitted directly, and often brutally, onto the bodies of children.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Tim Wise, author of <i>White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son</i><br><br>&#x201c;Patton&#x2019;s book is the most forceful case against corporal punishment ever made. Rooted in a deep understanding of the historical devaluation of black life, informed by the best science on trauma and violence exposure as predictors of future violence, and written in a fierce, urgent tone, if you turn these pages, you will stop beating your child. Ending the legacy of the master&#x2019;s lash in our schools and rejecting the preacher&#x2019;s admonition against sparing the rod in our homes may be the surest way for parents to show black children that their lives matter.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Khalil Muhammad, author of <i>The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern America</i> and professor at Harvard Kennedy School<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Spare the Kids</i> is a heartbreaking&#x2014;and important&#x2014;book that addresses the nightmarish reality that Black parents devoted to bringing up their children with love and respect may engage in punishment that hurts their families and reinforces ideas of white superiority and Black inferiority. Skillfully weaving together history, the experiences of Black families, the reports of researchers and the work of child advocates, Stacey Patton is leading a call for change that will transform childrearing forever.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jorja Leap, author of <i>Project Fatherhood: A Story of Courage and Healing in One of America&#x2019;s Toughest Communities</i><br><br>&#x201c;As a writer who had my daughter in my middle thirties and my son in my forties, I had thought a lot about how I wanted to raise them. I decided before they were born that I would not spank them. Stacey Patton&#x2019;s <i>Spare the Kids</i> confirmed my instinct that it couldn&#x2019;t be a way to build the kind of loving, trusting relationship I wanted to have with my kids. Being a parent is hard, no doubt. We make decisions all day, every day, small ones and big that impact our children&#x2019;s daily lives and ones that have long-range consequences. Patton&#x2019;s book reminds us that by respecting black children, their thoughts, their gifts, and their humanity, we show them that we love them.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Benilde Little, national best-selling author of <i>Good Hair</i>, <i>The Itch</i>, and <i>Welcome to My Breakdown</i><br><br>&#x201c;Stacey Patton&#x2019;s raw, searing and often disturbing examination peels back the layers of corporal punishment and exposes the deep and institutionalized wounds of our past, as well as the evidentiary tales of the present.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kuae Kelch Mattox, National President, Mocha Moms, Inc.</p><h2>Pancakes for Findus (Findus and Pettson)</h2><p><i>Pancakes for Findus</i> is the first story in the adventures of farmer Pettson and his cat Findus.

Kandel, the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his foundational research into memory storage in the brain, is one of the pioneers of modern brain science. His work continues to shape our understanding of how learning and memory work and to break down age-old barriers between the sciences and the arts.</p><p>In his seminal new book, <i>The Disordered Mind</i>, Kandel draws on a lifetime of pathbreaking research and the work of many other leading neuroscientists to take us on an unusual tour of the brain. He confronts one of the most difficult questions we face: How does our mind, our individual sense of self, emerge from the physical matter of the brain? The brain&#x2019;s 86 billion neurons communicate with one another through very precise connections. But sometimes those connections are disrupted. The brain processes that give rise to our mind can become disordered, resulting in diseases such as autism, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson&#x2019;s, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder. While these disruptions bring great suffering, they can also reveal the mysteries of how the brain produces our most fundamental experiences and capabilities&#x2015;the very nature of what it means to be human. Studies of autism illuminate the neurological foundations of our social instincts; research into depression offers important insights on emotions and the integrity of the self; and paradigm-shifting work on addiction has led to a new understanding of the relationship between pleasure and willpower.</p><p>By studying disruptions to typical brain functioning and exploring their potential treatments, we will deepen our understanding of thought, feeling, behavior, memory, and creativity. Only then can we grapple with the big question of how billions of neurons generate consciousness itself.</p></p><p><b>Eric R.

Iwamatsu was born September 21, 1908, in Nejima, Kimotsuki District, Kagoshima, and raised on the southern coast of Kyushu. His father was a country doctor who collected oriental art and encouraged his son to persue a career in art. After studying for three years at the Imperial Art Academy in Tokyo, Iwamatsu became a successful illustrator and cartoonist. At one point both he and his wife, Tomoe, went to jail for his opposition to the militaristic government. In 1939, they went to the United States to study art, leaving behind their son, Mako. After Pearl Harbor, Iwamatsu joined the US Army and went to work as an artist for the Office of Strategic Services. It was then that he first used the pseudonym Taro Yashima out of fear there would be repercussions for Mako and other family members if the Japanese government knew of his employment. He died in 1994."The anticipation, impatience, and joy of a little girl who waits for a rainy day to use her birthday umbrella are sensitively portrayed in a beautiful picture book." -<b>Booklist</b></p><h2>Inca Gold (Dirk Pitt Adventures)</h2><p>A classic, thrilling Dirk Pitt adventure from a master of the genre!<br><br>Nearly five centuries ago a fleet of boats landed mysteriously on an island in an inland sea.

Shadows ran like black water, filling up the the alleys first, then climbing steadily higher, a tide of darkness rising to drown the capital. Twilight&#x2019;s gloom spread over retail districts and medcenters, and crept like a dark stain up the walls of the Chancellor&#x2019;s residence as the sun slipped below the horizon. Soon only the rooftops were gilded with the day&#x2019;s last yellow light; then the shadows conquered them, too, swarming up the pinnacles of the Senate Building and the spires of the Jedi Temple. The long day of the Republic had come to an end.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dusk on Coruscant.<br> &nbsp;<br> On a moonless night a million standard years earlier, perhaps even before the rise of sentient beings, sunset would have meant darkness absolute, except for the distant burn of the stars. Not now. Even during galactic war, Coruscant was still the blazing heart of the greatest civilization in the history of the galaxy. As the sun retreated, the great city began to sparkle with innumerable lights. Speeders darted between tall towers like glow-flies dancing in meadows of transparisteel. Signs flared to life along every street, blinking bright promises at evening passersby. Lights came on in the windows of apartments and stores and offices.<br> &nbsp;<br> So life goes on despite the gathering dark, Senator Padm� Amidala thought, looking out her window. Each individual life burning bravely, like a candle raised against the night. She kept her eyes on the spaceport landing platform nearest to the Jedi Temple. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t a luxury,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> A handmaiden turned to look at her, puzzled. &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hope. It isn&#x2019;t a luxury. It&#x2019;s our duty,&#x201d; Padm� said.<br> &nbsp;<br> The handmaiden started to stammer a reply, but Padm� cut her off. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s landing,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> A ship settled like a dragonfly on the landing platform nearest to the Temple, lights burning at its tail and wingtips. Padm� grabbed for a pair of macrobinoculars and tabbed the night-vision settings, trying to read the designation on the courier&#x2019;s battle-scarred side. Searching the hooded figure climbing from the cockpit.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;M&#x2019;lady?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Slowly Padm� put the macrobinoculars aside. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not him,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chief Technician Boz Addle loved all the ships in his care, but he had a special affection for the sleek couriers. He ran a gloved hand along the metal flank of the Hoersch-Kessel Seltaya-class fast courier Limit of Vision that had just come home. &#x201c;Electrical sparking, meteorite pocking, a couple of laser cannon burns,&#x201d; he murmured. His hand paused over a nasty gash where part of the ship&#x2019;s protective laminate had boiled away, showing a mass of fused wiring studded with shrapnel. &#x201c;And unless I miss my guess, you took a few proton hits to boot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jedi Master Jai Maruk clambered out of the cockpit. His face was gaunt, stitched with shrapnel cuts, and puckered by a bad burn that lay in a bar of charred flesh across his cheek. Half healed on the frantic trip home, the burned skin had bubbled and turned stiff, pulling up one corner of his mouth. The chief technician regarded him gravely. &#x201c;You promised you&#x2019;d bring my ship back without a scratch, Master Maruk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grim smile. &#x201c;I lied.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The duty medic bustled forward. &#x201c;Let me check you out.&#x201d; He paused, squinting more closely at the slashing burn mark on the Jedi&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;Master Maruk! What&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time for that now. I must speak to the Jedi Council at once&#x2014;as many as can be found, anyway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But Master Maruk&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Jedi waved him off. &#x201c;Forgive me, medic, but now is not the time. I have a message to deliver that cannot wait, and I have been left, very much on purpose, in good enough shape to deliver it.&#x201d; Again the grim smile. He strode away, pausing only at the docking bay doors. &#x201c;Chief Boz,&#x201d; he said more gently.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Master?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry about the ship.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The medic and the chief technician stood side by side on the landing platform and watched him leave. &#x201c;Lightsaber burns?&#x201d; Boz asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> The medic nodded, wide-eyed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The chief tech spat thoughtfully on the deck. &#x201c;Thought so.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Clone Wars like a mighty hand had flung Jedi throughout the stars, leaving only a few senior Jedi Knights in the Temple at any time. Yoda, of course, as Master of the Order and military adviser to the Chancellor, was nearly always on Coruscant. Tonight only two others had joined him to hear Jai Maruk&#x2019;s story: Jai Maruk&#x2019;s close friend Master Ilena Xan, nicknamed Iron Hand by the students&#x2014;she taught hand-to-hand combat, and her specialty was joint locks&#x2014;and Jedi Council member Mace Windu, who was too intimidating for nicknames.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We were running recon in the Outer Rim,&#x201d; Jai said. &#x201c;Began to think there was something funny going on in the neighborhood of the Hydian Way. Little drab transports kept popping up, like a mermyn-trail leading into and out of the Wayland region. Nothing so unusual about that, the Trade Federation has the whole region locked down&nbsp;...&nbsp;but these were popping in from strange coordinates. Deep-space vectors, not local traffic. I got a funny feeling about them, so I dressed up one of the clone transports in pirate&#x2019;s colors and sent it to intercept. Turned out that little commercial shuttle had legs on it like a Neimoidian jakrab. Dropped down a burst of plasma fire and jumped to hyperspace in a heartbeat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Master Yoda&#x2019;s wrinkled brow rose. &#x201c;In a nerf&#x2019;s coat, this krayt dragon was.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; Master Jai Maruk glanced down at his right hand, which was trembling. An ugly char mark was burned across his palm. He regarded the hand steadily. The trembling stopped.<br> &nbsp;<br> A young Padawan, a red-haired girl of perhaps fourteen, came into the room with a pitcher of water and some glasses on a tray. Bowing, she placed them on a low table. Master Xan poured a tumbler of water and gave it to Jai. He stared at the glassy, oozing skin on the palm of his burned hand, forced it to curl around the tumbler, and drank.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So the Trade Federation was shipping something important into the Hydian Way,&#x201d; Jai continued. &#x201c;Why? Not new ordnance; we don&#x2019;t have any significant troop concentrations out there. And why the disguise? They could wear their fleet colors proudly&#x2014;it would scare off any pirates or casual raiders, like my poor clone troopers had pretended to be.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There has to be something there we aren&#x2019;t supposed to know about,&#x201d; Ilena said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mace Windu studied the lightsaber burns on Jai Maruk&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;Or someone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yoda tapped out a pattern on the Council Chamber floor with his cane. &#x201c;One of these krayts, followed it did you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But you were caught,&#x201d; Mace said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jai&#x2019;s face tightened. &#x201c;I tracked them to a rendezvous on Vjun.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Master Yoda stirred and shook his head. The others looked to him. &#x201c;Strong in the dark side, Vjun is,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;Know you the stories?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They looked at him blankly.<br> &nbsp;<br> The corners of Yoda&#x2019;s mouth turned down. &#x201c;A trial of being old is this: remembering which thing one has said into which young ears. But he knows; I remember we spoke of it when he was only a Padawan&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The other Jedi stared. &#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d; Master Xan asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yoda waved the question off with his stick. &#x201c;It matters not. Master Maruk, continue.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jai took another sip of water. &#x201c;At first I remained sunside, hidden from my krayt, but when it stayed dirtside for longer than just refueling, I had to risk following it to the surface. I made a soft landing many kilometers away, I kept my heat and IR signatures crushed down, I swear it&#x2014;&#x201d; He slowed to a stop. His hand was trembling again. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. She caught me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She?&#x201d; Master Xan asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Asajj Ventress.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A gasp came from the Padawan who had brought the water. Yoda glanced over, furrowing his face into a mass of stern wrinkles. Only those who knew him very well could have detected the light of amusement in his eye. &#x201c;Little pitchers, big ears they have! Duties to attend to, have you not, Scout?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve finished dinner, and there&#x2019;s nothing urgent I have to do before tomorrow. I mean, I was intending to practice in the training room, but that could&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl flushed and stuttered to a halt under the massed gaze of the Jedi Masters. &#x201c;Padawan Scout,&#x201d; Mace Windu said deliberately, &#x201c;I am surprised to hear you have this much free time, given the upcoming Apprentice Tournament. I hate to think you might be bored. Would you like me to find you something to do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The girl gulped. &#x201c;No, Master. Not necessary. As you say&#x2014;practice&#x2014;I should&nbsp;...&#x201d; She bowed and backed out of the room, sliding the door almost shut, until they could see only one green eye. &#x201c;But if there&#x2019;s anything else you need, don&#x2019;t hesitate to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Scout!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right!&#x201d; And with a click the door slid shut.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mace Windu shook his head. &#x201c;The Force is weak in that one. I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Master Xan held up her hand, and Mace fell silent. Xan&#x2019;s fingers truly were like iron, sheathed with muscle, the joints knotted from years of hand-to-hand combat training. She flicked her hand at the door in a gentle Force push. The door thunked and they heard a muffled yelp. A moment later, embarrassed footsteps pattered away down the corridor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mace Windu shook his head impatiently. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what Chankar saw in her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll never know now,&#x201d; Jai Maruk said. Together they paused in remembrance of Chankar Kim, another Jedi fallen in the ring at Geonosis. At first, there had been ceremonies and vigils memorializing that horrible slaughter. But time and the war had gone on, and the Temple was now bleeding from more than that one great wound. Every week or two, another report would come in of a comrade lost in a battle on Thustra, or blown up in high space over Wayland, or assassinated in a diplomatic mission to Devaron.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Frankly,&#x201d; Mace said, &#x201c;I was surprised she was ever chosen to be a Padawan.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The tip of Yoda&#x2019;s cane swirled slowly over the chamber floor, as if he were stirring the depths of a pond visible only to him. &#x201c;To the Agricultural Corps she should be sent, think you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Actually, yes, I do.&#x201d; A note of sympathy entered Mace Windu&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;There is no dishonor in that. When you see how hard she has to fight just to keep up with children years younger than she is&nbsp;...&nbsp;Perhaps it would be kinder to let her work at her own level.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Yoda cocked his head and looked curiously at him. &#x201c;See her struggle do I, as well. But if you make her stop, tell you it is &#x2018;kind,&#x2019; she will not!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe not,&#x201d; Jai Maruk said grimly. &#x201c;But children do not always want what is best for them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nor do Jedi Masters,&#x201d; Yoda said dryly.<br> &nbsp;<br> The burned Jedi forged on. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s be honest. Not every pairing of Jedi Knight and Padawan will be Obi-Wan and Anakin, granted, but the truth is we are at war. To send a Jedi into battle with a Padawan who cannot be trusted to hold her own is to needlessly risk two lives&#x2014;lives the Republic cannot afford to throw away.&#x201d;</p><h2>Reclaiming Glory: Revitalizing Dying Churches</h2><p>What is there about a dying church that brings glory to God? Mark Clifton's convicting answer is "Nothing."<br><br> Because a local church is intended to represent the work of God in a community, when that church "loses it saltiness," not only is God's work pictured as irrelevant in that community, but also dishonor and disrepute may well become associated with God's name as a result.<br><br> In <i>Reclaiming Glory</i>, Clifton draws not only upon his own burden for revitalizing dying churches but also upon years of church replanting experience to offer passionate counsel for how to breathe new life into a dying church . . . all for the glory of the God who is building his church upon the immovable rock of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p><b>Mark Clifton</b> is Lead National Strategist for Revitalization/Replanting at the North American Mission Board.

With humor and simple illustrations, theology professor John Bergsma focuses on Matthew, Luke, Paul, and John, whose writings comprise about 90 percent of the New Testament. The gospel of Matthew, written for Jewish Christians, illuminates the life and teachings of Christ as the long-promised Messiah. In Luke's gospel, readers will delve into the infancy and Triduum narratives, as well as the Acts of the Apostles and the life of the early Church. This leads the reader to discover St. Paul and his first and arguably greatest theological treatise: Romans.

It is believed that we must commit 10,000 hours to master a skill.&nbsp; According to Lieberman, each of us has spent 10,000 hours learning to make sense of people and groups <i>by the time we are ten</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Social</i> argues that our need to reach out to and connect with others is a primary driver behind our behavior.&nbsp; We believe that pain and pleasure alone guide our actions.&nbsp; Yet, new research using fMRI--including a great deal of original research conducted by Lieberman and his UCLA lab--shows that our brains react to social pain and pleasure in much the same way as they do to physical pain and pleasure.&nbsp; Fortunately, the brain has evolved sophisticated mechanisms for securing our place in the social world.&nbsp; We have a unique ability to read other people&#x2019;s minds, to figure out their hopes, fears, and motivations, allowing us to effectively coordinate our lives with one another.&nbsp; And our most private sense of who we are is intimately linked to the important people and groups in our lives.&nbsp; This wiring often leads us to restrain our selfish impulses for the greater good.&nbsp; These mechanisms lead to behavior that might seem irrational, but is really just the result of our deep social wiring and necessary for our success as a species.<br> &nbsp;<br> Based on the latest cutting edge research, the findings in <i>Social</i> have important real-world implications.&nbsp; Our schools and businesses, for example, attempt to minimalize social distractions.&nbsp; But this is exactly the wrong thing to do to encourage engagement and learning, and literally shuts down the social brain, leaving powerful neuro-cognitive resources untapped.&nbsp; The insights revealed in this pioneering book suggest ways to improve learning in schools, make the workplace more productive, and improve our overall well-being.</p><p><b><b>Matthew D.

With the details from study after study, many of them based on imaging scans that examine activity in certain parts of the brain, Lieberman&#x2019;s book is perfect for Malcolm Gladwell fans who want to delve much deeper into the biology behind our social abilities.

Although the origins of the early Jedi remain mysterious, ancient texts indicate that they not only shared abilities to manipulate the energy field we call the Force, but were also compelled to use their powers selflessly to help others. This practice became a key foundation of the Jedi Order.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, as long as there have been Jedi, there have been those who have been tempted to use the Force for selfish and even nefarious purposes; Jedi drawn into the negative side of the Force known as the dark side became referred to as Dark Jedi. Approximately seven thousand years ago, a conflict between Jedi and Dark Jedi led to the latter fleeing to the far reaches of space. Shortly afterward, a few of these Dark Jedi&#x2014;known as the Exiles&#x2014;managed to return to Republic space in an attempt to destroy the Jedi. The effort failed, and the Jedi learned that the surviving Exiles had conquered the people of the Sith system and proclaimed themselves Sith Lords.<br> &nbsp;<br> For nearly two thousand years, the location of the Sith system remained unknown to the Jedi, while the Sith Lords were unable to find their way back to Republic space. The Sith&#x2019;s eventual return initiated what became known as the Great Hyperspace War. It was during a subsequent conflict&#x2014;the Sith War, which occurred more than four thousand years ago&#x2014;that the Sith triggered the explosion of ten suns, causing a shock wave that ravaged the original Jedi Temple and the Great Jedi Library on Ossus. Research has revealed that the Jedi rescued only a fraction of the materials from the Great Jedi Library, and that these items were brought to Exis Station before they were eventually transferred to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, all was not lost on Ossus, as the planet&#x2019;s remote location, dry atmosphere, and native Ysanna&#x2014;descendants of the Jedi who remained on Ossus after the cataclysmic disaster&#x2014;helped preserve many ancient scrolls and books that remained in the ruins of the library. These texts, along with all known Jedi-related data that survived the Clone Wars, are now held at the new Jedi library on Ossus.<br> &nbsp;<br> Contemporary Jedi also have two very unusual resources on the history of the Sith: The Lundi Series, recorded lectures of Professor Murk Lundi, who was by most accounts a better teacher than researcher; and the Wavlud Manuscript, which was recovered from the personal effects of Ingo Wavlud, a suspected Sith sympathizer from the world of Byss. Although The Lundi Series frequently fails to cite specific sources and some data appears to have been invented by Lundi to boost his academic reputation, the heavily annotated Wavlud Manuscript not only corroborates many of Lundi&#x2019;s findings but also provides previously unknown information regarding the Darth title and the Sith Lord Darth Sidious.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE HOLOCRONS<br> &nbsp;<br> The most precious and significant sources of Jedi history are held in Jedi Holocrons. Both compact repositories of knowledge and interactive learning devices, Holocrons employ patterns of organic crystals and hologrammic technology to simulate conversation with long-dead Jedi &#x201c;gatekeepers,&#x201d; whose teachings infuse particular Holocrons. With few exceptions, Jedi Holocrons are cubes that can easily be held in one&#x2019;s hand. Evidently, Holocrons are partially powered by the Force, as only Force-users can activate them; once activated, anyone&#x2014;even non-Force-users&#x2014;can communicate with the gatekeepers. However, not all data is readily accessible, because Holocrons are engineered to detect students&#x2019; abilities in order to hold back elements they are not prepared to know.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to the exotic Holocrons, Jedi utilized standard data tapes for some educational aspects. Data tapes lack the archival qualities of books, scrolls, and Holocrons, but it is most fortunate that some have survived, as they&#x2019;ve provided many details about the training of Jedi during the Old Republic era. Nearly all of the existing tapes were recovered from a single source: the wreck of the Chu&#x2019;unthor, a mobile training academy for groups of Jedi apprentices, which crashed more than three centuries ago on Dathomir.<br> &nbsp;<br> Records also indicate that the Jedi Archives on Coruscant once held a collection of Sith Holocrons, most of which were pyramidical and&#x2014;because they housed information that was dangerous in the wrong hands&#x2014;off limits to the majority of Jedi. Like Jedi Holocrons, Sith Holocrons implement restrictive mechanisms to detect whether a student is prepared to receive certain knowledge. The Sith&#x2019;s hologrammic simulacra can exert only verbal influence, but allegedly attempted to corrupt otherwise innocent beings and draw &#x201c;students&#x201d; down the path to the dark side. The Jedi Order&#x2019;s earliest known awareness of Sith Holocrons dates back to the end of the Great Hyperspace War, when one was recovered from an abandoned Sith ship by the Jedi Odan-Urr. Odan-Urr kept this Sith Holocron for nearly a millennium before it was stolen by the Jedi Exar Kun, who used it to learn many secrets of the Sith. It is also highly probable that at least one Jedi with the knowledge of Holocron construction was among the Exiles who proclaimed themselves the first Sith Lords.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although the Jedi once regarded Sith Holocrons as tools and not evil entities, the devices are embodiments of temptation to those who hope to achieve power by way of arcane knowledge. During the Clone Wars, the former Jedi Count Dooku&#x2014;at the time, one of only twenty Jedi Masters known to have renounced the Jedi Order&#x2014;stole at least one Sith Holocron from the Archives on Coruscant and also acquired the Sith Holocron of Darth Andeddu. Like Exar Kun, Count Dooku became a Sith Lord; while it is conceivable that the respective experiences and personality traits of both individuals guided their paths to the dark side, the possession of Sith Holocrons certainly directed their courses as well. Records do not reveal the fate of the Sith Holocrons used by Exar Kun and Count Dooku.<br> &nbsp;<br> Various databases and eyewitnesses testify that the Jedi Archives on Coruscant held scores of Jedi Holocrons. Unfortunately, the ancient technology of the Holocrons, as well as the majority of the devices themselves, may be lost to time. Because Holocrons have been such a significant resource in the creation of this record, descriptions of noteworthy Holocrons precede a detailed time line of events in Jedi and Sith history.</p><h2>The Weaver&#39;s Companion (The Companion Series)</h2><p>All the basics of weaving are provided in this succinct handbook.

It's one man's story of a dangerous world&#x2014;and how to stay alive in it. </p></p><p><b>Book Description</b><p> Terrorist attacks. Natural disasters. Domestic crackdowns. Economic collapse. Riots. Wars. Disease. Starvation. </p> <p> What can you do when it all hits the fan? </p> <p> You can learn to be self-sufficient and survive without the system. </p> <p> **I've started to look at the world through apocalypse eyes.** So begins Neil Strauss's harrowing new book: his first full-length worksince the international bestseller <i>The Game</i>, and one of the most original-and provocative-narratives of the year. </p> <p> After the last few years of violence and terror, of ethnic and religious hatred, of tsunamis and hurricanes&#x2013;and now of world financial meltdown&#x2013;Strauss, like most of his generation, came to the sobering realization that, even in America, anything can happen. But rather than watch helplessly, he decided to do something about it. And so he spent three years traveling through a country that's lost its sense of safety, equipping himself with the tools necessary to save himself and his loved ones from an uncertain future. </p> <p>With the same quick wit and eye for cultural trends that marked <i>The Game, The Dirt,</i> and <i>How to Make Love Like a Porn Star, Emergency</i> traces Neil's white-knuckled journey through today's heart of darkness, as he sets out to move his life offshore, test his skills in the wild, and remake himself as a gun-toting, plane-flying, government-defying survivor. It's a tale of paranoid fantasies and crippling doubts, of shady lawyers and dangerous cult leaders, of billionaire gun nuts and survivalist superheroes, of weirdos, heroes, and ordinary citizens going off the grid. </p> <p>It's one man's story of a dangerous world&#x2013;and how to stay alive in it. </p> <p>Before the next disaster strikes, you're going to want to read this book. And you'll want to do everything it suggests. Because tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee... </p> <p> <strong>Questions for Neil Strauss</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What initially inspired you to write <i>Emergency</i>? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> It happened over the last eight years, watching as everything that we thought could never happen in America suddenly started happening. So I decided to take control over my own life, rather than being dependent on an increasingly undependable system, and worked toward becoming as self-sufficient, independent, skilled, and experienced as I could. That journey continues today. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You use the term "Fliesian" in the book (as in <i>Lord of the Flies</i>). What is a Fliesian? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> Someone who believes that people, if put in a world where there are no consequences to their actions, will do horrible things. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> So how can we hold on to our kindness and humaneness in a crisis? </p><p><strong>Strauss:</strong> Fortunately, in my experience, it is precisely these situations when you see the best in people come out. The worst in some tends to arise only when the resources one needs to survive are scarce and there is competition for them. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Do you think that this book is catering to a fear-based culture? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> Actually, the book is less about spreading fears than getting over them. What most of us fear is the unknown, and we fret about what&#x2019;s going to happen in an uncertain future when we consider the calamities of the past. I decided to no longer react to the things I read in newspapers, but instead to understand them. So I took each worst-case scenario to the extreme, and experienced many of the things that used to make me anxious. I guess, in that way, it was like a more interesting, adventurous Prozac. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> A lot of writers these days are basing books on various year-long stunts: read the encyclopedia for a year, always say "yes" for a year, have sex with your wife every day for a year. But your brand of immersion journalism, in <i>Emergency</i> and in <i>The Game</i>, is more open-ended--and more personal--than that. Do you draw any sort of line between the books and your life? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> My books never begin as books. They usually begin as some sort of lack I recognize in my life and try to fix with the help of the most qualified experts I can find. Often, these people are not in the public eye, but hidden in a splinter subculture. And while I&#x2019;m trying to get taken under their wing, I realize at some point I&#x2019;m spending so much time trying to learn and improve that I might as well have something to show for it, so I write a book.</p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> One of the first subcultures you embedded yourself in was a cabal of billionaires. Are wealthy people safer than the rest of us? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> No, they&#x2019;re more scared than the rest of us. That&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re taking so many precautionary measures. They are defined by their money, and now that identity is crumbling around them. You can&#x2019;t buy safety. Those who are the most safe are the ones with knowledge, skills, and experience. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You describe the philosophy of the sphincter in <i>Emergency</i>. What is that? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> I learned that from one of my defense instructors. The basic idea is that, in a high-pressure situation, the first thing that happens is people get nervous and uptight. And as soon as your sphincter tightens, as the metaphor goes, it cuts off circulation to your brain. So one of the best survival skills you can have is the ability to quickly and coolly assess a situation rather than panicking and doing something stupid. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> From your wilderness survival training, it sounds like you're in pretty good shape if things ever hit the fan. But what if you live in the city? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> That&#x2019;s a good point. A lot of the wilderness survival skills I learned don&#x2019;t take into account that, in America today, there&#x2019;s little actual wilderness left. So I took a class called Urban Escape and Evasion. As the teacher put it, &#x201c;Once you learn lockpicking, the world is your oyster.&#x201d; He also taught car hot-wiring, evading pursuit vehicles, and, as an exam, handcuffed me, put me in a trunk, and told me I had to escape. It was one of the most interesting classes I&#x2019;d taken in my life. If I&#x2019;d known these skills in high school, I definitely would have been expelled. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The book has a surprising trajectory--surprising to the reader and I think to you as well. You start out looking for a way to get out of Dodge if one of many possible disasters strikes, but as you develop your survival skills, instead of becoming a lone wolf in the woods, you start becoming tied to your community, as an EMT and a trained crisis management worker (not to mention a goat midwife). It's actually pretty heartwarming. Did you see any of that coming? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> Definitely not. I had no idea that when disasters happen now, instead of running away from them, I&#x2019;d be running toward them and trying to be of some use to the community. I think that, if there&#x2019;s a silver lining in the dark cloud that is the economy right now, it&#x2019;s that hard times bring people closer together. Now is the time to get to know your neighbors. You never know when you may need them. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Has your experience writing <i>Emergency</i> affected you differently from your experience writing <i>The Game</i>? </p><p> <strong>Strauss:</strong> Yes, because now, at 3 a.m. on a Saturday night, my search-and-rescue pager will go off and I&#x2019;ll have to stop doing what I learned in <i>The Game</i> and start doing what I learned in <i>Emergency</i>. </p><p>Neil Strauss is the author of the<em> New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Game, Rules of the Game, Emergency,</em> and<em> Everyone Loves You When You&#x2019;re Dead</em>.

Region by region, he describes each oyster's appearance, flavor, origin, and availability, as well as explaining how oysters grow, how to shuck them without losing a finger, how to pair them with wine (not to mention beer), and why they're one of the few farmed seafoods that are good for the earth as well as good for you. Packed with fabulous recipes, maps, and photos, plus lists of top oyster restaurants, producers, and festivals, <i>A Geography of Oysters </i>is both delightful reading and the guide that oyster lovers of all kinds have been waiting for.</p></p><p><b>Rowan Jacobsen</b> is the managing editor of <i>The Art of Eating</i> and a frequent contributor to the magazine, for which he has written on subjects including wasabi, umami, lobsters, and mead. He is also the author of <i>Chocolate Unwrapped. </i>He grew up eating oysters in the steamy backwaters of rural Florida and now lives in the hills of Vermont with his wife and son.<i>Starred Review.</i> Jacobsen, managing editor of the magazine <i>The Art of Eating</i>, presents the ultimate macropedia for oysters, covering not just geography, but also philosophy, consumerism, epicurean splendor and the proper way to grow a pearl. The first of the guide's three sections, Mastering Oysters, covers such cocktail party talking points as A Dozen Oysters You Should Know and The Aphrodisiac Angle, and presents a primer on how and why oysters taste as they do. Chapter two accounts for half the book's page count and is a travelogue across the Maritime Provinces of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, a movable feast up and down the east and west coasts of North America. Jacobsen ends his research with Everything You Wanted to Know About Oysters but Were Afraid to Ask. (The title exemplifies one of the very few times that his writing goes stale). Here he lists the best ways to ship, store and shuck, and explains why it is perfectly all right to eat oysters in months that do not have an r in them. He also serves up 20 or so recipes, including Coconut Oyster Stew with ginger and lemongrass and Baked Oysters in Tarragon Butter, simple to make but complex in flavor. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Pleasing acrylic paintings lift the pedestrian text from adequate to engaging. With six "this" and three "these" totally dependent on the pictures, it is fortunate that the selective realism of Gaber's acrylic paintings is up to the task. In addition, effective use is made of the double-page, full-page, and spot formats. Author and illustrator notes explain the choice of Indian in the text and elaborate on the first celebration of this holiday. (Though the author states that it "lasted three days" in her notes, it is only the "very first" day that she addresses.)

Now, see for yourself why this extraordinary novel has galvanized the literary and mystery community as no other book before it....</p><p>Other than the bullet lodged near his heart, former Detroit cop Alex McKnight thought he had put the nightmare of his partner's death and his own near-fatal injury behind him. After all, the man convicted of the crimes has been locked away for years. But in the small town of Paradise, Michigan, where McKnight has traded his badge for a cabin in the woods, a murderer with the same unmistakable trademarks appears to be back. McKnight can't understand who else would know the intimate details of the old murders. And it seems like it'll be a frozen day in Hell before McKnight can unravel truth from deception in a town that's anything but Paradise.</p></p><p>Doing their best to ensure the future of the genre, St. Martin's Press and the Private Eye Writers of America give out an award every year for the Best First Private Eye Novel. The 1997 winner was this splendidly evocative work by IBM employee Steve Hamilton, which takes just about every clich� in the field and turns it inside out. Yes, Alex McKnight was an athlete in his youth--but a minor league baseball player, not a top pro forced out by injury. And yes, he was a cop in Detroit before he moved up to the town of Paradise on the shores of Lake Superior--but even this overused genre icon is made believable by the details of a particularly bloody shootout. In Paradise, Alex runs a hunting camp built by his late father and only drifts into private investigations because of two friends, a persuasive lawyer and a local millionaire with a gambling problem who needs his help. When two bookmakers are murdered and the millionaire disappears, all the signs point to the psychopath who killed McKnight's partner and left a slug near Alex's heart 14 years before. The only problem is that this man has definitely, positively been in prison ever since. You might figure out the plot twists a page or two before McKnight does, but don't bet the farm on it. And the deep layer of details that Hamilton provides about life in this bleak part of the world add to the book's many pleasures. <i>--Dick Adler</i>"Ingenious...Hamilton unreels the mystery with a mounting tension many an old pro might envy." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><p> "Hamilton combines crisp, clear writing, wily colorful characters and an offbeat locale in an impressive debut." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p> "Chilling as the November wind.

Walker&#x2019;s work is a corrective biography, intended to dispel the many myths and legends that continue to surround Chopin. <i>Fryderyk Chopin</i> is an intimate look into a dramatic life; of particular focus are Chopin&#x2019;s childhood and youth in Poland, which are brought into line with the latest scholarly findings, and Chopin&#x2019;s romantic life with George Sand, with whom he lived for nine years.</p><p>Comprehensive and engaging, and written in highly readable prose, the biography wears its scholarship lightly: this is a book suited as much for the professional pianist as it is for the casual music lover. Just as he did in his definitive biography of Liszt, Walker illuminates Chopin and his music with unprecedented clarity in this magisterial biography, bringing to life one of the nineteenth century&#x2019;s most confounding, beloved, and legendary artists.</p></p><p><b>Alan Walker</b>&#x2019;s definitive three-volume biography of Liszt, <i>Franz Liszt</i>,<i> </i>received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in Biography and the Royal Philharmonic Society Book Award, among others.

Alan Walker does so brilliantly in <i>Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times</i>, a magisterial portrait . . . A polyphonic work that elegantly interweaves multiple strands." --<b>Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>"An ideal composer biography should combine several qualities: a deep knowledge of the artist&#x2019;s life and milieu, fortified by a reexamination of all available sources; an intimate understanding of the composer&#x2019;s personality (and, when possible, some affection for it, too); and an ability to speak of the creative work in a manner that will edify both scholars and the general public, and take us all back to the music. Alan Walker&#x2019;s <i>Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times </i>manages this hat trick very well indeed . . . This is now the best biography of Chopin &#x2015; meticulous, scholarly and well-told." --<b>Tim Page, <i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p>"There is more than enough for everyone at this literary feast, and come awards time, it&#x2019;s likely you&#x2019;ll see this book short-listed for one of the top literary biographies of the year . . . Walker&#x2019;s narrative style reflects the very music of his subject: He has a light, delicate touch when making apt inferences, and a soft and rather ornate style when providing descriptions of the artist . . . Walker remains faithful to his subject, which only 10 years of extensive research into vast archives of primary source material could manifest." <b>--Richard Horan, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i></b></p><p>"At last, the definitive biography of Chopin has arrived. This substantial new study is a masterpiece, indispensable to specialists and general music lovers alike. It overflows with revelatory information, deft characterisation and pertinent, readable explorations of the music. All this is set against a minutely detailed depiction of his world. Walker&#x2019;s style is elegant, literary and empathetic, while his unfailing love for the music shines from every page." --<b><i>Sunday Times </i>(U.K.)</b></p><p>"Thorough and authoritative . . . Walker [writes] with the narrative expertise one would expect of the masterly biographer of Liszt . . . Walker is brilliant on piano technique and its musical consequences.

Walker integrates [many] different aspects into an entirely convincing entity. It's a measure of Walker's achievement that even in such a lengthy book, he keeps the reader engaged, presenting accessible and illuminating comments backed up with the full weight of scholarly authority." --<b>Erik Levi, <i>BBC Music</i> (five stars)</b></p><p>"[Alan Walker has] shed new light on many aspects of Chopin's life and cleared away a thicket of myths . . .

For the 'casual' music-lover it contains peerless writing; for the scholar, scotched myths and startling discoveries; and for the musician, insights galore . . . Walker leaves no stone unturned in his search for the truth about Chopin's life. Full of vivid detail, it is a perceptive chronicle through which one seems to live the composer's life alongside him . . . [<i>Fryderyk Chopin</i>] is the most important biography of Chopin in years and will be treasured by musicians and music-lovers as the definitive life for many more." --<b>Jessica Duchen, <i>Sunday Times </i>(U.K.)</b></p><p>"Alan Walker has produced the most comprehensive biography and musical analysis to date on Poland's most famous musician and composer . . .

Walker vividly recounts Chopin&#x2019;s happy childhood and youth in Warsaw, his unfortunate but artistically prolific adult life in exile from his native country, his loves, and his losing battle with the tuberculosis that killed him at the age of thirty-nine. The book also delves deeply into Chopin&#x2019;s music.

To satisfy those of you who desire to have a 1937 unedited copy, we have reproduced Napoleon Hill&#x2019;s personal copy of the first edition, printed in March of 1937. The book has the notation, &#x201c;not to be loaned,&#x201d; and signed: Annie Lou Hill (the wife of Dr. Hill). This personal copy of Dr. Hill&#x2019;s was given to me by Dr. Charles W. Johnson, Chairman of the Napoleon Hill Foundation and a nephew of Napoleon Hill. It was Napoleon Hill who sent Dr. Johnson to medical school, and today he is a practicing cardiologist. Charlie refers to Napoleon Hill as &#x201c;Uncle Nap&#x201d; and will often makes the statement, &#x201c;Uncle Nap would be proud of the Foundation today.&#x201d; The original 1937 manuscript was written and edited with the assistance of Napoleon&#x2019;s wife. In later years, the existing document was again edited by Dr. Hill. For example, the Foundation owns a 1958 edition that Hill edited personally. This did not lessen the book&#x2019;s value in Hill&#x2019;s judgment. Hill made the editing remarks in his own handwriting and the resulting 1960 edited edition has sold over 100 million copies making it the most read self-help book of all time. Today there are many so called authors who publish Think and Grow Rich and some even add their name alongside Dr. Hill&#x2019;s. I believe that these &#x201c;authors&#x201d; should be able to write something themselves instead of merely copying the work of Napoleon Hill. Who do they think they are kidding? Dr. Hill&#x2019;s works are highly recognizable and have had long lasting influence worldwide. In fact, Think and Grow Rich sells more copies today than before Dr. Hill died in 1970. Now you can purchase the original Foundation authorized 1937 unedited copy of Think and Grow Rich by visiting the Napoleon Hill Foundation&#x2019;s website, www.naphill.org. You will be supporting the nonprofit Napoleon Hill Foundation if you do this. For your convenience it is also available as an e-book. The entire philosophy of Napoleon Hill is based on the Golden Rule. The Foundation deeply appreciates the support of those of you who only purchase Napoleon Hill authorized books.

Enthusiastic members of a skeleton band cavort across the pages, strumming guitars, blowing hoRNs and otherwise helping to establish a spirited tone while imparting bits of relevant information. Each line from the song is given its own spread; text blocks set into the illustrations give related facts. For the lyric "Leg bone connected to da knee bone," for example, readers learn that the knee joint "works like a hinge," enabling one to "kick, jump, squat, and dance." The particular bone in question is always high-lighted in red on the skeleton, leaving no room for doubt. Splashed across a series of bright backdrops (Halloween colors predominate), Barner's (Bennys Pennies) cut and torn-paper collages are geared for tickling the funny bones of the early elementary set. Just about the only thing lacking here is the musical notation for a sing-along. No bones about it, this will be a real boost for those looking to inject a little humor and fun into basic facts about the human body. Ages 2-8.<br> </p><p> --<i>CHILD,</i> October 1996<br> This cast of frolicking skeletons is sure to tickle any kid's funny bone. Plus, readers will learn some anatomical facts, like how many bones we're born with (450).<br> </p><p>--<i>CHILDREN'S BOOK REVIEW SERVICE,</i> October 1996<br> Barner uses the African-American song "Dem Bones" to take children on an insightful journey through the human body. Children will be able to sing along to the familiar tune (and perhaps even act it out). A perfect real-aloud for its use of the song and because of the large, vivid collage illustrations.<br> </p><p>--<i>SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL,</i> November 1996 <br> Descriptions of skeletal structures are interspersed with the words of the traditional African American spiritual "Dem Bones." Leg bones, ankle bones, and neck bones are described in medical terminology and their structures are explained in simple terms for young readers. Subtle humor is helpful in explaining some of the concepts ("The skull is like a box that grows."). The colorful paper collage illustrations add humor and feature dancing, smiling skeletons playing instruments in accompaniment to the lyrics. This could be enjoyed as a picture book, using just the lyrics, but it works just as well as easy nonfiction.<br> </p><p>--<i>FAMILY LIFE,</i> November 1996 <br> You remember the old spiritual, the one that goes something like, "The toe bone's connected to the foot bone, Foot bone's connected to the ankebone...." Barner has connected the song to his exuberant pictures of music-playing skeletons and fun information about human anatomy. The result is a book that entertains and educates this age group and gets them tapping their toe bones, too. Bravo.<br> <br></p></p><h2>The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms</h2><p>Two beloved and esteemed poets have collaborated on this intimate and useful anthology illuminating the history, practice, and wonder of our most elusive art. Intended for all those who love poetry, including teachers, readers, writers, and students, <i>The Making of a Poem</i> will be especially valued by those who feel that an understanding of form--sonnet, ballad, villanelle, sestina, etc.--would enhance their appreciation of poetry, but are daunted by the terms, the names, and the histories of various poetic forms. This anthology draws the reader in, by example and explanation, to the excitement and entertainment of these forms. It explains their origins, traces their development, and shows examples from the past and present. In a feature called "The form at a glance" the reader can try his or her own hand writing a particular form. Included are essays by each of the editors describing their own personal journeys toward a form for their poetic voice. Above all, this anthology shows that poetic form is a continuing adventure. Contemporary poets can be seen here trying out the same forms that poets used hundreds of years ago, but in the new circumstances of a complicated modern world. In this way poetic form is illustrated not as a series of rules, but as a passionate conversation in which every reader of poetry can become involved.</p><p><i>The Making of a Poem</i> is among the best how-to-read-poetry titles. Edited by two of our greatest living poets, one Irish and female, the other American and male, it is both an exploration of poetic forms and an anthology. Eavan Boland and Mark Strand each offer an introduction and then give us a series of chapters devoted to particular verse forms--the sonnet, the ballad, the sestina, the villanelle, blank verse, the stanza--as well as a long section devoted to what they somewhat vaguely call shaping forms. This refers to poetic structures established not by a specific rhyme and/or metrical pattern but by content: the elegy, for example, or the pastoral or ode. The book then concludes with a section on open forms. Each chapter is conveniently subdivided, each topic simply defined: a single page gives "The Ballad at a Glance" (or, for that matter, the pantoum) as a quick overview of the form's structure. A page or two on the history of the form follows, along with a brief comment on "the contemporary context." Then a chronological anthology of poems demonstrates the particular form. In the sonnet's case, for instance, we are treated to 23 brilliantly chosen examples--everything from Shakespeare's "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" to Seamus Heaney's "The Haw Lantern" to Mary Jo Salter's playful "Half a Double Sonnet." The section then concludes with another brief analysis of one example. In this spot, the villanelle features Elizabeth Bishop's classic heartbreaker, "One Art," and blank verse gives us far too brief a take on Robert Frost's tantalizing "Directive." Itself worth the price of admission, the poem begins: <blockquote> Back out of all this now too much for us,<br> Back in a time made simply by the loss<br> of detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off<br> Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,<br> There is a house that is no more than a house<br> Upon a farm that is no more than a farm<br> And in a town that is no more than a town.<br> </blockquote> One can readily see both the advantages and the limitations of such a format: definitions are kept lean, at times approaching the sound bite, and the short sentences and brief paragraphs often seem designed for a readership more accustomed to journalism than to the complexities of Dante (see, for example, the one-page history of the sestina). All of this looks like an attempt to reach an audience of both college students and general readers. While more information might help (brief comments on why certain poems in the anthology are defined as odes, pastorals, or elegies, for example), the bottom line is that <i>The Making of a Poem</i> does an excellent job of taking the inexperienced reader inside the mystery of poetic form. In these terms the volume succeeds, giving us a way into the history of poetry, along with an excellent anthology as a starting point for a deeper exploration of the glories of the genre. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>In the words of its editors, <i>The Making of a Poem</i> "looks squarely at some of the headaches and mysteries of poetic form." Here, two of our foremost poets provide a lucid, straightforward primer for those who have always felt that an understanding of form&#x2014;sonnet, ballad, villanelle, sestina, etc.&#x2014;would enhance their appreciation of poetry. By example and explanation, the anthology traces "the exuberant history of forms," a history that unites poets as diverse as John Keats and Joy Harjo (the Ode) or Geoffrey Chaucer and Jean Toomer (the Stanza). Each chapter is devoted to one form, offering explanation, close reading, and a rich selection of exemplars that amply demonstrate the power and possibility of the form.</p><h2>The Case of the Missing Marquess: An Enola Holmes Mystery</h2><p><p>When Enola Holmes, the much younger sister of detective Sherlock Holmes, discovers her mother has disappeared&#x2014;on her 14th birthday nonetheless&#x2014;she knows she alone can find her. Disguising herself as a grieving widow, Enola sets out to the heart of London to uncover her mother&#x2019;s whereabouts&#x2014;but not even the last name Holmes can prepare her for what awaits. Suddenly involved in the kidnapping of the young Marquess of Basilwether, Enola must escape murderous villains, free the spoiled Marquess, and perhaps hardest of all, elude her shrewd older brother&#x2014;all while collecting clues to her mother&#x2019;s disappearance!</p> <p>A remarkable debut of a new mystery series by two-time Edgar Awardwinning author Nancy Springer.</p></p><p><b>Nancy Springer</b> has published forty novels for adults, young adults and children. In a career beginning shortly after she graduated from Gettysburg College in 1970, Springer wrote for ten years in the imaginary realms of mythological fantasy, then ventured on contemporary fantasy, magical realism, and women's fiction before turning her attention to children's literature. Her novels and stories for middle-grade and young adults range from contemporary realism, mystery/crime, and fantasy to her critically acclaimed novels based on the Arthurian mythos, I AM MORDRED: A TALE OF CAMELOT and I AM MORGAN LE FAY. Springer's children's books have won her two Edgar Allan Poe awards, a Carolyn W. Field award, various Children's Choice honors and numerous ALA Best Book listings. Her most recent series include the Tales of Rowan Hood, featuring Robin Hood&#x2019;s daughter, and the Enola Holmes mysteries, starring the much younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.<p> Ms. Springer lives in East Berlin, Pennsylvania. </p>*Starred Review* Gr. 5-8. Springer, author of the popular Tales of Rowen Hood series featuring Robin Hood's daughter, mines the classics once more, and finds Sherlock Holmes' 14-year-old sister, Enola Holmes, who also has keen powers of observation. Enola lives alone with her mother on the family estate. Mrs. Holmes has always been a free spirit, but Enola is shocked when, on her birthday, her mother goes missing. Sherlock and Mycroft, Enola's long-absent, much-older brothers, arrive and assure her that they will look into the disappearance; she will be sent away to boarding school. Determined to avoid that fate, and anxious to find her mother on her own, Enola leaves for London, where she thinks her mother may be--a plan as shaky as the bicycle she sets off on. Along the way, she becomes enmeshed in another disappearance, the case of a young marquess, who seems to have been kidnapped, and in true Holmes fashion, Enola uses her powers of deduction to figure out his fate. This is a terrific package. Springer not only provides two fine mysteries (complete with clues and ciphers to solve), breathtaking adventure, and key-eyed description but she also offers a worthy heroine, who will be the center of a new series (the cover proclaims this "An Enola Holmes Mystery.") Enola is a high-spirited girl, just the right mix of nascent nineteenth-century feminist and awkward teen, with a first-person voice that's fun to hear.

Now Indiana Jones is called to London to recover an ancient alchemist&#x2019;s manuscript rumored to contain the formula both for turning lead into gold and granting its owner eternal life. Certain that a missing British alchemist and an insane Renaissance scholar are involved in the theft, Indy&#x2014;along with the alchemist&#x2019;s beautiful sister&#x2014;travels to Rome, and straight into the hands of Mussolini&#x2019;s fascists.<br><br>The mad scholar Sarducci has stolen the Voynich Manuscript, all right.

He lives in Pittsburgh, Kansas.<p>1<br> Bits of Trash and Bone<br><br> "What do you know of the Voynich Manuscript?"<br> Marcus Brody had asked the question while casually stirring cream and sugar into his coffee, but Indiana Jones had heard the tone--and had seen the sparkle in his&nbsp;old friend's eyes--before.<br> "Not much," Indy said, folding the morning edition of The New York Times and laying the newspaper aside. They were sitting at a sidewalk table beneath a canopy at the Tiger Coffee House on the corner of Nassau and Witherspoon, across the street from the Princeton University campus.<br> It was raining.<br> "As I recall, the manuscript is on loan at the rare book collection at Yale," Indy began, then took a sip from his mug of hot black coffee. "It is at least four hundred years old, was&nbsp;written in an unknown language by the alchemist Roger Bacon, and is reputed to hold the secret of the philosopher's stone--which, according to legend, has the power to turn lead into gold and to grant immortality. Its discovery created an international sensation a few years back, when I was a graduate student--it was called 'the world's most mysterious manuscript,' as I recall, but all attempts to decipher it have failed."<br> "Right as rain," Brody said, allowing himself a small smile. "I examined it once, more out of curiosity than anything else, but I couldn't make heads nor tails out of it. Don't think anyone could, not without the proper key."<br> "Why do you ask?"<br> "It's been stolen."<br> "It hasn't been reported in the papers."<br> "No,&nbsp;and I doubt that it will be," Brody said. "I learned of the theft just a few days ago when a pair of very serious government men visited me at the museum. And they asked quite a lot of questions about you."<br> "About me?"<br> "Yes," Brody said. "The universityhad told them you were away on a field expedition for the museum, and they wanted to know how to get in touch with you. Of course, I couldn't help them, since the Maya neglected to leave so much as a single public telephone in their ruins. Also, I didn't&nbsp;know when you would be back."<br> "I'm lucky to be back at all," Indy said.<br> For two years, since Brody had been named director of special acquisitions for the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the institution had quietly funded Indy's "research." The arrangement had enriched the museum's collection while allowing Indy the freedom to travel, which was a luxury not afforded by the salary of a university professor during the Great Depression.<br> Indy tugged absently at the necktie peeking above the collar of his sweater vest and stared at the cold spring rain lashing across Nassau Street in waves. An old woman was standing alone at curbside, selling apples from a wooden cart, her gray hair plastered to her head. Indy felt a growing sense of appreciation--and a momentary sense of guilt--for his dry seat, the warm coffee, and Brody's friendship.<br> "More coffee, Dr. Jones?"<br> "Pardon me?"<br> "Sir, would you care for more coffee?" the waiter asked.<br> "I'm sorry. I was someplace else for a moment," Indy said. "Nothank you. I have class soon."<br> Brody held up his hand, and the waiter passed.<br> "You say your visitors were government men?" Indy asked. "It makes me wonder why the FBI would be interested in the theft of something so unusual. Also, who would want to steal such a thing in the first place?"<br> "A private collector would be my first guess," Brody said. "That may be why they want to talk to you, to see if you could provide them with any leads."<br> "That's more your area than mine."<br> "Perhaps&nbsp;they want you to help them recover it," Brody said, and the sparkle was back. "If anybody can do it, you can."<br> "Not interested," Indy said. "I need a rest."<br> From his leather briefcase, Indy withdrew a sheaf of handwritten papers. "Here is the report on the Cozon expedition," he said. He had already briefed Brody earlier that morning about the loss of the Crystal Skull, but had carefully avoided any mention of the curse that&nbsp;Barnaby&#x17d;&nbsp;said it carried. "I'm sorry the story doesn't have a happier ending. I don't even know who those guys in the airplane were. I feel bad for wasting the museum's money by returning empty-handed."<br> Brody brushed the apology aside with a wave of his hand.<br> "Archaeology is not an exact science," he gently reminded Indy. "Every venture into the unknown carries with it an element of risk. The finds you have already made for us far outweigh any minor setback, and I am disappointed only because you are."<br> Indy shook his head.<br> "Sometimes I wonder what all of these dead bits of trash and bone really amount to in the scheme of things," Indy said. "There are so many hungry people in the world. I doubt that the woman selling apples there cares in the least for what happened a thousand years ago, or even yesterday. Yesterday, at least, the sun&nbsp;was shining."<br> "I worry about you when you become philosophic," Brody said. "We each have our part to play. It is true that too many of us are occupied right now with filling our stomachs. But you, my boy--the part you play with your bits of trash and bone&nbsp;helps to fill our souls. And who knows? You may one day discover an ancient secret that could help fill our stomachs as well."<br> Marcus leaned forward.<br> "The more we learn about the past, Indy, the less we are doomed to repeat it."<br> The rain slowed and finally dwindled to a few big drops breaking the surface of the puddles in the street. Indy reached out and cupped some of the water dripping from the edge of the white-and-green-striped canopy. He held the rainwater in his palm for a moment, then closed his&nbsp;hand, and the moisture seeped between his fingers.<br> "What's gotten into you, Indy?" Marcus asked. "I've never seen you so dispirited before. Do I need to recite your list of accomplishments?<br> "No, Marcus," he said. "I'm fine, really."<br> "Did something happen that you're not telling me about?" Marcus asked. "An affair of the heart. You met a beautiful Indian girl who--"<br> "Nothing like that," Indy said, brightening. "The only female I met on this&nbsp;trip was made of quartz and was a few dozen centuries too old for me." He finished his coffee and glanced at the sky. "It's been good to see you, Marcus, but I'd better make a run for it while I can."<br> "The coffee is on me," Brody said.<br> "Thanks," Indy said. "For everything."<br> "Won't you consider coming to New York to view the opening of the new Central American exhibit?" Brody asked. "It would do you good. It is really quite something to see, and as you know, you are responsible for the best pieces. Besides, it would be a good opportunity to introduce you to the Explorers' Club."<br> "Thanks, but no," Indy said. "I haven't even unpacked my bags yet. I just got out of one jungle, and I'm not anxious to plunge into another."<br> Indy donned his hat and slipped his&nbsp;leather case beneath his arm. The two men shook hands.<br> "I'll be in touch," Brody said. When Indy had left the coffee shop, Brody said to himself: "My boy, I hope she was worth it."<br> At the corner, Indy paused to buy an apple. He paid with a dollar bill, and when the woman protested that she didn't have ninety-five cents in change, he asked her to keep the money for something hot to eat.<br> Indy slipped the apple into his case while watching a new V-8 Ford pass, its tires singing on the wet pavement. The car&nbsp;was black, and the two men in the front seat wore dark suits and ties. A third man, in the back, was in uniform. The license plate on the rear fender identified the vehicle as government property.<br> Indy crossed to the Fitz Randolph Gateway. The wrought-iron gate was opened only on special occasions, and Indy had to pass through the smaller side entrance ordinarily used by students. He had made it halfway across the campus, and was abreast of the big cannon left over from the Revolutionary War, when the gray&nbsp;skies rumbled and began to pour again. By the time he reached the steps of McCormick Hall, Indy was soaked.<br> "All wet again, eh, Jones?"<br> "Gruber," Indy said.<br> Harold Gruber--a pipe-smoking medievalist with a passion for Machiavelli--was acting chairman of the Department of Art and Architecture at Princeton University.<br> Gruber took the briar from the corner of his mouth.<br> "Look here, Jones," he said, pointing the stem of his pipe at Indy. "You really ought to get an umbrella. There's no excuse for being unprepared."<br> "Thanks, Harry," Indy said.<br> "Harold," Gruber said.<br> Indy started up the stairs, his wet shoes squishing with every step. Gruber and his smoldering pipe followed.<br> "I'm rather glad I caught you," Gruber mumbled, the pipe again in the corner of&nbsp;his mouth. "There have been questions, you know, and as acting chair, I feel it is my duty to respond to them."<br> "Questions?" Indy asked over his shoulder.<br> "Um, yes," Gruber said. They had reached the top floor now, and Indy was leaving a trail of wet footprints as he marched to his office at the end of the hall. "We have a complaint from the British consulate about your activities in British Honduras. It seems they feel you trumped their antiquities law by reaching some sites in the interior by way of Guatemala--taking the back door, it would seem."<br> "The back door?" Indy asked.<br> Indy unlocked the door to 404E and slipped inside. A pile of messages had accumulated beneath the door, and he knelt to scoop them up.<br> "Well?" Gruber demanded.<br> A column of angry&nbsp;smoke rose from the briar. The tobacco was an especially foul shag mixture and it made Indy's eyes burn.<br> "I don't remember any back doors." Indy stood and shuffled through the messages as he spoke. "But I am notoriously bad about reading maps. I'll have&nbsp;to write my Guatemalan guide and ask him where exactly we were. Of course, Harry, it will take a few weeks to receive a reply. . . ."<br> Indy shut the door and locked it.<br><br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Cold Paradise (Stone Barrington)</h2><p>A thriller set on the Gold Coast of Florida finds street-smart former cop-turned-private investigator Stone Barrington on the trail of an elusive stalker who seems to be able to mimic people at will and who is targeting Allison Manning, a woman Stone had thought dead.</p><p>Suave, sophisticated Stone Barrington is a hero destined for the big screen. (Since Cary Grant is dead, Stone will have to be played by Bruce Willis, if he can keep his smirk under control.) He's certainly got the trappings: the Armani tuxedo too well-tailored to reveal the gun beneath the drape, the sexy sports cars, the beautiful women who never fail to throw themselves at him, the confident familiarity with a complicated wine list or French menu. And he's got friends in high places, which helps when you're looking for a beautiful woman who made a big impression on the slightly nerdy but nice software billionaire who hires Barrington to find her. <p> Between bedding the billionaire's chef in Palm Beach, hiding from the homicidal Mafia princess he almost married in Italy, and playing games with a Hollywood beauty whose young son may or may not be his very own child, Stone hardly has time to do the job he's been hired for. But when he does, he discovers that the object of his search is still another ex-lover, a woman he thought had been executed on a Caribbean island three years ago. All these women, and all these adventures, plus Stone's old pal Dino, a New York cop, will be familiar to readers of Woods's other Stone Barrington thrillers. This one has Woods's trademark narrative punch, solid pacing, and glossy, brand-name panache. If Judith Krantz wrote thrillers, this is what she'd turn out. But don't let that stop you. <i>Cold Paradise</i> is the perfect book for a hot day in the hammock or a long plane ride to a ritzy resort destination. The only real surprise is why Stone Barrington hasn't made it to the big (or small) screen yet. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Stuart Woods is the author of fifty novels, including the New York Timesbestselling Stone Barrington and Holly Barker series.

York&#39;s bravery on the battlefield made him famous, but it was his decision to turn down the easy riches of celebrity that secured his position as one of history&#39;s greatest Christian patriots. Based on new interviews with all of York&#39;s living children, and York&#39;s own diaries, this exhaustive biography follows the young soldier from the hills of Tennessee to the battlefields of France, down Broadway in a triumphant ticker-tape parade, and back home to his family farm where he spent the rest of his life in service to his community and his God.</p><p><b>John Perry</b> has coauthored books with John MacArthur, Richard Land, Mike Huckabee, among others and written historical books about Charles Colson, the Scopes Monkey Trials, and more.

What interests me first about these stores is what titles are being displayed in the 'Staff Recommends' section of the store. It is here that you can find treasured, beloved books quite dear to someone who works in the stores, someone waiting quite eagerly for the chance to hand sell their recommended titles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these Staff Recommend sections that I kept on seeing our Penman's titles, HERE BE DRAGONS, FALLS THE SHADOW, THE RECKONING and also SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR and WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT.<br>It's funny, you can sell something for years before you notice that the author has been quietly making a powerful impact on people everywhere.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with HERE BE DRAGONS and I have never looked back. Her trilogy of the decline of the Welsh kings ( DRAGON, FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING)is a holiday gift I give year after year, and I'm happy to say they have always been embraced and loved. From my 15 year old niece to my 70 year old mother and many ages in between, all readers are enchanted and transported to a land and an age gone forever. But Penman makes them live forever in our minds and hearts with fantastic, unforgettable characters and wonderful history. HERE BE DRAGONS is such a great title--medieval mapmakes would write those words across any part of the map that was unknown.. a wonderful metaphor for how little the Welsh and English knew of each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR--Warning: This is not Shakespeare's Richard III. In this novel, Richard is a victim of circumstance and man vilified by the Tudors, but here presented as a decent and normal man, a man of conscience.<br>AND he is not a murderer. Yes, those princes did die, but not by Richard's hand.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT<p>Another wonderful title, for it refers to the 15 years of England's darkest time-the civil war between the cousins Queen Maud and King Steven.

Most books depict him as a stiff, unapproachable figure, but here he is a loving, caring and devoted husband of a gracious, kind and remarkable lady.

Full color throughout.</p><p>After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>.

Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."</p><h2>The Collected Poems</h2><p>Containing everything that celebrated poet Sylvia Plath wrote after 1956, this is one of the most comprehensive collections of her work.

From lavish tomb paintings and imposing temple reliefs to humble household shrines, countless tributes throughout Egypt reflect the richness and complexity of their mythology. This book examines the evolution, worship, and eventual decline of the numerous gods and goddesses&#x2015;from minor household figures such as Bes and Taweret to the all-powerful deities Amun and Rethat made Egypt the most completely theocratic society of the ancient world, and made Egyptians, according to Herodotus, "more religious than any other people."<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� "Rise and Fall of the Gods" considers the origins of Egypt's deities, their struggles to control cosmic forces, and their eventual decline.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� "Nature of the Gods" examines the forms, appearances, and manifestations of the deities, as well as the transcendence of preeminent deities such as Amun.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� "Worship of the Gods" introduces the rituals and mysteries of formal Egyptian worship, including the importance of temples and festivals.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� "Kingship and the Gods" discusses the all-important position of the king, who served as a bridge between the gods and humanity.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� "The Many Faces of the Divine" is a unique catalogue of Egypt's gods and goddesses grouped according to their primary forms, discussing their iconography, mythology, and worship, and their influence over time.<br><br> With hundreds of illustrations and specially commissioned drawings, this is a comprehensive and authoritative guide to the deities that lay at the heart of Egyptian religion and society. 400 illustrations, 170 in color</p><p>Richard H. Wilkinson is Regents&#x2019; Professor of Egyptian Archaeology Emeritus and Founding Director of the Egyptian Expedition at the University of Arizona.Egyptologist Wilkinson presents a clear, comprehensive and beautifully illustrated (in color and b&amp;w) guide to the bewildering array of Egyptian deities-a complete catalogue of gods and goddesses supplemented by examinations of the history of Egyptian religion, the rise and fall of the gods, and the ways in which they were worshipped. Ancient Egypt was, Wilkinson writes, the most theocratic of any ancient culture; religion pervaded daily life for comoners as well as the pharaohs. This volume underscores the richness of ancient Egyptian beliefs: literally scores of deities are discussed, grouped by appearance: male anthropomorphic, female anthropomorphic, mammalian, avian, etc. For each god or goddess, the author discusses its mythology, iconography and forms of worship. Amun, or Amun-Re, for instance, one of the major male anthropomorphic gods, is discussed as creator god, solar god and fertility god, among other roles; he was originally portrayed with the color red; and he was honored with temples at Karnak and Luxor. This is an excellent reference work for budding Egyptologists and anyone fascinated by the culture of ancient Egypt. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Full of Grace: A Novel</h2><p><blockquote><p>The rich atmosphere of South Carolina, Hilton Head and Charleston, is brought vividly to life by Dorothea Benton Frank, a South Carolina native who, with her exquisitely evocative prose, makes you smell the sea air, see the palmettos, and savor the sweet tea, but this time it comes with a side of antipasti.</p></blockquote><p>Hilton Head, a South Carolina retirement heaven&#x2014;at least it's supposed to be, but for Big Al and Connie Russo, the move from New Jersey to this southern paradise has been fraught with just a few complications. Especially for their daughter, Grace.</p><p>Well, that's what she likes to be called. Her family insists on Maria Graziella. Seriously, enough with the Neapolitan. That might have been okay in New Jersey, but now it's just plain silly, and Grace at thirty-two is, horror of horrors, still unmarried. No wonder her family drives her crazy. Well, that and the fact that she's living with the man she would marry if they both weren't so commitment phobic. Michael is a doctor and a scientist and Grace is pretty sure he's also an atheist. Over the years, Grace has become a bit ambivalent about her faith, but her family is as old-fashioned Italian as they come. So the stage is set for a major showdown that just might change Grace's outlook on life, family, and the New South.</p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestseller Dorothea Benton Frank was born and raised on Sullivans Island, South Carolina.

Transplanted to the South from an Italian New Jersey neighborhood, Grace is full of spunk and irreverence, which tax her family. Susan Bennett reads with the same cheekiness and boldness demonstrated by Grace's rejection of her family's Catholic values. Bennett does equally well narrating the character of Michael, Grace's live-in Southern partner, as he fights a brain tumor. Full of traditional family dynamics, as well as a dose of miracles, Frank's novel is deeply spiritual. Bennett's adept handling of the aspects of faith and humor produces an entertaining and thought-provoking listening experience.

Plus they'll love the character who masters his fear and is brave in the face of death. Trust me on this."<br><br>Peter always gave Teddy notes, too, so Brad wouldn't think he was picking on him. "Nice job," Peter told him, "but I can't help feeling like you're waiting to be shot."<br><br>"I am," Teddy said. "If I were doing it, I'd have stepped up and shot him in the head. He wouldn't have had time to say 'please.'"<br><br>"Yes, but you're not you. You're Leonard Kirk, a cold-blooded killer and a dangerous man, but not infallible. The type of man who might make a mistake through arrogance. He wants to hear his victims say please."<br><br>Teddy grinned. "You couldn't just rewrite the script and let me shoot Brad?"<br><br>"It might change the plot a little."<br><br>Peter Barrington was shooting a scene from his new film, Desperation at Dawn, on location on the streets of L.A. It was a night shoot, which was hard enough to light without all the special effects. If the blood from the blood bags wasn't lit just right it appeared fake, which of course it was. And the moonlight had to reflect off the cold steel of Teddy's gun. There was a huge difference between an adequate shot and a good shot. Some directors didn't know it. They worked with the actors, and that was it. Peter Barrington was on top of everything. That's why his films were so good.<br><br>The second AD led Teddy back to the makeup and wardrobe trailer. Part of the second assistant director�s job was being in charge of the cast, keeping track of where the actors were at all times and seeing they made it to the set. Actors had a tendency to wander, hence they were escorted even to places they knew well. Teddy sat down at the makeup counter, where a swarm of crew members from props, special effects, makeup, hair, and wardrobe stripped off his shirt and removed the spent squibs and blood bags that provided the shooting effect.<br><br>Marsha Quickly, the actress who came out of the door before the shooting, was touching up her makeup in the chair next to his. She smiled at Teddy. "How many times do I have to watch you get shot?"<br><br>Teddy grinned. "You love it and you know it."<br><br>"Don't be silly."<br><br>"Turns you on, doesn't it?"<br><br>Teddy Fay, aka producer Billy Barnett, aka weapons expert and stuntman Mark Weldon, had evolved into a character actor as the man you loved to hate. His on-screen presence had tested so highly, Peter had begun using him regularly. Teddy had adopted the screen name Mark Weldon so as not to draw attention to the producer Billy Barnett. With Teddy's facility for makeup, there was no danger of anyone recognizing him on-screen.<br><br>A costume lady wiped the blood off Teddy's chest and helped him into a clean white shirt. She left it unbuttoned so they could hang the fresh blood bags.<br><br>"I haven't seen you on the set before," Teddy said to the actress. "Are you shooting tomorrow?"<br><br>"I wish. I'm a Day Player, just in the one scene."<br><br>Day Player was a bit of an exaggeration. Marsha was actually a Silent Bit, an extra with no lines but a specific action. In Marsha's case it involved walking out the door.<br><br>Teddy nodded sympathetically.<br><br>Iris, the makeup lady, tapped his cheek and gave him her patented if-you-wouldn't-mind smile once she had his attention. Teddy shrugged helplessly to the actress, then sat up straight and faced the makeup mirror like a good boy while Iris touched him up.<br><br>Marsha side-spied Mark Weldon and wondered if he was worth making a play for. He was certainly handsome enough, but could he help her career? Marsha hated to be so mercenary, but it was tough in L.A. for an actress, at least for one getting nothing but two-second, silent-bit parts. She decided he probably wasn�t worth pursuing. A name actor might help her, but a stuntman in the film just to get killed wouldn�t have much clout.<br><br>The wig Mark had been using as a villain was askew, having slipped when he slid to the ground. As Iris adjusted it, Marsha was struck by the familiarity of the face underneath.<br><br>She knew him. In her former life as Bambi, a cocktail waitress and shill at the New Desert Inn and Casino, a high-end casino in Las Vegas, she had known him as Billy Burnett, a high roller who had run off with one of casino boss Pete Genaro's right-hand girls. The last she had heard, Genaro was moving heaven and earth to find her.<br><br>Marsha smiled. What little extra work she'd been getting lately hadn't been paying the rent. She wondered what this little tidbit of information might be worth.<br><br>2<br><br>Pete Genaro, the owner and operator of the New Desert Inn and Casino, answered the phone with his customary growl. "Genaro."<br><br>"Hey, Pete," Marsha laughed. "Don't bite my head off. I'm on your side."<br><br>"Who's this?"<br><br>"Marsha Quickly."<br><br>"Who?"<br><br>"Bambi. I used to work for you."<br><br>Genaro searched his memory for a Bambi and seemed to remember a cocktail waitress with blond hair and long legs.<br><br>"Oh, yeah. What's up? You want your job back?"<br><br>"No, I'm an actress now out in Hollywood. I'm doing fine," she lied. "Of course, one can always use some spare change. I have a tip for you. The high roller who ran off with one of your girls, Billy Burnett, wasn't it? The guy who ran off with Charmaine?"<br><br>"What about him?"<br><br>"I just ran into him on a movie set. He's changed his appearance, and he's working as a stuntman."<br><br>"Are you sure it's him?"<br><br>"I saw them touching up his makeup."<br><br>"Oh? That's interesting."<br><br>Genaro took down the information. He'd send Bambi, or whatever she was calling herself these days, a nice bonus to keep the contact open, but she was out of date with her news. Genaro had been trying to find Billy Burnett, had even hired a skip tracer to find him. Not because he cared about some high roller making off with a girl-the girls were a dime a dozen-but rather, at the insistence of one of his guests and board members, a Russian gentleman who proved so odious Genaro had him voted off the board of directors and ousted him from the hotel. He then warned Billy Burnett, whom the skip tracer had found working at Centurion Pictures under the name of Billy Barnett, that the Russian was coming. So Genaro had no intention of acting on Bambi's hot tip. He just filed the information for future reference.<br><br>At the moment, Genaro had other things on his mind. Sammy Candelosi had just purchased the casino next door. That couldn't be good. Genaro didn't know Sammy Candelosi, but the man was reputed to have mob connections, and was not to be trifled with. Genaro had no intention of trifling with him. He intended to give Sammy a wide berth.<br><br>Genaro's intercom buzzed.<br><br>"What is it?" he growled irritably.<br><br>"Sammy Candelosi is here to see you."<br><br>Genaro scowled. "Send him in."<br><br>3<br><br>Sammy Candelosi looked like he'd just stepped out of a barbershop. His curly black hair was neatly trimmed, his cheeks razor-smooth. He gave the impression he was professionally shaved every day. His dark blue suit could have financed a small casino. His black leather shoes gleamed, and his steely gray eyes never blinked, giving the impression that they missed nothing.<br><br>"I'm so glad we could have this meeting," Sammy said. Somehow he acted as if he were the host. "This is my associate, Mr. Slythe."<br><br>Slythe wore a pale blue turtleneck instead of a tie, and an off-white suit. His look was not welcoming. He neither smiled nor gestured. His eyes were calculating, constantly taking in information.<br><br>Genaro had a goon on hand for muscle. "This is my associate, Jake. Gentlemen, please be seated."<br><br>Sammy was already pulling up a chair.<br><br>Pete Genaro smoldered and tried to think of some way he could regain the upper hand.<br><br>"So, have you ever run a casino before, Mr. Candelosi?"<br><br>"I've been in them," Sammy said.<br><br>Genaro wasn't sure if it was a joke. "Well, they don't run themselves. You need good people. The money's steady, but it's work."<br><br>"The money's steady?" Sammy said.<br><br>"It is."<br><br>"Shouldn't it be increasing?"<br><br>"It is. A steady increase."<br><br>"Again with the word 'steady.'"<br><br>Genaro frowned. "What are you trying to say?"<br><br>Sammy lit a cigar, looking around for an ashtray. Genaro moved one across the desk for him. Sammy flicked his cigar in that general direction. "You've been in this business a long time."<br><br>"I have. I know the ins and outs, if there's anything you need to know."<br><br>"I need to know why you're not rich."<br><br>Pete Genaro's mouth fell open. "I beg your pardon?"<br><br>Sammy shrugged. "A casino is a gold mine. It mints money. People bring money to it, leave money in it, and take away nothing. There's no product. In any other business, you're selling something. Say it's olive oil: You have it, you sell it, you run low, you need to restock your supply. But with a casino, people show up and happily plunk their money down to buy nothing. Money for nothing. That's the best business in the world. So I take a look at your casino as I walk in, and I'm saying to myself, that's a pretty nice operation. They should be making more money. So I'm thinking, how can we make that happen?" Sammy took a puff on his cigar. "Seems to me the easiest thing for me to do is buy you out."<br><br>Genaro was dumbfounded. "What?"<br><br>"I mean, here we are, next door to each other, in competition with each other. How much better to pool our resources? If I were to buy you out and run both organizations at the same time, think of the cost benefit. Some of middle management would become redundant, and there would be no reason to waste money attempting to lure players away from each other."<br><br>"We don't do that."<br><br>"Oh, no? I comp a high roller a suite, you comp him a suite and a hooker. I have nothing against gamblers getting laid, but why should I pay for it?"<br><br>"Mr. Candelosi, I have no intention of selling."<br><br>"Don't you have a board of directors? Wouldn't they have to consider a bid?" Sammy flicked his ash. "Anyway, assuming a merger might be in store, any accommodation I can make, or any advice you might have on the operation of a casino, I'm not too old a dog to learn a new trick."<br><br>Sammy smiled and spread his arms, as if they were the best of friends.<br><br>Son of a bitch!� Genaro growled.<br><br>Jake, on his way back from seeing Sammy out, said, "Who?"<br><br>"Who do you think? Sammy fucking Candelosi! He knows I'm not going to sell. That wasn't a genuine offer. That was just posturing, strutting his stuff, trying to assert himself because he's the new kid in town and he doesn't like it. Well, he picked the wrong man to meddle with." Genaro jerked his thumb. "Get over there and find out what he's doing."<br><br>"How do I do that?"<br><br>"Say I sent you to help him."<br><br>"Why would you do that?"<br><br>"To find out what he's doing!"<br><br>"But-"<br><br>"Hey, you say I sent you to help. He won't buy it, but you get to look around. Talk to his goon."<br><br>"He don't look like he talks much."<br><br>"Give it a shot. The worst that happens is it doesn't work."<br><br>"The worst that happens is he shoots me in the fuckin' head."<br><br>Genaro shrugged. "Then we'll know it didn't work."<br><br>Pete Genaro didn�t know who he was dealing with. Sammy Candelosi sized Jake up as the Trojan horse he knew him to be, and asked him to walk the floor with his man Slythe to tell him who his best men were. Jake, who had no idea which employees were any good, pointed out a dealer and pit boss just because he knew their names.<br><br>The next morning, the pit boss was found floating facedown in his swimming pool, and the dealer's car blew up.<br><br>The police had no problem following the trail from Sammy and Slythe, who volunteered that Genaro's man Jake had identified the victims as Sammy's best men, to Jake, who admitted he'd done that, to Pete Genaro, who was apoplectic. He was certainly the most likely suspect in the two murders, but he was innocent. Sammy Candelosi had killed his own men just to get him in trouble.</p><h2>A Great Aridness: Climate Change and the Future of the American Southwest</h2><p>With its soaring azure sky and stark landscapes, the American Southwest is one of the most hauntingly beautiful regions on earth. Yet staggering population growth, combined with the intensifying effects of climate change, is driving the oasis-based society close to the brink of a Dust-Bowl-scale catastrophe.<br><br>In <em>A Great Aridness</em>, William deBuys paints a compelling picture of what the Southwest might look like when the heat turns up and the water runs out. This semi-arid land, vulnerable to water shortages, rising temperatures, wildfires, and a host of other environmental challenges, is poised to bear the heaviest consequences of global environmental change in the United States. Examining interrelated factors such as vanishing wildlife, forest die backs, and the over-allocation of the already stressed Colorado River--upon which nearly 30 million people depend--the author narrates the landscape's history--and future. He tells the inspiring stories of the climatologists and others who are helping untangle the complex, interlocking causes and effects of global warming. And while the fate of this region may seem at first blush to be of merely local interest, what happens in the Southwest, deBuys suggests, will provide a glimpse of what other mid-latitude arid lands worldwide--the Mediterranean Basin, southern Africa, and the Middle East--will experience in the coming years. <br><br>Written with an elegance that recalls the prose of John McPhee and Wallace Stegner, <em>A Great Aridness</em> offers an unflinching look at the dramatic effects of climate change occurring right now in our own backyard.<br></p><p><br><strong>William deBuys</strong> is the author of seven books, including <em>River of Traps: A New Mexico Mountain Life</em>, a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book of the Year and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in general non-fiction in 1991; <em>Enchantment and Exploitation: The Life and Hard Times of a New Mexico Mountain Range; The</em> <em>Walk</em> (an excerpt of which won a Pushcart Prize in 2008), and <em>Salt Dreams: Land and Water in Low-Down California</em>. An active conservationist, deBuys has helped protect more than 150,000 acres in New Mexico, Arizona, and North Carolina. He lives and writes on a small farm in northern New Mexico.<br><br>"The book is long and covers some topics that seem daunting at first, but it is well worth the read if you are looking for a deeper understanding of this somewhat overwhelming topic.[...] deBuys ties in so many seemingly disparate issues to create a big picture of the Southwest's future, and doesn't shy away from taking a stance on potentially alienating subjects like immigration, indigenous land struggles, and corrupt bureaucracies." -- <em>Earth First</em><p></p><br>"DeBuys delivers thoughtful portraits of efforts to ameliorate conditions . . . readers will appreciate this intelligent account of water politics, forest ecology and urban planning in a region seriously stressed even before global warming arrived to make matters worse." <br>--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"With wide-eyed wonder and the clearest of prose, deBuys explains why we should care about these places, the people he portrays, and the conundrums over land and water he illuminates. No longer are aridity and climate change in the Southwest only of regional interest; deBuys is writing for America and we should all listen to what he has to say." --<em>Booklist</em> (starred review) <br><p></p><br>"Drawing on the work of climatologists and other scientists, deBuys's analysis of the eco-crisis - rising temperatures, wildfires, water shortages, disappearing wildlife - is a reasoned warning to heavily populated arid regions round the world." - <em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"A Great Aridness is his most disturbing book, a jeremiad that ought to be required reading for politicians, economists, real-estate developers and anyone thinking about migrating to the Sunbelt." --<em>American Scientist</em> <br><p></p><br>"Non-experts who want a concrete sense of climate change's impact - and a lyrical reading experience - should turn to A Great Aridness." - <em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"DeBuys's research takes place in the field, one of the real strengths of this book. In lyrical prose rich in place and politics, his stories take us from the Navajo reservation to research labs.... A Great Aridness is both fascinating and frightening." --Orion <br><p></p><br>"Across the board global warming in the Southwest will challenge us morally, artistically, economically, politically, and socially. DeBuy's triumpth is to summarize, in clear and elegant prose, those challenges as they appear today." --<em>Western American Literature 49:3</em><p></p><br>"William deBuys, one of our finest environmental historians, offers a narrative that follows the trajectory of Keeling's awesome arc. ... The story deBuys tells is informative, thought provoking, and elegantly written." --<em>Western Historical QUarterly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Son of Rosemary</h2><p>In the sequel to Rosemary&#39;s Baby, Rosemary awakens from a twenty-seven-year coma to find her that her son, Andy, now thirty-three years old, is a charismatic spiritual leader commanding a worldwide following and preaching a message of peace and tolerance. 150,000 first printing.

Hidden in the caves at Qumran by the Essenes, a Jewish sect in existence before and during the time of Jesus, the Scrolls have transformed our understanding of the Hebrew Bible, early Judaism, and the origins of Christianity. This fully revised edition of the classic English translation by Geza Vermes, the world&#39;s leading scholar on the subject, offers an astonishing look into the organization, customs, and beliefs of the community at Qumran. Enhanced by much previously unpublished material and a new preface, this will remain the authoritative translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls for years to come.</p><p>It's been 50 years since a Bedouin youth named Muhammed edh-Dhub went looking for a stray sheep and instead found the Dead Sea Scrolls. In the intervening decades, the scrolls have been enveloped in a storm of controversy and bitter conflict: the scholars entrusted with translating and editing the texts sat on many of them instead, creating suspicions that escalated to conspiracy theories about supposed cover-ups of sensitive, even damaging material. Geza Vermes, a former professor of Jewish studies at Oxford and a noted authority on the scrolls, marks the 50th anniversary of Muhammed edh-Dhub's find with his book <i>The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English</i>; the title, however, is misleading, for the collection of documents is by no means complete. <p> Vermes has left out the copies of Hebrew scriptures that are available elsewhere, instead focusing on the sectarian writings of the Essene community at Qumran and the intertestemental texts, and these are indeed complete translations. Vermes has also included an overview of five decades of research on the scrolls and a thumbnail sketch of the Qumran community's history and religion. For anyone interested in biblical history, <i>The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English</i> is a worthwhile read.</p>Geza Vermes&#x2019;s pioneering work on the Dead Sea Scrolls and the historical Jesus led to his appointment as the first professor of Jewish studies at Oxford University, where he is now professor emeritus. He is the author of several books, including <i>The Authentic Gospel of Jesus</i>. <br>Geza Vermes&#x2019;s pioneering work on the Dead Sea Scrolls and the historical Jesus led to his appointment as the first professor of Jewish studies at Oxford University, where he is now professor emeritus.

Every Christmas, he commissions an artist to paint a traditional nativity scene to be dramatically revealed after midnight mass. This year, though, the date is mere weeks away, and he still has not yet found his painter. The king decides to take a chance on a peculiar, mute boy whose artistic genius and clairvoyance are rumored throughout the kingdom. He sends three valiant, if begrudging, knights to seek out the boy in the remote countryside. Finally, they find Benjamin -- and he is, indeed, peculiar. Nobody knows if the child is up to the task, but the king's Christmas tradition -- and Benjamin himself -- might just be saved by a Christmas miracle that comes in the form of a very special pig -- who is rather peculiar herself.</p><p><b>Kinky Friedman</b> lives in a little green trailer somewhere in the hills of Texas. He has five dogs, one armadillo, and one Smith-Corona typewriter. By the time you are reading this, Mr. Friedman may either be celebrating becoming the next governor of Texas or he may have retired in a petulant snit.Prolific novelist and Texas gubernatorial candidate Friedman sets his winning tearjerker Christmas story in a faraway land, where a "good king" decides he needs an artist to create a nativity scene to reawaken the Christmas spirit among his dejected subjects. His adviser suggests Benjamin for the job, a 10-year-old who exhibits symptoms of autism (he doesn't speak and feels no emotion, but is a gifted painter). Benjamin undertakes the king's commission and works on the painting in a barn, where he befriends Valerie, a talking pig who brings Benjamin out of his autistic shell. He wants to paint his porcine best friend into the scene, but fears he can't because pigs don't appear in the biblical story.

From scores of candid and exclusive interviews, from private documents and public records, New York Times bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer has dug deeply into her paternal and maternal family roots to reveal the often shocking, tragic, and comic lives that helped shape the world&#x2019;s most famous and fabulous &#x201c;celebutante.&#x201d; <br><br>The cast of characters includes Paris&#x2019;s maternal grandmother, a materialistic &#x201c;stage mother from hell.&#x201d; There is Paris&#x2019;s maternal grandfather, who became an alcoholic housepainter. The life of Paris&#x2019;s mother, Kathy Hilton, groomed by her mother to be a star and marry rich, is candidly revealed, too, as is that of Paris&#x2019;s father, Rick, Conrad&#x2019;s grandson. <br><br>Paris&#x2019;s tabloid antics are truly in the Hilton tradition. Set against a glittery Hollywood backdrop&#x2014;with appearances by stars like Elizabeth Taylor, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Natalie Wood, and Joan Collins&#x2014;House of Hilton brings to light a cornucopia of closely held Hilton family secrets and sexual peccadilloes, such as the many affairs and the nightclub-brawling, boozing, and pill-popping life of Paris&#x2019;s great-uncle, Nick Hilton. The story of his hellish marriage to Liz Taylor alone rivals any of today&#x2019;s Hollywood breakups. <br><br>Behind it all was Conrad Hilton, who built his worldwide empire through the Great Depression while others were jumping out of windows. A devout Catholic publicly, his personal life was that of an unrepentant sinner. His first marriage was to Mary Barron Hilton, a sexy, hard-drinking, gambling Kentucky teenager half Conrad&#x2019;s age. Wife number two was the gorgeous Zsa Zsa, who, like Paris, was famous for being famous. Their tumultuous marriage and headline-making divorce are revealed here in all their juicy glory. <br><br>In all, <i>House of Hilton</i> is a gripping American saga, from the fire and passions that built a business empire to the debauchery and amorality passed on from one generation to the next.</p><p>Jerry Oppenheimer is a New York Times bestselling author who has been writing definitive biographies of American icons for twenty years. He has worked in all facets of journalism, from national investigative reporting in Washington DC to producing TV news and documentaries.Like many children of the rich and famous, Paris Hilton didn't always get to spend quality time with her parents, especially her mother. A socially ambitious young woman, Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino Richards Hilton, who had married into the celebrated Hilton Hotel family, was often out and about. With little time on her hands for mothering, she was cavalier about leaving her firstborn with the hired help or with relatives.<br><br>This was made abundantly clear to Patricia Skipworth Hilton, the first wife of Conrad Hilton's third son, Eric. A Texas beauty who had married into the Hilton family in her late teens, Pat, a mother of four, had become quite close over the years to her sister-in-law and brother-in-law, Marilyn and Barron Hilton, parents of Kathy's husband, Rick. The second of Conrad's three sons, Barron had succeeded the Hilton patriarch as head of the international hotel empire. Pat adored Marilyn, a former cheerleader who herself was a gorgeous teenage bride when she became part of the Hilton family. (The Hilton men, from Conrad on down, were known for taking young'uns for their brides.)<br><br>Whenever Pat visited Los Angeles from her home in Houston, Marilyn insisted that she stay at their spectacular estate. It was during one of those occasions, when Pat was "in the throes" of one of her many divorce actions in what was a hellish marriage to Eric Hilton--hellish marriages not being an oddity in the Hilton dynasty--that she observed new mother Kathy Hilton in action.<br><br>"I was there talking with Marilyn when here comes Kathy with Paris, who was nine months old and a great big, fat, pretty baby," Pat Hilton says in her Lone Star State drawl. "Kathy said, 'Meet Star'--she called Paris 'Star' from day one--'Would you like to hold her for a minute?' That was the last I saw Kathy that day. She took off until that evening. I wanted to kill her! She didn't leave any instructions on what time Paris had to be fed. There weren't any diapers. She just left me in the lurch."<br><br>Furious, Pat vented to Marilyn, who listened sympathetically and knowingly, and rolled her eyes. "Marilyn said, laughing, 'Well, I guess you're it for the day. Kathy does this all the time. She just wants to go out. And she knew you'd take care of the kid.'"<br><br>When Kathy finally reappeared at day's end, Pat confronted her. "How dare you do this to me?" According to Pat, "Kathy's only reply was, 'Oh, I had to be somewhere. I didn't think you'd mind.' I warned her, 'Never, ever do this to me again!' But it didn't bother her at all. Kathy Hilton's very selfish and very spoiled and very self-centered, and that absolutely carries through to Paris."<br><br>When Rick and Kathy Hilton traveled and deigned to bring Paris along, they naturally stayed in Hilton hotels, where they demanded special services, including babysitting care for their daughter, despite the fact that Barron Hilton had a strict rule barring Hiltons from getting special treatment or favorable room rates.<br><br>"When they were in New York, and Paris was just an infant, Kathy and Rick would get one of the women from housekeeping at the New York Hilton to babysit for them," states a Hilton Hotels insider. "They would leave Paris on Friday and not come back for her until late Sunday. It was a known fact that Kathy and Rick liked to party, and when Kathy was a young mother she had no qualms about flaunting the Hilton name and taking advantage of it. She'd let it be known that Rick was going to be 'the next Mr. Hilton,' so hotel executives were afraid to argue with her. None of Barron's [eight] kids were getting a free ride. The only one who ever took advantage was Kathy."<br><br>Kathy and Rick were prone to show up out of the blue without reservations at a Hilton hotel on a busy weekend and demand the best suite in the house, fine wine and food, and babysitting for Paris. One of their targets was the Hilton in Parsippany, New Jersey, which had a four-star restaurant and a hip discotheque. The hotel also housed a number of lavishly furnished suites leased by big corporations.<br><br>When Paris was just a toddler, Rick and Kathy appeared on a busy Friday with her in tow along with their two small dogs (which weren't permitted in the hotel unless they were Seeing Eye dogs). Though the hotel was fully booked, they made it clear they were Hiltons and wanted VIP treatment--the best suite, complimentary food, and a babysitter because Paris's parents wanted to spend the night boogying in the disco. The manager, who didn't want to get in hot water with members of the ruling family, broke the ironclad no-special-treatment rule and put them in a suite, vacant for the weekend, that was leased by the pharmaceutical company Warner-Lambert.<br><br>"I thought, 'What the hell, they're going to leave on Sunday so it will work out,'" he says. "But no sooner do I get back to my office, I get a call from Rick Hilton who says, 'It's customary that we get a welcoming amenity.' I told him, 'Oh, absolutely.' Then he says, 'We like a nice California red wine and something white, and my wife likes seafood.' And then he demanded a babysitter. I had to convince the hotel's elderly German seamstress to do the sitting."<br><br>The manager felt relieved when the Hiltons checked out Sunday night, because Warner-Lambert people were coming in the next morning. But then he got a call to return to the hotel posthaste because there was a major crisis.<br><br>"I go up to the suite the Hiltons were using, and there's dog shit and dog piss all over the place--I mean everywhere. They didn't walk their dogs for the entire weekend. It was a real nightmare. We ended up having housekeeping do a detailed, deep cleaning. After all that, I never heard a word from Rick or Kathy Hilton--never got a thank-you, nothing. But that's where their mind-set is. They act like the imperial court."<br><br>Kathy and Rick also threw their weight around at the Las Vegas Hilton, another place where they liked to party, and where Paris was spotted as a little girl wearing mascara and eyeliner painted on by her mother. (By then, Kathy was booking Paris into charity event fashion shows.) The Hiltons, including Paris and her sister, Nicky, quickly earned a reputation at the Sin City Hilton for "arrogance, threats, and intimidation," according to a number of present and former employees, such as Margaret Mary (Peggy) Cusack Yakovlev, who also served as a personal assistant to Eric Hilton and his second wife, Bibi.<br><br>"Kathy and Rick and the girls looked down their noses at the help and were very judgmental," states Yakovlev. "Paris and Nicky were running loose in the hotel, were always trouble, and the mother always seemed to be coaching them." She notes that the Hilton sisters usually were accompanied by hired help who looked like they were treated despicably.<br><br>When Paris and Nicky informed hotel employees who they were, the workers ran the other way. The philosophy was--if you run into Rick and Kathy or their daughters, just keep your head down and your mouth shut. "Kathy was absolutely pushy, arrogant, condescending, and presumptuous, and Paris picked that up from her," observes Yakovlev. "The spotlight always had to be on Kathy. It was always, 'Do you know who we are?' 'Do you know who I am?' Rick was usually like a bump on a log. He had a look on his face like he was taking a bowel movement."<br><br>However, Yakovlev remembers an incident in which Paris's father was shockingly outspoken. It happened some weeks after Kathy Hilton gave birth to one of their two sons, Conrad and Barron. Rick Hilton was smoking a celebratory cigar outside the main entrance of the Las Vegas Hilton's crowded celebrity showroom. Yakovlev, who was standing nearby, overheard another Hilton employee congratulating the proud father on having such a large and handsome brood. "She asked him what he attributed it to," says Yakovlev, "and he said, loud enough for anyone to hear, 'I like to fuck!' Guests were passing by and heard it and looked at him. I couldn't believe it." (Some detractors felt that Rick and Kathy did not measure up to the proud Hilton name. One, who personally knew the family, even put his feelings into print. Taki Theodoracopoulos, a controversial figure who wrote the "High Life" column for Britain's respected Spectator magazine, declared in a column that Kathy and Rick "are straight out of The Beverly Hillbillies." He claimed, "They eat hamburgers covered with ketchup washed down with Chateau Latour." He called Rick "a hick . . . as thick as they come," and proclaimed that neither Rick nor Kathy would ever "win the Parenting of the Year award.")<br><br>When Paris was about twelve and still on the innocent side, she had pet ferrets that she carried in her Prada purse. The cute little rodents accompanied her everywhere she went in the hotel, which caused headaches for the Hilton managers, who were afraid to challenge her for fear of her mother's wrath.<br><br>On one occasion, Yakovlev recalls, Paris and her sister showed up at the glitzy hotel showroom where the big acts entertained audiences of thirteen hundred at each performance. "The girls brought the ferrets in with them and Rick and Kathy didn't care. They could not see any further ahead than what their children wanted, while we were responsible for the safety of the guests. We did not want those little rodents escaping and rubbing up against customers' ankles."<br><br>One of the managers with gumption decided to confront the Hiltons. "You need to get your girls and your rodents out of here," he told the Hiltons. "They're not coming in. I am not allowing them."<br><br>Kathy Hilton put her hands on her hips and got in his face and said, "Well, their grandfather [Barron] will certainly hear about this! Their grandfather is going to know from me how you are treating his granddaughters." The manager's businesslike but emphatic response was, "You ...</p><h2>Flying Apron's Gluten-Free &amp; Vegan Baking Book</h2><p>Over the last decade, a vegan diet has become a more mainstream choice; food allergies have been increasing at alarming rates; and celiac disease is on everyone&#39;s radar.

In addition to killing approximately 20 million soldiers and civilians, the war also ignited the Russian Revolution, sowed the anger that allowed Hitler to seize power, and permanently darkened our outlook on human nature and human self-destructiveness. But also I&#x2019;ve always seen the war as a time when men and women faced a moral challenge as great as that faced by those who lived, say, in the time of slavery. Tens of thousands of people were wise enough to foresee, in 1914, the likely bloodshed that a war among the world&#x2019;s major industrial powers would cause&#x2014;and, courageously, they refused to take part. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are you trying to do in To End All Wars that makes it different from other books about the First World War? </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Most books about any war, including this one, tell the story as a conflict between two sides. Instead, I&#x2019;ve tried to tell the story of 1914&#x2013;1918 as a struggle between those who felt the war was something noble and necessary, and those who felt it was absolute madness. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Were there war resisters on both sides?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. But I&#x2019;ve concentrated on one country, Britain. For various reasons&#x2014;a major one being that at the war&#x2019;s outset Britain itself was not attacked&#x2014;there was a stronger antiwar movement there than anywhere else. More than 20,000 British men of military age refused the draft, and, as a matter of principle, many also refused the non-combatant alternative service offered to conscientious objectors, such as working in war industries or driving ambulances. More than 6,000 of these young men went to prison under very harsh conditions, as did some brave, outspoken critics of the war. This is one of the largest groups of people ever behind bars for political reasons in a Western democracy&#x2014;and certainly one of the most interesting. Their number included the country&#x2019;s leading investigative journalist, a future Nobel Prize-winner, more than half a dozen future members of Parliament, and a former editor who would publish a clandestine prison newspaper on sheets of toilet paper. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> So the book is just about them?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Not only. I am equally intrigued by the people who fought the war, such as the generals who always thought the next battle was going to be the big breakthrough, and kept the cavalry ready to charge through the gap&#x2014;which never came, of course. So my cast of characters includes both resisters and those who fought. And there are interesting ties between them. Few people know, for instance, that Britain&#x2019;s commander-in-chief on the Western Front for the first year and a half of combat had a sister who was an ardent, vocal pacifist. Or that the Minister for War had close friends whose son was not only in jail as a resister but was in solitary confinement for refusing to obey prison rules. Two well-known sisters, the suffragettes Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst, broke with each other so bitterly over the war that they each edited a newspaper that attacked the other. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are all of your characters well-known?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Not at all. Albert Rochester was a soldier who got into trouble for writing a letter to a newspaper complaining that every British officer had his own private servant. John S. Clarke was an antiwar radical, working underground&#x2014;who in his youth had made his living as a circus lion-tamer. Emily Hobhouse believed the nations of Europe should be negotiating, not fighting. She evaded British government travel restrictions, went to Berlin in 1916 and talked peace terms with the foreign minister&#x2014;the sole private citizen in Europe who actually traveled to the other side in search of peace. You couldn&#x2019;t invent people like this. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What were your sources of information?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> When I write history, I like to hear people&#x2019;s own voices, so as much as possible I relied on personal letters, diaries, memoirs and the like. But there was one additional, unexpected, rich trove of material. In 1914&#x2013;1918, both civilian and military intelligence agents watched the Britain&#x2019;s antiwar activists intently. They infiltrated spies into peace organizations, sometimes sent in <em>agents provocateurs</em> to try to get pacifists to do things they could be arrested for, and at even the smallest public antiwar meeting, one of Scotland Yard&#x2019;s dozen shorthand writers would be there taking notes. These agents&#x2019; reports, even those of the <em>agents provocateurs</em> bragging about what they accomplished, are in Britain&#x2019;s National Archives, some of them opened to public view for the first time only in the last few years. </p> <p> (Photo by Spark Media) </p>HMH&nbsp;hardcover, 2011Previous ISBN 978-0-547-19561-2</p><h2>Betty Crocker&#39;s International Cookbook</h2><p>More than 450 carefully chosen recipes from around the world, all of which are adapted to American kitchens and foods, make for economical and nutritious dishes for every meal, every season, and every occasion</p><p></p><h2>Ken Marschall&#39;s Art of the Titanic</h2><p>Ken Marschall delivers a magnificent volume featuring famous paintings, including the image that graced the September 1985 &#34;Time&#34; magazine cover when the underwater remains of the ship were discovered.</p><p></p><h2>Gingerbread Cookie Murder</h2><p>In this merry collection of holiday mysteries, murder is making its own special delivery. . .<br><br><b>"Gingerbread Cookie Murder" By Joanne Fluke</b><br><br>When Hannah Swensen finds her neighbor Ernie Kusak with his head bashed in and sprawled on the floor of his condo next to an upended box of Hannah's Gingerbread Cookies, she discovers a flurry of murder suspects that's as long as her holiday shopping list.<br><br><b>"The Dangers Of Gingerbread Cookies" By Laura Levine</b><br><br>Jaine Austen has been enlisted to help with her parents' retirement community's play The Gingerbread Cookie That Saved Christmas.

Born in the Midwest in 1927 and drawn to France at the tender age of twenty-four, Olney was unapologetically attracted to the style, flavors, and tastes of French cooking when most Americans were smitten by the wonders of the new prepared foods in their markets. With unrelenting passion and precision, Olney studied and explored the cuisine, carefully documenting all he had learned for future generations of chefs, cooks, and food lovers. His first of several landmark works, THE FRENCH MENU COOKBOOK, was well ahead of its time with its authentic French recipes and then-unheard-of seasonal approach to cooking. Little did we know then that THE FRENCH MENU COOKBOOK would provide inspiration for Alice Waters and her compatriots as they built the groundwork for a culinary revolution in America. Brimming with the honest and enlightening explanations of how the French really cook and the 150-plus authentic recipes, this book is a masterful resource that is a must for every serious cook.</p><p>Richard Olney was born and raised in Iowa, one of eight children in a quintessential American family. After relocating to a Parisian suburb in 1951 and then buying a run-down property in Provence, Olney settled in France permanently. The author of eight books, Olney passed away at his Proven�al home in the summer of 1999."Here'�?s a blessing . . . and it'�?s not in disguise." -<i>Newark Star Ledger</i>"The writer to whom Olney immediately demands comparison is Elizabeth David. The prose of each is characterized by an aesthetic sensibility enmeshed in the stabilizing regimen of a strictly imposed self-discipline." -John Thorne, author of <i>Pot on the Fire</i>"Richard Olney is someone who truly lives what he believes-cooking simply from the garden and drinking wonderful wines from the cellar. His FRENCH MENU COOKBOOK is an inspiration, giving a lasting insight into a special way of life." -Alice Waters</p><h2>Gardening with Guineas: A Step-By-Step Guide to Raising Guinea Fowl on a Small Scale</h2><p>Gardening with Guineas is a delightful and informative guide to raising guinea fowl.

As part of the <i>Hidden Treasure Series</i> (which includes Kimball's <i>Hidden Stories of the Childhood of Jesus</i>) this installment offers convincing research suggesting that Herod and Pilate may not have been completely responsible for the death of Jesus. In fact, the authors claim that Pontius Pilate was once revered as a martyred saint (considering that he was blackmailed into condemning Jesus to death and was later killed as a result of the crucifixion). Pilate and his wife Claudia were even recognized on the Christian calendar for 200 years after the death of Christ. The authors also explore a more intricate and lesser-known plot behind Jesus' death. Plus, they discuss evidence that others were resurrected from the dead alongside Jesus. For lay Christians who would like to learn more of the historical truths behind the legend of Christ's life and death, this series is ideal.Glenn Kimball and David Stirland restore for us the forgotten letters of Pontius Pilate, Herod, and the Caesars at the time of the crucifixion of Jesus. There was blackmail in the air and a forgotten belief among those we think might have wanted Him dead. <p>Pilate confesses to taking fifty armed guards into the streets after the crucifixion to find the dead man whom his wife had told him had risen from the dead. The ancient conversation between the resurrected Jesus and Pilate comes out of dusty, forgotten libraries. This is the reason that Pilate and his wife have risen to the status of Sainthood in many religious traditions today. The only thing left for Pilate and his wife to do after Pilate met the resurrected Jesus was to convert to early Christianity. </p><p>Why didn't the rich and Powerful great uncle of Jesus stop the crucifixion and where was he when Jesus was resurrected?

I had walked this route every day for 10 years. I always needed one thing or another, and I liked to walk in the evenings to unwind after 12-hour days working as a plumber. The store stayed open until 10:00 p.m. every night, so it was the perfect destination whenever I wanted some fresh air. These streets were safe, not known for criminal activity, though crazy, in-a-hurry drivers sometimes blew through stop signs or ran red lights.<br><br>I consider myself a pretty observant guy. I was always on the go in my city- -the Bronx--and usually on foot. I had developed a habit of looking both ways when I crossed busy streets.<br><br>But that night was different. Maybe I was lost in my thoughts, thinking about the next day's plumbing job. To be honest, I don't remember walking at all. By the time I realized what was happening, it was already too late.<br><br>I was standing at the curb, about to cross the street, when a car with no lights on came out of nowhere. It plowed into me, and I went hurtling into the air. After I smacked down, my legs, trunk, shoulders, and head skidded on the asphalt. The friction nearly ground my skin and muscle to the bone.<br><br>I didn't see the driver. I couldn't tell you the make, model, or even the color of the car. All I can tell you is that I was 40 years old when I died.<br><br>Up until that horrible accident, I lived a pretty ordinary life. I was born into an Italian-Catholic family. We attended church regularly and observed all the traditional Catholic holidays.<br><br>I grew up in Riverdale, an Irish-Jewish neighborhood in the northwest Bronx. Riverdale is a sliver of land along the Hudson River that sits on hilly ground. Most people think of the Bronx as being a war zone with crime, drugs, and poverty--but not Riverdale. It was a tree-filled place of single-family homes, nice apartments--even mansions--with great views of the river. Riverdale provided a strong sense of community to those of us who grew up there. Today the neighborhood is filled with expensive condos and has become a very trendy place to live.<br><br>I went to Catholic school and was a pretty good student despite not studying much. After school, my friends and I hung out together. Nowadays kids don't go out; they stay glued to computer and TV screens and cell phones. It was sure different back then. With few organized activities and no hovering parents to schedule us, we took to the streets to create our own fun. It was a world of baseball, football, street hockey, and bike riding. We'd get frustrated if cars came by. I developed very muscular calves from riding my bike up and down the hills of Riverdale about an hour and a half every day.<br><br>My family lived in a two-story building, and we occupied the second floor. Next to the building was an empty lot. My friends and I used to play out there all the time. One of the trees had a swing that was a lot of fun. Riverdale was a great place for us kids.<br><br>I'd stay out until five o'clock, when my parents wanted me to come in for supper. My mom was and still is an excellent Italian cook who took great pleasure in making meals for her family. That translates into "Clean up your plate. I worked hard on this meal!" Her rich, sauce-laden dinners; the piles of bread and pasta; and our nightly desserts didn't help my waistline. I had the kind of body that used to be referred to as "husky," which is a polite way of saying "fat." Being an overweight kid made shopping for school clothes a nightmare.<br><br>My old school photos tell the story. Back then, I favored stripes paired with bold, solid colors. So you could say that as a kid, I was fat, not very stylish, and apparently somewhat color-blind.<br><br>During the summer, I'd be sent to the Catholic school camp. But I'd run away. I didn't like structure. I preferred to spend time at the swim club in my neighborhood, where there was an Olympic-size outdoor pool. My friends had the keys to open and close the place, so I got to swim after work. I swam in some local races and even won a few gold medals. The pool was a comfortable place for me. When you're overweight, water keeps you buoyant. Floating in water, you don't feel as big as you do walking on land in a giant body.<br><br>I was always an industrious kid because I liked having my own money, and I wanted to save for a car. When I was 11 years old, I got a paper route. I developed 60 to 70 regular subscribers. They liked my dependability and tipped me well. I had to get up at 5:30 a.m. to prepare my papers for delivery, so I got used to a rigorous work schedule before I was even a teenager. The papers had to be on everyone's doorstep by 7:00 a.m. I learned to work hard and fast, delivering papers by bike and sometimes on foot.<br><br>The newspaper franchise was owned by a man who was an alcoholic. He would drink away all the profits each week. Frustrated, his wife asked me to collect the money, and then lock it up for safekeeping so he couldn't get to it. I did what she asked and gave him only $50 a week. I became the gatekeeper of the profits because she trusted me.<br><br>After my paper route, I would hurry home to get ready for school. I had a long bus ride every morning, and I used that time to cram in any homework I hadn't finished the night before.<br><br>In the winter, the swim club turned into a skating rink. That's where, at age 14, I got my next job. I always loved to work, and I learned how to do every job that needed doing at the rink. I drove the power sweeper, which was great fun. I helped everyone out with their skate rentals. I sold pizza and soda at the concession stand.<br><br>The rink was the popular local hangout. Families from around the neighborhood, both parents and kids, would crowd the rink on the weekends. This was the '70s, and it was a place of carefree escapism. Back then, New York City and the surrounding boroughs were in a state of decline, with cutbacks in quality-of-life services such as the police department, the parks department, and schools. This was the era of the blackouts, too, when the power system of the city just collapsed, and millions of people were plunged into darkness. Looting erupted all over, and many buildings were burned down.<br><br>So people came to the rink to forget and have fun. I can close my eyes and it's like I'm back there. I can still hear the metal blades churning up fresh ice. I can see kids lacing up their skates. I can see girlfriends and boyfriends happily gliding hand in hand to the rich sounds of old-fashioned organ music. No one had to worry about anything. The rink was a respite--a winter wonderland in the middle of an often-chaotic city.<br><br>Through my job at the rink, I discovered that I really liked working with the public. You could say that I'm a people person: I was never too shy to strike up a conversation with a stranger, and I'm like that now. I'll talk to anybody! So it didn't take very long before I knew just about everyone who came to the rink. I enjoyed watching the good skaters practice their tricks on the ice. As for me, I was an awful skater.<br><br>My parents were diligent savers and definitely instilled in me a strong work ethic and sense of independence. They didn't believe in credit and bought only things they could afford to pay for with cash. They raised me to be the same way. I saved all my paper route money. But I knew that if I was going to buy that car someday, I needed to keep my paper route, plus work at the skating rink to speed up my savings plan.<br><br>It worked. Within weeks of getting my driver's license, I bought my dream car: a silver 1976 Mercury Cougar--a real beauty! I paid cash for it with my earnings from both jobs. It felt great to be able to do that. I was so proud of myself for being such a good saver. I've had many cars since then, but that Cougar is my favorite.<br><br>I drove it for a while, but I ended up giving the car to my father because he didn't have a vehicle of his own. My dad had ridden the bus to work every day, without complaint, for as long as I could remember. When I was able to give him that car, it made me feel really good.<br><br>My father worked hard all his life. He had served in the navy, and after World War II, he got a job as an elevator inspector. My mom was employed part-time in a clothing store. My parents rarely missed a day of work. They didn't believe in absenteeism unless you were at death's door. They set a great example for me; I went through high school with a perfect attendance record.<br><br>We didn't have all that much, but I never felt poor. We had nice Christmas holidays and took occasional vacations. Looking back, I marvel at what my parents were able to provide on so little income.<br><br>When I wasn't at school or on the job, I was helping out at home. My parents depended upon me. I was never in trouble, and I always thought of myself as a "good boy."<br><br>When I graduated from high school, it was really time to get to work. I never went to college. I was so busy taking care of things at home that I didn't have the opportunity or time to pursue higher education. For a long time, I had it in the back of my mind that I wanted to enter the priesthood. Ultimately, I decided to go to vocational school and learn the plumbing trade. I knew several plumbers in my neighborhood, and they seemed to do okay. I was good with my hands. I liked people, so plumbing became my trade.<br><br>I enjoyed being a plumber. After a while, I went into business with a longtime friend. I would bid and plan the jobs, and I started to make a decent living. Of course, if you were bidding private jobs, there was monkey business and nepotism to deal with, but I made my fair share, and I liked my work. I was a decent plumber--an average, run-of-the-mill guy trying to do his best every day and help other people out.<br><br>Fortunately, I was able to live near my family and was proud of being able to take care of them, since everyone was getting older. When I was 23, my grandma gave me a little plot of land. I built a house for her there, from the ground up, and paid cash for it. She lived there for only three weeks before she passed away. It was sad, but I was glad to have given her a new home.<br><br>My upbringing had a positive influence on me. That neighborhood, those streets, and those jobs helped form me. It was where family was first, honesty was strength, and the core values were hard work and looking out for one another. Everything about it holds a memory, a life that's dear to me.<br><br>And then I died--and was taken to Heaven.<br><br>I don't remember what happened on that fateful walk, and I definitely don't recall being hit. All those details were filled in for me later by others. According to those who have had similar experiences, it's not uncommon to experience amnesia regarding the events that occur just before you cross over to Heaven.<br><br>I now know that what happened to me can be classified as a near-death experience or NDE. From what I've learned over the years, NDEs have some common elements, though people who have them have their own unique experiences and encounters.<br><br>During my trip to Heaven, I was reunited with loved ones, met angels, got a glimpse of God, and learned divine teachings. I knew it was all true and not a dream or hallucination. But I felt people would think I was nuts if I told them what I saw and experienced there. Well, I did tell my mom, who told our priest, who told her I was crazy! So I kept the experience to myself for many years. I didn't even know why I was chosen to go to Heaven, because I am the most ordinary, down-to-earth guy you'd ever meet.<br><br>Now I know that God wants me to share my story with you, so that you know not only what to expect after this life is over but also how to live in the highest state of health possible, starting today. I will tell you what Heaven looked like to me: the heavenly dwellings; the angels; the flowers and trees; the mountains, lakes, and oceans; the people, babies, and animals; the schools in Heaven; and more. I'll describe my experience to the best of my ability, but anyone who has had a near-death experience will tell you that there are no words in any language that can truly capture the exquisite essence of being in Heaven.<br><br>After I tell you about Heaven, I'm going to explain the eight revelations I was given, one by one, so they can sink into your spirit. A revelation is something that might always have been evident, but few people have seen it or realized it. Sometimes it's an inspiring truth or piece of knowledge given to a person by a divine source. That's what happened to me.<br><br>With each revelation, my dear friend and coauthor, Stephen Sinatra, MD, will tell you, drawing from his expertise, why it is medically and scientifically true. Then we'll give you some action steps and exercises to show you how to apply the revelation to your life.<br><br>The essence of these revelations and Dr. Sinatra's recommendations support the fact that the body, mind, and spirit are all made of energy. Albert Einstein taught this in his quantum physics: that all things are made of vibrating energy.<br><br>If you looked at yourself under a powerful electron microscope, you'd see that you are made up of a cluster of vibrations--moving energy--in the form of atoms. And so is everything else around you--other people, animals, plants, food, and rocks. They all vibrate. So do the cells, organs, and systems in all living organisms.</p><h2>A Red Death</h2><p><p><strong>It's 1953 in Red-baiting, blacklisting Los Angeles, a moral tar pit ready to swallow "Easy Rawlins."</strong></p> Easy is out of " the hurting business" and into the housing (and the favor) business when a racist IRS agent nails him for tax evasion.

It was a three-story pink stucco building between Ninety-first Street and Ninety-first Place, just about a mile outside of Watts proper. Twelve units. All occupied for that month. I had just gathered the dirt into a neat pile when I heard Mofass drive up in his new '53 Pontiac. I knew it was him because there was something wrong with the transmission, you could hear its high singing from a block away. I heard his door slam and his loud hello to Mrs. Trajillo, who always sat at her window on the first floor?best burglar alarm you could have.<br><br>I knew that Mofass collected the late rent on the second Thursday of the month; that's why I chose that particular Thursday to clean. I had money and the law on my mind, and Mofass was the only man I knew who might be able to set me straight.<br><br>I wasn't the only one to hear the Pontiac.<br><br>The doorknob to Apartment J jiggled and the door came open showing Poinsettia Jackson's sallow, sorry face.<br><br>She was a tall young woman with yellowish eyes and thick, slack lips.<br><br>"Hi, Easy," she drawled in the saddest high voice. She was a natural tenor but she screwed her voice higher to make me feel sorry for her.<br><br>All I felt was sick. The open door let the stink of incense from her prayer altar flow out across my newly swept hall.<br><br>"Poinsettia," I replied, then I turned quickly away as if my sweeping might escape if I didn't move to catch it.<br><br>"I heard Mofass down there," she said. "You hear him?"<br><br>"I just been workin'. That's all."<br><br>She opened the door and draped her emaciated body against the jamb. The nightcoat was stretched taut across her chest. Even though Poinsettia had gotten terribly thin after her accident, she still had a large frame.<br><br>"I gotta talk to him, Easy. You know I been so sick that I cain't even walk down there. Maybe you could go on down an tell'im that I need t'talk."<br><br>"He collectin' the late rent, Poinsettia. If you ain't paid him all you gotta do is wait. He'll be up here soon enough to talk to you."<br><br>"But I don't have it," she cried.<br><br>"You better tell'im that," I said. It didn't mean anything, I just wanted to say the last word and get down to work on the second floor.<br><br>"Could you talk to him, Easy? Couldn't you tell'im how sick I am?"<br><br>"He know how sick you are, Poinsettia. All he gotta do is look at you and he could tell that. But you know Mofass is business. He wants that rent."<br><br>"But maybe you could tell him about me, Easy."<br><br>She smiled at me. It was the kind of smile that once made men want to go out of their way. But Poinsettia's fine skin had slackened and she smelled like an old woman, even with the incense and perfume. Instead of wanting to help her I just wanted to get away.<br><br>"Sure, I'll ask 'im. But you know he don't work for me," I lied. "It's the other way around."<br><br>"Go on down there now, Easy," she begged. "Go ask 'im to let me slide a month or two."<br><br>She hadn't paid a penny in four months already, but it wouldn't have been smart for me to say that to her.<br><br>"Lemme talk to 'im later, Poinsettia. He'd just get mad if I stopped him on the steps."<br><br>"Go to 'im now, Easy. I hear him coming." She pulled at her robe with frantic fingers.<br><br>I could hear him too. Three loud knocks on a door, probably unit B, and then, in his deep voice, "Rent!"<br><br>"I'll go on down," I said to Poinsettia's ashen toes.<br><br>I pushed the dirt into my long-handled dustpan and made my way down to the second floor, sweeping off each stair as I went. I had just started gathering the dirt into a pile when Mofass came struggling up the stairs.<br><br>He'd lean forward to grab the railing, then pull himself up the stairs, hugging and wheezing like an old bulldog.<br><br>Mofass looked like an old bulldog too; a bulldog in a three-piece brown suit. He was fat but powerfully built, with low sloping shoulders and thick arms. He always had a cigar in his mouth or between his broad fingers. His color was dark brown but bright, as if a powerful lamp shone just below his skin.<br><br>"Mr. Rawlins," Mofass said to me. He made sure to be respectful when talking to anyone. Even if I actually had been his cleanup man he would have called me mister.<br><br>"Mofass," I said back. That was the only name he let anyone call him. "I need to discuss something with you after I finish here. Maybe we could go somewhere and have some lunch."<br><br>"Suits me," he said, clamping down on his cigar.<br><br>He grabbed the rail to the third floor and began to pull himself up there.<br><br>I went back to my work and worry.<br><br>Each floor of the Magnolia Street building had a short hallway with two apartments on either side. At the far end was a large window that let in the morning sun. That's why I fell in love with the place. The morning sun shone in, warming up the cold concrete floors and brightening the first part of your day. Sometimes I'd go there even when there was no work to be done. Mrs. Trajillo would stop me at the front door and ask, "Something wrong with the plumbing, Mr. Rawlins?" And I'd tell her that Mofass had me checking on the roof or that Lily Brown had seen a mouse a few weeks back and I was checking the traps. It was always best if I said something about a rodent or bugs, because Mrs. Trajillo was a sensitive woman who couldn't stand the idea of anything crawling down around the level of her feet.<br><br>Then I'd go upstairs and stand in the window, looking down into the street. Sometimes I'd stand there for an hour and more, watching the cars and clouds making their ways. There was a peaceful feeling about the streets of Los Angeles in those days.<br><br>Everybody on the second floor had a job, so I could sit around the halls all morning and nobody would bother me.<br><br>But that was all over. Just one letter from the government had ended my good life.<br><br>Everybody thought I was the handyman and that Mofass collected the rent for some white lady downtown. I owned three buildings, the Magnolia Street place being the largest, and a small house on 116th Street. All I had to do was the maintenance work, which I liked because whenever you hired somebody to work for you they always took too long and charged too much. And when I wasn't doing that I could do my little private job.<br><br>On top of real estate I was in the business of favors. I'd do something for somebody, like find a missing husband or figure out who's been breaking into so-and-so's store, and then maybe they could do me a good turn one day. It was a real country way of doing business. At that time almost everybody in my neighborhood had come from the country around southern Texas and Louisiana.<br><br>People would come to me if they had serious trouble but couldn't go to the police. Maybe somebody stole their money or their illegally registered car. Maybe they worried about their daughter's company or a wayward son. I settled disputes that would have otherwise come to bloodshed. I had a reputation for fairness and the strength of my convictions among the poor. Ninety-nine out of a hundred black folk were poor back then, so my reputation went quite a way.<br><br>I wasn't on anybody's payroll, and even though the rent was never steady, I still had enough money for food and liquor.<br><br>"What you mean, not today?" Mofass's deep voice echoed down the stairs. After that came the strained cries of Poinsettia.<br><br>"Cryin' ain't gonna pay the rent, Miss Jackson."<br><br>"I ain't got it! You know I ain't got it an' you know why too!"<br><br>"I know you ain't got it, that's why I'm here. This ain't my reg'lar collectin' day, ya know. I come to tell you folks that don't pay up, the gravy train is busted."<br><br>"I can't pay ya, Mofass. I ain't got it and I'm sick."<br><br>"Lissen here." His voice dropped a little. "This is my job. My money comes from the rent I collect fo' Mrs. Davenport. You see, I bring her a stack'a money from her buildin's and then she counts it. And when she finishes countin' she takes out my little piece. Now when I bring her more money I get more, and when I bring in less..."<br><br>Mofass didn't finish, because Poinsettia started crying.<br><br>"Let me loose!" Mofass shouted. "Let go, girl!"<br><br>"But you promised!" Poinsettia cried. "You promised!"<br><br>"I ain't promised nuthin'! Let go now!"<br><br>A few moments later I could hear him coming down the stairs.<br><br>"I be back on Saturday, and if you ain't got the money then you better be gone!" he shouted.<br><br>"You can go to hell!" Poinsettia cried in a strong tenor voice. "You shitty-assed bastard! I'ma call Willie on yo' black ass. He know all about you! Willie chew yo' shitty ass off!"<br><br>Mofass came down the stair holding on to the rail. He was walking slowly amid the curses and screams. I wondered if he even heard them.<br><br>"bastard!!" shouted Poinsettia.<br><br>"Are you ready to leave, Mr. Rawlins?" he asked me.<br><br>"I got the first floor yet."<br><br>"Mothahfuckin' bastard!"<br><br>"I'll be out in the car then. Take your time." Mofass waved his cigar in the air, leaving a peaceful trail of blue smoke.<br><br>When the front door on the first floor closed, Poinsettia stopped shouting and slammed her own door. Everything was quiet again. The sun was still warming the concrete floor and everything was as beautiful as always.<br><br>But it wasn't going to last long. Soon Poinsettia would be in the street and I'd have the morning sun in my jail cell.<br><br>Copyright � 2002 by Walter Mosley</p><h2>Blood Music</h2><p>The Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author of <i>Moving Mars </i>presents the book that launched his career, featuring a scientist who conducts an experiment in cell restructuring that takes on a threatening life of its own.

In concise, easily understood prose, James W. Sire explained the basics of theism, deism, naturalism, nihilism, existentialism, Eastern monism and the new consciousness. The second edition was updated and expanded to include sections on Marxism and secular humanism, as well as a completely reworked chapter on what is now widely known as New Age philosophy rather than new consciousness. And the third edition offered further updating and revisions, including a thoroughly revised chapter on New Age philosophy and, perhaps most importantly, a new chapter on postmodernism. Now the fourth edition refines the definition of worldview itself, incorporating Sire&#39;s thinking and teaching during the past decade. (His recent work is showcased in a new book, Naming the Elephant, also published by IVP.) The Universe Next Door has been translated into several languages and has been used as a text at over one hundred colleges and universities in courses ranging from apologetics and world religions to history and English literature. With the publication of the fourth edition, this book will continue to aid students, teachers and anyone who wants to understand the variety of worldviews that compete with Christianity for the allegiance of our minds and hearts.</p><p>IVP: Describe the difference between your two worldview books, Naming the Elephant and The Universe Next Door. <p>James Sire: The Universe Next Door is a basic catalog of worldviews--that is, of the primary ways people have viewed reality. In part the book is a work of popular intellectual history. It begins with Christian theism, the worldview dominant in the seventeenth century and very much alive today, and shows how subsequent worldviews (deism, naturalism, nihilism, existentialism) developed from theism, and then how Eastern pantheism, New Age thought and postmodernism have emerged to further complicate the pluralistic character of our Western culture. The book is also a work to help individuals understand their own worldview and why they think it is true. The Universe Next Door is not itself an apologetic for the Christian faith, but it provides much of the material from which an apologetic can be constructed by those who think through its implications. A short answer to the question of why I wrote this book in the first place is in its epigraph: "For any of us to be fully conscious intellectually we should not only be able to detect the worldviews of others but be aware of our own--why it is ours and why in light of so many options we think it is true." </p><p>Naming the Elephant: Worldview as a Concept asks, What exactly is a worldview? It takes the largely intellectual concept I first formulated in The Universe Next Door in 1976 and asks whether it is still adequate. As a result of this analysis, I offer a revised definition that preserves the importance of the intellect but identifies the essence of a worldview as a matter of the heart--the central control room of the human being--rather than solely as a matter of the mind. The final chapter suggests ways in which worldview analysis can benefit us and our culture.</p>James W.

David W. Shaw, who brings decades of experience as a seaman to his writing, has based this riveting tale on the firsthand testimony of the few who survived the wreck, including its heroic captain, James C. Luce. It is the story of the brave and dutiful Luce fighting his mutinous crew as they take the lifeboats, leaving hundreds of men, women, and children to suffer a cruel and painful death. It is also the story of those who survived the frigid waters and those who perished -- including Luce&#39;s own frail son, who died as the grief-stricken captain helplessly watched. Not only did 400 people die by daybreak, the wreck brought to an end the domination of the seas by the American maritime fleet. Utterly compelling, beautifully written, and a fascinating, heretofore little-known slice of American history, The Sea Shall Embrace Them is a stirring narrative that puts the reader on the deck as a shipful of men, women, and children do battle both with a mighty ocean and with their own baser instincts to survive.</p><p>By the mid-19th century, steamships were eclipsing traditional sailing ships in the lucrative transatlantic trade. The largest of these, the American <i>Arctic</i>, collided with a smaller vessel in 1854 with a frightful, and unnecessary, loss of life. David W. Shaw's <i>The Sea Shall Embrace Them</i> tells the story of this disaster, eerily similar in many ways to the later sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>. Shaw lays out the immediate and secondary causes of the disaster: bad weather, no established shipping lanes, the ship's owners' preference for speed rather than prudence, and an appalling lack of safety precautions. As well, he describes the suffering and grotesque deaths of many aboard and dozens of acts of pure cowardice on the part of the crew. The writing for the most part is vivid and effective, though the physical layout of the ship is somewhat murky. The story of the <i>Arctic</i> is not only sad and the tragedy avoidable, but one that, as Shaw points out, would be repeated many times in the decades to follow. <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i><b>David W. Shaw</b> brings decades of experience as a seaman to his writing. The author of <i>Inland Passage, Daring the Sea,</i> and <i>Flying Cloud,</i> Shaw writes extensively for yachting magazines.

Foremost, she attacks the notion that low-wage jobs require &#34;unskilled&#34; labor. The author, a journalist with a Ph.D. in cell biology, found manual labor taxing, uninteresting and degrading. She says that the work required incredible feats of stamina, focus, memory, quick thinking, and fast learning. Constant and repeated movement creates a risk of repetitive stress injury, pain must often be worked through to hold a job in a market with constant turnover; and the days are filled with degrading and uninteresting tasks (e.g. toilet-cleaning and shirt-reordering). She also details several individuals in management roles who served mainly to interfere with worker productivity, force employees to undertake pointless tasks, and make the entire low-wage work experience even more miserable. She claims &#34;personality&#34; tests, questionnaires designed to weed out &#34;incompatible&#34; potential employees, and urine drug tests, increasingly common in the low wage market, deter potential applicants and violate liberties while having little tangible positive effect on work performance. She reports that &#34;help needed&#34; signs don&#39;t necessarily indicate an opening; more often their purpose is to sustain a pool of applicants to safeguard against rapid turnover of employees. She also argues one low wage job is often not enough to support one person (let alone a family); with inflating housing prices and stagnant wages, this practice increasingly becomes difficult to maintain. Many of the workers encountered in the book survive by living with relatives or other persons in the same position, or even in their vehicles.</p><p></p><h2>Matisse&#39;s Garden</h2><p>One day, the French artist Henri Matisse cut a small bird out of a piece of paper. It looked lonely all by itself, so he cut out more shapes to join it. Before he knew it, Matisse had transformed his walls into larger-than-life gardens, filled with brightly colored plants, animals, and shapes of all sizes! Featuring cut-paper illustrations and interactive foldout pages, <i>Matisse&#x2019;s Garden</i> is the inspiring story of how the artist&#x2019;s never-ending curiosity helped turn a small experiment into a radical new form of art.</p><p><p>Samantha Friedman is an assistant curator in the Department of Drawings and Prints at The Museum of Modern Art in New York. She is a contributing author of many books on art. </p><p>Cristina Amodeo is an illustrator and graphic designer based in Milan, Italy. </p><p>Henri Matisse (1869&#x2013;1954), one of modern art&#x2019;s most important figures, was a painter, draftsman, sculptor, and printmaker who began creating paper cutouts in the 1940s.</p>&nbsp;<p></p>Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;Seemingly on a whim one day, artist Henri Matisse cut a bird out of white paper, pinned it on his wall, and created a brand-new art form. Eight of his cut-paper works, some appearing as gatefolds, are reproduced in this charming, kid-friendly informational picture book that briefly describes how Matisse began working in his new style and how it and he soared as a result. Amodeo fully captures Matisse's inventive joy with her cut-paper illustrations, which work beautifully with the text and pop from the pages with brilliant, vivid colors, and kinetic energy. In a whimsical spread, the illustrator depicts the man flying to demonstrate how unfettered he felt as his scissors glided effortlessly through paper. Having started with white paper, Matisse eventually asked his assistants to paint paper against which to set his ever-larger cutouts that culminated in a studio "garden." (In a delightful touch, the assistants are shown in a scene reminiscent of the artist's La Danse.) Kids get cut- (or torn-) paper art intuitively and love playing with bright colors when creating their own masterpieces, and they'll appreciate that this book validates their own ideas about the freedom that comes with artistic experimentation. A brief biographical paragraph and material about the artworks close out the book. This title also makes for a great read-aloud before collage projects and in art units on major artists and color theory.

And you can, too. Here in one volume are two classic works by Brother Lawrence. Each book reveals how to practice God's presence and see His glory in every facet of your life. <br><br><i>The Practice of the Presence of God </i>is a collection of documented conversations and letters that reveal the heart of this humble man. He wrote, "The time of business does not with me differ from the time of prayer, and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen . . . I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament." <br><br>Brother Lawrence's wisdom and spiritual insights have helped bring people closer to God for more than three centuries. <i>The Spiritual Maxims of Brother Lawrence, </i>a lesser known but equally outstanding work, is a summary of his teachings. Throughout, he develops one great theme, best expressed by the psalmist, "In Thy Presence is fulness of joy."<b>Brother Lawrence (1614 - 1691)</b><br><br> Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection (c. 1614 &#x2013; 12 February 1691) served as a lay brother in a Carmelite monastery in Paris.

O. Wilson, and James Gleick, The Ghost Map is a riveting page-turner with a real-life historical hero that brilliantly illuminates the intertwined histories of the spread of viruses, rise of cities, and the nature of scientific inquiry. These are topics that have long obsessed Steven Johnson, and The Ghost Map is a true triumph of the kind of multidisciplinary thinking for which he&#39;s become famous-a book that, like the work of Jared Diamond, presents both vivid history and a powerful and provocative explanation of what it means for the world we live in. The Ghost Map takes place in the summer of 1854. A devastating cholera outbreak seizes London just as it is emerging as a modern city: more than 2 million people packed into a ten-mile circumference, a hub of travel and commerce, teeming with people from all over the world, continually pushing the limits of infrastructure that&#39;s outdated as soon as it&#39;s updated. Dr. John Snow-whose ideas about contagion had been dismissed by the scientific community-is spurred to intense action when the people in his neighborhood begin dying. With enthralling suspense, Johnson chronicles Snow&#39;s day-by-day efforts, as he risks his own life to prove how the epidemic is being spread. When he creates the map that traces the pattern of outbreak back to its source, Dr. Snow didn&#39;t just solve the most pressing medical riddle of his time. He ultimately established a precedent for the way modern city-dwellers, city planners, physicians, and public officials think about the spread of disease and the development of the modern urban environment. The Ghost Map is an endlessly compelling and utterly gripping account of that London summer of 1854, from the microbial level to the macrourban-theory level-including, most important, the human level.</p><p></p><h2>Mouse Guard: Legends of the Guard Volume 1 (4)</h2><p>Inside the June Alley Inn, located in the western mouse city of Barkstone, mice gather to tell tales, each trying to outdo the other. A competition, of sorts, begins. The rules: Every story must contain one truth, one lie and have never been told in that tavern before. With the winner getting his bar tab cleared, fantastic stories are spun throughout the evening. Legends of the Guard is a new Mouse Guard anthology series featuring the work of artists and storytellers handpicked by series creator David Petersen, including Jeremy Bastian (Cursed Pirate Girl), Alex Sheikman (Robotika), Ted Naifeh (Courtney Crumrin and the Night Things), Gene Ha (Top 10), Sean Rubin (Redwall), Guy Davis (B.P.R.D.), Katie Cook (Fraggle Rock), Karl Kerschl (Teen Titans: Year One), Craig Rousseau (Impulse), and Mark Smylie (Artesia).</p><p>David Petersen was born in 1977. His artistic career soon followed. A steady diet of cartoons, comics and tree climbing fed his imagination and is what still inspires his work today. David was the 2007 Russ Manning Award recipient for Most Promising Newcomer, and in 2008 won Eisner Awards for Best Publication for Kids (Mouse Guard: Fall 1152 &amp; Winter 1152) and Best Graphic Album &#x2013; Reprint (Mouse Guard: Fall 1152 Hardcover). He received his BFA in Printmaking from Eastern Michigan University where he met his wife Julia. They continue to reside in Michigan with their dog AutumnCreator Petersen turns to the tested and reliable bar story as a framing device to allow other writers and artists to play in his Mouse Guard universe, where heroic mice heroes are set in a world of epic fantasy. The June Alley Inn attracts a colorful and varied clientele. One night barkeep June decides to take advantage of this and stages a story-telling contest. What follows are thirteen tales of danger and adventure, as protagonists contend against the predators around them and the flaws that divide mouse from mouse. Armed with medieval technology but vulnerable due to their tiny size, the mice are as daring as any human, and as determined as any full sized protagonist. Petersen's selection is skillful and apt; each writer and artist brings skill and respect for the source material to the individual stories, illuminating Petersen's world rather than using it as a mere palimpsest on which to indulge their own obsessions.

It was the launching pad for Hitler's empire, the embodiment of his vision of a world metropolis.&#x201d; Berlin was also the place where Hitler's Reich would ultimately fall. Berlin suffered more air raids than any other German city and endured the full force of a Soviet siege.<p>In <i>Berlin at War</i>, historian Roger Moorhouse uses diaries, memoirs, and interviews to provide a searing first-hand account of life and death in the Nazi capital the privations, the hopes and fears, and the nonconformist tradition that saw some Berliners provide underground succour to the city's remaining Jews. Combining comprehensive research with gripping narrative, <i>Berlin at War</i> is the incredible story of the city and people that saw the whole of World War Two.</p></p><p><b>Roger Moorhouse</b> is a regular contributor to <i>BBC History Magazine</i>. He is the author of <i>Killing Hitler: The Plots, the Assassins, and the Dictator Who Cheated Death</i>, and coauthor with Norman Davies of <i>Microcosm: Portrait of a Central European City</i>. He lives in Buckinghamshire, England.<b><i>History Today</i> (UK)<br></b>&#x201c;[A]s readable as a first-rate novel, full of gripping stories of suffering, endurance, courage and cowardice. Moorhouse is a clear-eyed, sensible and balanced historian who has substantially added to our knowledge of what happens when a society falls apart.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>The Bloomsbury Review<br></i></b>&#x201c;[A] detailed exploration of daily life in the sprawling capital of an enemy during wartime. Mundane activity...takes on a zestier level of interest as it unfolds within the grounds of a heavily targeted bomb zone.... More than a half century after this world war ended, Germany&#x2019;s former position as an enemy has faded.

A good many loathed Hitler and all he stood for; some risked torture and death to save Jews; the majority toed the line, not so much because they were ardent Nazis as because they were Germans who instinctively cleaved to the rule of law and just didn&#x2019;t like to rock the boat.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Max Hastings,&nbsp;<i>Sunday Times</i>&nbsp;(UK)</b>&#x201c;Roger Moorhouse has deep knowledge of wartime Germany...[and] a nice eye for social detail....

Moorhouse is particularly good with the small-arms fire of history, those illuminating details or unknown life-stories that shed light on a phenomenon of Berlin life.... By trawling through the complex, often deeply morally compromised personal stories of many survivors, Moorhouse has produced new insights into the way ordinary Berliners tried to escape the disastrous ill-fortune of living in the belly of the beast.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<b>Andrew Roberts, author of&nbsp;<i>Masters and Commanders: How Four Titans Won the War in the West, 1941-1945</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In Berlin at War, Roger Moorhouse provides a painstakingly detailed account of everyday life in Hitler&#x2019;s metropolis from 1939 to the conflict&#x2019;s end....Using a variety of sources ranging from unpublished memoirs to interviews, Moorhouse builds an absorbing picture of hardship and despair in the nerve centre of Nazi Germany....As a leading historian of modern Germany, Moorhouse has chronicled a largely unknown story with scholarship, narrative verve and, at times, an awful, harrowing immediacy.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Herald</i>&nbsp;(Scotland)</b>&#x201c;Intelligent and absorbing....This is very much a people&#x2019;s history where the backbone of the narrative has not been supplied by the wider military progress of the war but by the response of many ordinary Berliners.

But few of us realize how much more dramatic and extreme our bodies' reactions to emotions can be. Many people who see their doctor have medically unexplained symptoms, and in the vast majority of these cases, a psychosomatic cause is suspected. And yet, the diagnosis of a psychosomatic disorder can make a patient feel dismissed as a hypochondriac, a faker, or just plain crazy.<br> &nbsp;<br> In IS IT ALL IN YOUR HEAD? neurologist Suzanne O'Sullivan, MD, takes us on a journey through the world of psychosomatic illness, where we meet patients such as Rachel, a promising young dancer now housebound by chronic fatigue syndrome, and Mary, whose memory loss may be her mind's way of protecting her from remembering her husband's abuse. O'Sullivan reveals the hidden stresses behind their mysterious symptoms, approaching a sensitive topic with patience and understanding. She addresses the taboos surrounding psychosomatic disorders, teaching us that "it's all in your head" doesn't mean that something isn't real, as the body is often the stand-in for the mind when the latter doesn't possess the tools to put words to its sorrow. <br><br>The perfect book for fans of Oliver Sacks, <i>Is It All in Your Head?</i> encourages us to look with compassion at the ways in which our brains act out, and to acknowledge the intimate connection between mind and body.</p><p><b>Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan</b> has been a consultant in neurology since 2004, working first at The Royal London Hospital and currently as a consultant in clinical neurophysiology and neurology at The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, as well as for a specialist unit based at the Epilepsy Society.

Psychosomatic illness is not fully understood, but stress and traumatic events, such as rape and domestic violence, are suspected to be a cause. That may be why it is more common in women than men. Ms. O&#x2019;Sullivan unravels her patients&#x2019; past to explain how memories lodged in the subconscious&#x2014;from a child&#x2019;s death to a broken bone&#x2014;can command debilitating physical illness, in some cases many years later. Psychosomatic diseases are ubiquitous and cost health systems a fortune (twice the cost of treating diabetes in America in 2002, for example), yet medical textbooks relegate them to footnotes. Patients reject the diagnosis as laden with stigma. Ms. O&#x2019;Sullivan&#x2019;s book is a plea for change.

O&#x2019;Sullivan makes the powerful argument for taking psychosomatic illnesses seriously and treating the people who suffer from them with respect. This last point is especially critical: Psychosomatic diagnosis carry with them a stigma that can make treatment much harder for patient and physician alike. O&#x2019;Sullivan wants us to understand that these conditions are real&#x2014;just as real as laughing or crying or any other ways our bodies &#x2018;somatize&#x2019; emotions.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;</i><b><b><i>BOOKFORUM<br></i></b></b><br>&#x201c;In this important book,&nbsp;O&#x2019;Sullivan&nbsp;lays out her case for a new approach and treatment methods for psychosomatic illness. Her argument is convincing. Taken from real life experiences, through her work as a neurologist and neurophysiologist, she shares the cases of some of her patients and ponders how come so many of them complain about symptoms without any physical manifestation... O&#x2019;Sullivan&nbsp;seeks to establish a connection between mind and body that goes beyond simple mood disorder treatment. She advocates for new ways to look, understand and treat unexplainable symptoms, paving the way for bringing relief to her patients.

Frequently, the recourse prescribed is psychiatric intervention in an attempt to expose underlying mental conflicts that may have triggered the disability. Earlier psychologists such as Charcot, Janet, Breuer, Munchhausen, and of course Freud are threaded into the story along with discussions of hysteria, conversion disorder, dissociation, and more timely terms. . .

He was also chairman of the Republican National Committee, the 1976 Republican nominee for vice president, and the 1996 Republican nominee for president. He is currently serving as the chairman of the World War II Memorial campaign and as chairman of the International Commission on Missing Persons in Bosnia.

Letterman asked Dole about President Clinton's weight, but Dole wasn't taking the bait. "I never tried to lift him," he retorted. "I just tried to beat him." That was the first time many Americans got to see a side of Bob Dole rarely revealed to the public during his 36 years on Capitol Hill--the dry, wicked sense of humor that quickly became a defining characteristic of his postpolitical career.<p> <i>Great Political Wit</i> collects some of Bob Dole's favorite humorous anecdotes about American politicians--and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who gets most of the handful of truly savage putdowns. (Told by one female member of the House of Commons that he was drunk, Churchill replied, "You're ugly, and tomorrow morning I'll be sober, but you'll still be ugly.") If you like the "Laughter Is the Best Medicine" section of <i>Reader's Digest</i>, the stories about pols like Ronald Reagan, Tip O'Neill, and Woodrow Wilson are sure to make you smile.

The Gold Rush has ended; the Civil War threatens to tear apart the country. Far from the front lines, the city at the western edge roars. A global seaport, home to immigrants from five continents, San Francisco has become a complex urban society virtually overnight. The bards of the moment are the Bohemians: a young Mark Twain, fleeing the draft and seeking adventure; literary golden boy Bret Harte; struggling gay poet Charles Warren Stoddard; and beautiful, haunted Ina Coolbrith, poet and protectorate of the group. Ben Tarnoff&#x2019;s elegant, atmospheric history reveals how these four pioneering western writers would together create a new American literature, unfettered by the heavy European influence that dominated the East.<br><br>Twain arrives by stagecoach in San Francisco in 1863 and is fast drunk on champagne, oysters, and the city&#x2019;s intoxicating energy. He finds that the war has only made California richer: the economy booms, newspapers and magazines thrive, and the dream of transcontinental train travel promises to soon become a reality. Twain and the Bohemians find inspiration in their surroundings: the dark ironies of frontier humor, the extravagant tales told around the campfires, and the youthful irreverence of the new world being formed in the west. The star of the moment is Bret Harte, a rising figure on the national scene and mentor to both Stoddard and Coolbrith. Young and ambitious, Twain and Harte form the Bohemian core. But as Harte&#x2019;s star ascends&#x2014;drawing attention from eastern taste makers such as the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>&#x2014;Twain flounders, questioning whether he should be a writer at all.<br>&nbsp;<p>The Bohemian moment would continue in Boston, New York, and London, and would achieve immortality in the writings of Mark Twain. San Francisco gave him his education as a writer and helped inspire the astonishing innovations that radically reimagined American literature.

It ended with the death of 750,000 soldiers and a nation shaken to its core. The wise men of an earlier era found themselves entirely unequal to the crisis. The great political and military leaders of the past&#x2014;eminences like John Crittenden and General Winfield Scott, both born in the previous century&#x2014;went into forced retirement, while younger, more modern minds like Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant rose to the challenge. The Civil War destroyed old assumptions and rewarded radically new thinking. It triggered a cultural upheaval comparable to the one wrought a century later by the Vietnam War, a national trauma that made an older generation suddenly obsolete and demanded novelty, innovation, experimentation. The 1860s was bloody, bewildering&#x2014;and, if you managed to survive, a magnificent time to be a young American.</p><p>If America belonged to the young, then its future lay in the youngest place in America: the Far West. The pioneers who settled it were overwhelmingly young, and untethered from traditional society, they built a new world without the benefit of their parents&#x2019; counsel. If their encampments often reeled with postadolescent excess, they also offered opportunities unlike any that might be found in the colleges and countinghouses of the East. These new Americans were the &#x201c;tan-faced children&#x201d; of Walt Whitman&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;Pioneers! O Pioneers,&#x201d; the vanguard of democracy:</p><p>All the past we leave behind;</p><p>We debouch upon a newer, mightier world, varied world,</p><p>Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march,</p><p>Pioneers! O pioneers!</p><p>When Whitman looked West, he didn&#x2019;t just see a place. He saw an idea, rooted in a mystical tradition as old as the country itself. Thomas Jefferson had been its founding prophet. He and his disciples believed that American civilization would march inevitably toward the Pacific, and that the continent&#x2019;s limitless supply of virgin land would be settled by yeoman farmers who embodied the nation&#x2019;s egalitarian spirit. Of course, the reality was often more complicated. The region contained land that resisted cultivation, and Indians who resisted extermination. But as the line of settlement inched steadily forward&#x2014;past the Alleghenies, then the Mississippi, then the Rockies&#x2014;the Jeffersonian dream of a westward &#x201c;empire of liberty&#x201d; began to look like prophecy. Even Henry David Thoreau, when departing for his daily walk in Concord, felt drawn in a westerly direction. &#x201c;The future lies that way to me,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side.&#x201d;</p><p>Mark Twain was born in 1835 and reached young adulthood at the best possible time, just as the country embarked on the most extraordinary period of change in its history. He was a westerner by birth, raised on the Missouri frontier. The outbreak of the Civil War forced him farther west, as he fled the fighting in his native state for the region beyond the Rockies. There he found another frontier&#x2014;and a social experiment unlike any in the country. In 1848, the discovery of gold in California had triggered a swift influx of people from all corners of the world. As the gateway to the gold rush, San Francisco went from a drowsy backwater to a booming global seaport. Mostly the newcomers were young, single men&#x2014;they hadn&#x2019;t come to stay, but to get rich and get out. They erected tents and wooden hovels, makeshift structures that made easy kindling for the city&#x2019;s frequent fires. They built gambling dens and saloons and brothels. They lived among the cultures of five continents, often condensed into the space of a single street: Cantonese stir-fry competing with German wurst, Chilean whores with Australian. On the far margin of the continent, they created a complex urban society virtually overnight.</p><p>By the time Twain got there, San Francisco still roared. It was densely urban, yet unmistakably western; isolated yet cosmopolitan; crude yet cultured. The city craved spectacle, whether on the gaslit stages of its many theaters or in the ornately costumed pageantry of its streets. Its wide-open atmosphere endeared it to the young and the odd, to anyone seeking refuge from the overcivilized East. It had an acute sense of its own history, and a paganish appetite for mythmaking and ritual. Even as the gold rush waned, and the miners&#x2019; shanties became banks and restaurants and boutiques, the city didn&#x2019;t slow to a more settled rhythm. Rather, it financed the opening of new frontiers&#x2014;in Nevada, Idaho, and elsewhere&#x2014;and leaped from one bonanza to the next. Its citizens spent lavishly: on feasts of oysters and terrapin, on imported fashions and furnishings. They drank seven bottles of champagne for every one drunk in Boston. Long after the gold rush, they kept the frontier spirit of the city alive.</p><p>They also sustained a thriving publishing culture. California was always crawling with scribblers. The first generation wrote the story of the gold rush themselves, in letters and diaries and in the pages of the newspapers they started as soon as they arrived. San Francisco&#x2019;s printing presses cranked out pamphlets, periodicals, and books, relieving the loneliness and boredom of the frontier. By the 1860s, the city had spawned an extraordinary literary scene&#x2014;a band of outsiders called the Bohemians. Twain joined their ranks, and the encounter would shape the entire current of his life.</p><p>Bret Harte was their leader. Immaculately dressed and witheringly ironic, he didn&#x2019;t mix easily with others. He held himself apart, and hated the mediocrity of most California writing. In the gold rush, he would discover material that met his exacting standards: tales of the frontier, infused with dark humor and colorful slang. These would feed the country&#x2019;s growing fascination with the Far West, and catapult him to the top spot in American letters. He drew other young Californians into his orbit, helping them grow into writers capable of seizing the national stage.</p><p>Charles Warren Stoddard needed the encouragement. Dreamy and frail, he always doubted himself. He was what his idol and sometime correspondent, Walt Whitman, would call &#x201c;adhesive&#x201d;&#x2014;gay&#x2014;and he struggled to square his sexuality with a world that offered few outlets for it. He buried himself in poetry and became the boy wonder of the Bohemians. But his real breakthrough came when he traveled to the South Seas, where he discovered a tropical paradise that sated his sensuality and inspired his best writing.</p><p>Ina Coolbrith also suffered for her secrets. A painful past had forced her to live outside the narrow mold of Victorian womanhood, and she was determined to make the most of it. She earned recognition from an early age for her poetry, and later became the first poet laureate of California. To the Bohemians, she provided companionship, sympathy, and support that proved indispensable to the growth of the group. She also gave them a place to gather, in the parlor of her parents&#x2019; house.</p><p>The Bohemians were nonconformists by choice or by circumstance, and they eased their isolation by forming intense friendships with one another. San Francisco was where their story began, but it would continue in Boston, New York, and London; in the palace and the poorhouse; in success and humiliation, fame and poverty. They benefited from the disruptions of the 1860s, as the Civil War shattered the moral certainties of antebellum America and created rifts in the culture wide enough for new voices to be heard. At the same time, the war made America smaller. It connected California to the rest of the country with railroad track and telegraph wire, and fostered a spirit of nationalism that brought East and West closer together. San Francisco emerged from its seclusion, and its writers found a wider readership at a moment when the nation sorely needed new storytellers.</p><p>The Bohemians would bring a fresh spirit to American writing, drawn from the new world being formed in the Far West. If the old guard of American literature was genteel, moralistic, grandiose, then the Bohemians would be ironic and irreverent. They would prefer satire to sermons, sensuality to sentimentalism. They would embrace the devilish sense of humor that flourished in the communities of the frontier. Above all, they would help break the literary monopoly of the East. The Bohemians would prove that the Pacific coast could produce literature on a par with the Atlantic&#x2014;that the Far West wasn&#x2019;t a backwater but a civilization of its own, capable of creating great art.</p><p>No Bohemian made better art than Twain. San Francisco gave him his education as a writer, nurturing the literary powers he would later use to transform American literature. He would help steer the country through its newfangled nationhood, and become the supreme cultural icon of the postwar age. But first, he would spend his formative years on the Far Western fringe, in the company of other young Bohemians struggling to reinvent American writing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PIONEERS</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Mark Twain in 1863, taken on his first visit to San Francisco. He was twenty-seven.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>What people remembered best about him, aside from his brambly red brows and rambling gait, was his strange way of speaking: a drawl that spun syllables slowly, like fallen branches on the surface of a stream. Printers transcribed it with hyphens and dashes, trying to render rhythms so complex they could&#x2019;ve been scored as sheet music. He rasped and droned, lapsed into long silences, soared in the swaying tenor inherited from the slave songs of his childhood. He made people laugh while remaining dreadfully, imperially serious. He mixed the sincere and the satiric, the factual and the fictitious, in proportions too obscure for even his closest friends to decipher. He was prickly, irreverent, ambitious, vindictive&#x2014;a personality as impenetrably vast as the American West, and as prone to seismic outbursts. He was Samuel Clemens before he became Mark Twain, and in the spring of 1863, he made a decision that brought him one step closer to the fame he craved.</p><p>On May 2, 1863, Mark Twain boarded a stagecoach bound for San Francisco. The trip from Virginia City, Nevada, to the California coast promised more than two hundred miles of jolting terrain: sleepless nights spent corkscrewing through the Sierras, and alkali dust so thick it caked the skin. These discomforts didn&#x2019;t deter the young Twain, who, at twenty-seven, already had more interesting memories than most men twice his age. He had piloted steamboats on the Mississippi, roamed his native Missouri with a band of Confederate guerrillas, and as the Civil War began in earnest, taken the overland route to the Territory of Nevada&#x2014;or Washoe, as westerners called it, after a local Indian tribe.</p><p>Now he fell in love with the first and only metropolis of the Far West. &#x201c;After the sage-brush and alkali deserts of Washoe,&#x201d; he later wrote, &#x201c;San Francisco was Paradise to me.&#x201d; Its grandeur and festivity exhilarated him, and he gorged himself with abandon. He drank champagne in the dining room of the Lick House, a palatial haunt of high society modeled on the banquet hall at Versailles. He toured the pleasure gardens on the outskirts of town. He met a pretty girl named Jeannie, who snubbed him when he said hello and said hello when he snubbed her. He rode to the beach and listened to the roaring surf and put his toes in the Pacific. On the far side of the continent, he felt the country&#x2019;s vastness.</p><p>He hadn&#x2019;t planned to stay long, but a nonstop itinerary of eating, drinking, sailing, and socializing kept him too busy to bear the thought of leaving. In mid-May, he wrote his mother and sister to say he would remain for another ten days, two weeks at the most. By early June, another letter announced he was still in San Francisco, had switched lodgings to a fancier hotel, and showed no signs of slowing his demonic pace. &#x201c;I am going to the Dickens mighty fast,&#x201d; he wrote, a taunt aimed squarely at his devoutly Calvinist mother. The city offered many after-dark amusements&#x2014;high-toned saloons and divey dance halls, gambling dens and girlie shows&#x2014;and Twain rarely returned home before midnight. He was never at a loss for companionship: he reckoned he knew at least a thousand of the city&#x2019;s 115,000 residents, mostly friends from Nevada. The city&#x2019;s main thoroughfare, Montgomery Street, where crowds and carriages swarmed under gleaming Italianate facades, reminded him of his hometown. &#x201c;[W]hen I go down Montgomery street, shaking hands with Tom, Dick &amp; Harry,&#x201d; he wrote his family, &#x201c;it is just like being in Main street in Hannibal &amp; meeting the old familiar faces.&#x201d;</p><p>Spring turned to summer, and still Twain hadn&#x2019;t left. Dreading the inevitable, he clung on as long as he could. &#x201c;It seems like going back to prison to go back to the snows &amp; the deserts of Washoe,&#x201d; he complained. In July, he finally said farewell. He had been away from Nevada for two months. Even after he had settled back into the sagebrush on the dry side of the Sierras, the city lingered in his mind. Over the course of the next year he would find many reasons to return: first to visit, then to live. He would chronicle its quirks, and hurt the feelings of not a few of its citizens. In exchange, San Francisco would mold him to literary maturity. It would inspire his evolution from a provincial scribbler into a great American writer, from Hannibal&#x2019;s Samuel Clemens into America&#x2019;s Mark Twain.</p><p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�</p><p>ON FEBRUARY 3, 1863, Three months before the carrot-haired rambler roared into California, the residents of Virginia City, Nevada, awoke to find an unfamiliar name in their newspaper. That day&#x2019;s <i>Territorial Enterprise</i> ran a letter from Carson City, the nearby capital, about a lavish party hosted by the former governor of California. The reporter arrived in the company of a bumptious, ill-bred friend&#x2014;&#x201c;the Unreliable&#x201d;&#x2014;and proceeded to drain the punch bowl and sing and dance drunkenly until two in the morning. Several famous citizens made cartoonish cameos. Affixed to the bottom of this waggish sketch of Washoe society was a new name: &#x201c;Mark Twain.&#x201d;</p><p>This debut didn&#x2019;t attract much notice at the time. Clemens had written under a number of pseudonyms; it occurred to no one that his latest, Mark Twain, would someday be the most famous alias in America. The writing was clever, but only faintly colored by the brilliance that would later revolutionize American literature. He was always a late bloomer; his gifts took time to develop, and to be understood. He entered the world on November 30, 1835, a pale and premature child. &#x201c;When I first saw him I could see no promise in him,&#x201d; his mother said.</p><p>The origins of his pen name remain a mystery. In one disputed account, Twain claimed to have stolen the pseudonym from a famous steamboat captain named Isaiah Sellers. On the Mississippi, the leadsman would mark the depth on the sounding line and call it out to the pilot; &#x201c;mark twain&#x201d; meant &#x201c;two fathoms,&#x201d; a phrase that could signal safety or danger depending on the ship&#x2019;s location.

When music becomes integrated into personal memories, an invitation to remember is provided through both purposeful listening activities and incidental engagement with music in the everyday. The result is a metaphorical canon of music that accompanies life experiences.<br> The Lifetime Soundtrack investigates musically motivated autobiographical memories as they relate to the lifetime soundtrack in order to provide further understanding of their occurrence, nuance, emotionality, and function for individuals. Drawing on in-depth discussions with younger and older adults, each chapter reflects on a common theme or aspect of musically motivated memory. People, places, and eras feature frequently, with memories of childhood, family, past romantic relationships, and the major and minor events occurring within them acting as prime sites for memory and music interaction. The book also considers the ways in which musically memory may manifest differently for trained musicians, for whom music represents both leisure and work. Forging a broad foundation in an overlooked area, this study brings together sociological views on the personal use of music and existing ideas on the workings of human memory. At the same time, it aims to fortify the concept of the Lifetime Soundtrack as a sociological concept with broad application in future research. In so doing, the book highlights the significance of music-enhanced reflection as a tool for the composition of meaning within everyday life.</p><p>Dr. Lauren Istvandity is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Queensland Conservatorium Research Centre, Griffith University.

For generations of migrant workers, from Okies fleeing the Dust Bowl of the 1930s to Mexican laborers today, Imperial County has held the promise of paradise-and the reality of hell. It is a land beautiful and harsh, enticing and deadly, rich in history and heartbreak. Across the border, the desert is the same but there are different secrets. In <i>Imperial</i>, award-winning writer William T. Vollmann takes us deep into the heart of this haunted region, and by extension into the dark soul of American imperialism.<br><br> Known for his penetrating meditations on poverty and violence, Vollmann has spent ten years doggedly investigating every facet of this bi-national locus, raiding archives, exploring polluted rivers, guarded factories, and Chinese tunnels, talking with everyone from farmers to border patrolmen in his search for the fading American dream and its Mexican equivalent. The result is a majestic book that addresses current debates on immigration, agribusiness, and corporate exploitation, issues that will define America's identity in the twenty-first century.</p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, August 2009:</b> How do you describe a 1,300-page book in 150 words?

Through a combination of research, memory, and exaggeration, Ward voices ideas concerning the relationship between history and the present, art and life, parents and children, husbands and wives. Set in many parts of the West, Angle of Repose is a story of discovery--personal, historical, and geographical--that endures as Wallace Stegner's masterwork: an illumination of yesterday's reality that speaks to today's.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angle of Repose is a long, intricate, deeply rewarding novel," wrote William Abrahams in the Atlantic Monthly. "[It] is neither the predictable historical-regional Western epic, nor the equally predictable four-decker family saga, the Forsytes in California, so to speak. . . . For all [its] breadth and sweep, Angle of Repose achieves an effect of intimacy, hence of immediacy, and, though much of the material is 'historical,' an effect of discovery also, of experience newly minted rather than a pageantlike re-creation. . . . Wallace Stegner has written a superb novel, with an amplitude of scale and richness of detail altogether uncommon in contemporary fiction."<br>"Angle of Repose is a novel about Time, as much as anything--about people who live through time, who believe in both a past and a future. . . . It reveals how even the most rebellious crusades of our time follow paths that our great-grandfathers' feet beat dusty."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Wallace Stegner<b>Wallace Stegner</b> was born in 1909 in Lake Mills, Iowa. The son of Scandinavian immigrants, he traveled with his parents and brother all over the West-to North Dakota, Washington, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Wyoming-before settling in Salt Lake City in 1921. Many of the landscapes he encountered in his peripatetic youth figure largely in his work, as do characters based on his stern father and athletic, outgoing brother. Stegner received most of his education in Utah, graduating from the University in 1930. He furthered his education at the University of Iowa, where he received a master's and a doctoral degree. He married Mary Stuart Page in 1934, and for the next decade the couple followed Wallace's teaching career-to the University of Wisconsin, Harvard, and eventually to Stanford University, where he founded the creative writing program, and where he was to remain until his retirement in 1971. A number of his creative writing students have become some of today's most well respected writers, including Wendell Berry, Thomas McGuane, Raymond Carver, Edward Abbey, Robert Stone, and Larry McMurty.<br><br>Throughout his career and after, Stegner's literary output was tremendous. His first novel, Remembering Laughter, was published in 1937. By the time of his death in 1993 he had published some two dozen works of fiction, history, biography, and essays. Among his many literary prizes are the Pulitzer Prize for <b>Angle of Repose</b> (1971) and the National Book Award for <b>The Spectator Bird </b>(1976). His collection of essays, <b>Where the Bluebird Sings to the Lemonade Springs</b> (1992), was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle award.<p><br>Although his fiction deals with many universal themes, Stegner is primarily recognized as a writer of the American West. Much of his literature deals with debunking myths of the West as a romantic country of heroes on horseback, and his passion for the terrain and its inhabitants have earned him the title 'The Dean of Western Letters'. He was one of the few true Men of Letters in this generation. An historian, essayist, short story writer and novelist, as well as a leading environmental writer. Although always connected in people's minds with the West, he had a long association with New England. Many short stories and one of his most successful novels, Crossing to Safety, are set in Vermont, where he had a summer home for many years. Another novel, <b>The Spectator Bird</b>, takes place in Denmark.</p><p><br>An early environmentalist, he actively championed the region's preservation and was instrumental-with his now-famous 'Wilderness Letter'-in the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act. Honest and straightforward, educated yet unpretentious, cantankerous yet compassionate, <b>Wallace Stegner</b> was an enormous presence in the American literary landscape, a man who wrote and lived with ferocity, energy, and integrity.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Jackson J.

It has been more than thirty years since Martin Luther King Jr. shouted those words to a crowd gathered in Washington, D.C. His speech, "I Have a Dream," is now familiar, even famous. But has his dream been realized? In <em>Free at Last?</em> Carl Ellis offers an in-depth assessment of the state of African-American freedom and dignity within American culture today. Updating and expanding his examination (previously published as <em>Beyond Liberation</em>) for a new generation of readers, Ellis stresses how important it is for African-Americans to know who they are and where they have been. So he begins by tracing the growth of Black consciousness from the days of slavery to the present, noting especially the contributions of King and Malcolm X. He also pays particular attention to traces of a "theological soul dynamic," an authentic manifestation of Christianity in Black culture, which runs through American history. It is this dynamic faith, says Ellis, that promises true freedom--the realization of King's dream--for African-Americans today.</p><p>In an updated version of Beyond Liberation, Ellis traces the maturing of the Black consciousness from slavery days to the present. Noted especially are the contributions of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.Carl F. Ellis (M.A., Westminster Theological Seminary) is president of Project Joseph, a ministry dedicated to equipping the church for today&#39;s challenges.</p><h2>Baseball in the Garden of Eden: Baseball in the Garden of Eden</h2><p>Think you know how the game of baseball began? Think again. <br><br>Forget Abner Doubleday and Cooperstown. Forget Alexander Joy Cartwright and the New York Knickerbockers. Instead, meet Daniel Lucius Adams, William Rufus Wheaton, and Louis Fenn Wadsworth, each of whom has a stronger claim to baseball paternity than Doubleday or Cartwright. <br><br>But did baseball even have a father&#x2014;or did it just evolve from other bat-and-ball games? John Thorn, baseball&#x2019;s preeminent historian, examines the creation story of the game and finds it all to be a gigantic lie, not only the Doubleday legend, so long recognized with a wink and a nudge. From its earliest days baseball was a vehicle for gambling (much like cricket, a far more popular game in early America), a proxy form of class warfare, infused with racism as was the larger society, invigorated if ultimately corrupted by gamblers, hustlers, and shady entrepreneurs. Thorn traces the rise of the New York version of the game over other variations popular in Massachusetts and Philadelphia. He shows how the sport&#x2019;s increasing popularity in the early decades of the nineteenth century mirrored the migration of young men from farms and small towns to cities, especially New York. And he charts the rise of secret professionalism and the origin of the notorious &#x201c;reserve clause,&#x201d; essential innovations for gamblers and capitalists. No matter how much you know about the history of baseball, you will find something new in every chapter. Thorn also introduces us to a host of early baseball stars who helped to drive the tremendous popularity and growth of the game in the post&#x2013;Civil War era: Jim Creighton, perhaps the first true professional player; Candy Cummings, the pitcher who claimed to have invented the curveball; Albert Spalding, the ballplayer who would grow rich from the game and shape its creation myth; Hall of Fame brothers George and Harry Wright; Cap Anson, the first man to record three thousand hits and a virulent racist; and many others. Add bluff, bluster, and bravado, and toss in an illicit romance, an unknown son, a lost ball club, an epidemic scare, and you have a baseball detective story like none ever written. <br><br>Thorn shows how a small religious cult became instrumental in the commission that was established to determine the origins of the game and why the selection of Abner Doubleday as baseball&#x2019;s father was as strangely logical as it was patently absurd. Entertaining from the first page to the last, <i>Baseball in the Garden of Eden </i>is a tale of good and evil, and the snake proves the most interesting character. It is full of heroes, scoundrels, and dupes; it contains more scandal by far than the 1919 Black Sox World Series fix. More than a history of the game, <i>Baseball in the Garden of Eden </i>tells the story of nineteenth-century America, a land of opportunity and limitation, of glory and greed&#x2014;all present in the wondrous alloy that is our nation and its pastime.</p><p>John Thorn was named the Official Baseball Historian for Major League Baseball by Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig in 2011.&nbsp; Thorn founded and edits <i>Base Ball: A Journal of the Early Game, </i>a semiannual scholarly publication. He was the coauthor of <i>Total Baseball, </i>a well-known baseball book, and many other baseball books, notably <i>The Hidden Game of Baseball. </i>He often appears on ESPN, the History Channel, and the MLB Network. He was the chief consultant and on-screen historian for Ken Burns's series "Baseball." He serves as publishing consultant to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Museum of the City of New York.&#x201c;With elegance, wit and precision, John Thorn traces the lineage of baseball, a melting pot of cultures and diversions that became quintessentially American. <i>Baseball in the Garden of Eden</i> is a must read for anyone who claims to know the game.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Jane Leavy, Author of <i>The Last Boy: Mickey Mantle and The End of America&#x2019;s Childhood </i>and <i>Sandy Koufax: A Lefty&#x2019;s Legacy</i><br><br>&#x201c;Baseball&#x2019;s creation myth&#x2014;Abner Doubleday in a Cooperstown pasture in 1839&#x2014;has the merit of being enchanting but the defect of being false in every particular. Now comes another of John Thorn&#x2019;s many contributions to our understanding of baseball, proof that the game is even older and more interesting than most fans know.&#x201d;<br> <br> &#x2014;George F.

Creamer, Author of <i>Babe: The Legend Comes to Life </i>and <i>Stengel: His Life and Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;No sport clings to its myths like baseball, which means it takes a baseball historian of the first rank like John Thorn to turn those myths upside down and inside out. <i>Baseball in the Garden of Eden </i>offers enlightenment for every fan.

And while she waited, the bacteriologist would roll her wheelchair to the windows and look down upon the world. The world below was the parking lot of the Cancer Research and Treatment Center, the neighbor of the bacteriologist's Communicable Disease Laboratory on the University of New Mexico North Campus. It was a crowded lot, and a competitive one, and somewhere in the second year of watching it, the bacteriologist found herself familiar with its patterns. She knew when the meter maids made their rounds, and how long it usually took the tow truck to arrive, and what sort of violation provoked this ultimate punishment, and which vehicles tended to park illegally. She even knew of a romance which seemed to have flared between the female owner of a Datsun and the male owner of the blue Mercedes convertible that parked in the space reserved for one of the lofty administrators. Somewhere in that same second year she had started bringing her binoculars to the lab. She had finally left them there. They were in her hands now--focused upon a dirty green pickup truck which was nosing its way hesitatingly into a space guarded by a sign that read: </p><p>RESERVED FOR ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR<br>VIOLATORS WILL BE TOWED AT OWNERS<br>EXPENSE</p><p>The bacteriologist had learned long ago that cancer patients tended to be scofflaws. They were dying and they knew it. In the face of that, other considerations became less important. But habits of civilized behavior still generally prevailed. It was rare to see such open defiance as the pickup was now demonstrating. </p><p>The defiant one was male, an Indian. Through the binoculars he didn't look defiant. He looked stolid and sick. He climbed laboriously from the cab. The bacteriologist noticed a suitcase on the passenger's seat and felt a sudden mild thrill of admiration. He was checking himself in, abandoning his truck forever to the mercies of the law. The nose thumbed at fate. But the Indian left the suitcase behind. </p><p>He was a large man, with the heavy torso and slender hips the bacteriologist had learned to identify with Navajos. He wore jeans and--despite the August heat--a denim jacket. He walked slowly toward the patients' entrance--a sick man's walk. </p><p>He'll check himself in, the bacteriologist thought, and then he'll come back and get the suitcase, and move the truck. </p><p>Now there was another vehicle showing equally blatant illegality. It was a Chevrolet, silver-gray and new, which rolled past the green pickup and came to rest in the space reserved for the CRTC director. The driver's door opened and a slender man emerged, dressed in white, a straw hat pushed back on his head. The man stood for a moment, apparently looking at the pickup truck. Then he walked around his car and opened the door on the passenger's side. He leaned in, apparently working on something on the front seat. Finally he lifted out a grocery sack with its top folded down. He placed it on the bed of the pickup, among the boards and boxes against the cab. That done, he looked around him, studying the parking lot, the sidewalks, staring finally directly toward the bacteriologist. He was very blond, she saw. Almost an albino. Within a minute he was back in the gray Chevy, driving slowly away. </p><p>It was almost noon when the bacteriologist determined that the life form that had reproduced itself in her petri dish was not a food-poisoning salmonella but harmless nonpathogenic <i>Escherichia coli.</i> She made the required notes, completed the report, and pushed her chair back to the window. A tow truck had arrived. The bacteriologist focused her binoculars. The driver's helper was completing the attachment of the towing bar to the rear of the green pickup. He waved his left hand and squatted beside the pickup wheel, watching something. The sound of the tow truck winch was lost to distance and insulated glass. But the bacteriologist could see the rear of the pickup begin to rise. </p><p>Abruptly, all vision was lost in a dazzle of light. The sound came a second later--a cannon-shot boom. The glass on the bacteriologist's window was pressed inward to its tolerance and just beyond; it cracked, then flexed violently outward, where its shards joined those of a hundred other windows raining down on the empty sidewalks below.</p><br><p><b>Chapter Two</b> </p><p>The rain converted itself abruptly into a flurry of popcorn snow. It rattled off Jim Chee's uniform hat, bounced down the collar of his uniform jacket, and made him shiver. It was the third day of November by the First National Bank of Grants calendar back on Chee's desk, and the very beginning of the Season When the Thunder Sleeps by the less rigid traditional calendar of the Dinee. By either calendar it was too early for this sort of weather--even at this mile-and-a-half altitude on the slope of Mount Taylor. Howard Morgan had predicted possible snow flurries on his Channel 7 weathercast, but Chee hadn't believed it. He'd left his winter coat back at the police station. </p><p>He glanced at his vehicle--a white Chevrolet with the seal of the Navajo Nation and the legend NAVAJO TRIBAL POLICE blazoned on its door. He could retire to the car and turn on the heater. He could seek shelter at the entryway of the residence of Benjamin J. Vines, and perhaps ring the bell a few more times in the hope of attracting someone. The bell made an odd singing sound which he could hear echoing pleasantly through the heavy door. While it had attracted no response at all, Chee was tempted to ring it again just to hear it. The third alternative was to turn up the collar of his jacket to ward off the sleet and continue satisfying his curiosity about this house.</p></p><h2>The Good Wife: The Shocking Betrayal and Brutal Murder of a Godly Woman in Texas</h2><p><p>Roger and Penny Scaggs seemed a poster couple for family values.

Intrigued by reports of lucrative natural gas leases in her neighbors&#x2019; mailboxes, she strikes a deal with a Texas-based energy company. Soon trucks begin rumbling past her small farm, a fenced-off drill site rises on an adjacent hilltop, and domestic animals and pets start to die. When mysterious sicknesses begin to afflict her children, she appeals to the company for help. Its representatives insist that nothing is wrong.</p><p>Alarmed by her children&#x2019;s illnesses, Haney joins with neighbors and a committed husband-and-wife legal team to investigate what&#x2019;s really in the water and air.

Soon a community that has long been suspicious of outsiders faces wrenching new questions about who is responsible for their fate, and for redressing it: The faceless corporations that are poisoning the land? The environmentalists who fail to see their economic distress? A federal government that is mandated to protect but fails on the job?

Presenting the subject for the first time on a truly global scale, Fern�ndez-Armesto tracks the pathfinders who, over the last five millennia, lay down the routes of contact that have drawn together the farthest reaches of the world. From the maritime expeditions connecting Queen Hatshepsut's Egypt to the exotic land of Punt in the second millennium BCE, through the merchants and missionaries of the ancient Silk Roads and the great Iberian explorers of the fifteenth century, to the nineteenth-century explorations of the polar regions, interior Africa, North America, and the South Pacific, Fern�ndez-Armesto spins a grand narrative full of character and story. Deftly embedding these explorations in the cultures, politics, and technologies of their times, he creates a history with unusual depth and breadth. Here is an intellectual adventure as rewarding as it is thrilling. 16 pages of color; 48 maps; 44 illustrations.</p><p><b>Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto</b>, a world-renowned scholar and author, has taught at Oxford University and the University of London, and is now professor of history at Tufts University. He and his family live in Boston.Readers of history will delight in Fern�ndez-Armesto's latest. The Tufts historian (<i>Millennium</i>) deftly manages the near-impossible task of a comprehensive account of world exploration from the dawn of humankind while maintaining an interesting tone throughout. The evocatively titled chapters ("Reaching," "Stirring," "Springing") follow a well-organized outline, and short sections keep the reader from feeling overwhelmed with information. Beginning with <i>Homo erectus</i>'s migrations from East Africa to the rest of the continent and to Eurasia a million and a half years ago, the book examines how and why cultures spread throughout the world. Each section of the globe is examined, from the Tigris and Euphrates to the Pacific Islands, the Middle East and Africa. Along the way, technological and scientific leaps, such as sails, cartography and the cure for scurvy are explained. Fern�ndez-Armesto also looks at the important role economics and politics have played in world exploration, The author excels when he narrows the focus, such as when he places Columbus into historical context so that the magnitude of his journey and its difficulty are fully felt. This volume truly covers everything the title claims, resulting in a rich history of our world. 16 pages of color illus., 44 b&amp;w illus., 48 maps. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Johnson, The Straw Man, and Other Powers.So enduring is the reputation of Marie Curie that more than 100 years after she won her first Nobel Prize, for physics in 1903 (she won a second, for chemistry, in 1911), Curie (1867&#x2013;1934) is still regarded by most as the pre-eminent woman scientist of the 20th century. Goldsmith's straightforward biography illuminates both the public Curie, a tireless scientist obsessed with work, and the private one, a woman who suffered bouts of severe depression, was distant from her children and scarred deeply by the accidental death of her scientist husband, Pierre, in 1906. Using long-sealed Curie family archives, Goldsmith offers a well-rounded view of her subject that makes good dramatic use of the considerable intrigue that surrounded Curie's scientific accomplishments and her private life. Goldsmith also reminds us, without belaboring the point, that Curie overcame obstacles, including pervasive sexism within the scientific community that almost cost her the Nobel. Goldsmith is also adept at demonstrating that for Curie the nexus of public accomplishments and private happiness was tenuous. Although Curie continued working after Pierre's death, Goldsmith says she never allowed his name to be spoken: "Never again would there be a sign of joy." Goldsmith, biographer of Gloria Vanderbilt and Victoria Woodhull, is weakest at explaining the theoretical basis for Curie's scientific breakthroughs, which set the stage for the exploration of the atom.

Chang's grandmother was a warlord's concubine. Her gently raised mother struggled with hardships in the early days of Mao's revolution and rose, like her husband, to a prominent position in the Communist Party before being denounced during the Cultural Revolution. Chang herself marched, worked, and breathed for Mao until doubt crept in over the excesses of his policies and purges. Born just a few decades apart, their lives overlap with the end of the warlords' regime and overthrow of the Japanese occupation, violent struggles between the Kuomintang and the Communists to carve up China, and, most poignant for the author, the vicious cycle of purges orchestrated by Chairman Mao that discredited and crushed millions of people, including her parents."This is a powerful, moving, at times shocking account of three generations of Chinese women, as compelling as Amy Tan." --Mary Morris.<p> "An evocative, often astonishing view of life in a changing China." -- <i>The New York Times</i></p></p><h2>The Lady and the Mountain Man (The Mountain series)</h2><p>Leah Townsend, a recently orphaned heiress, flees Richmond after discovering her fianc�&#x2019;s plot to kill her after their wedding.

Everybody who is anybody is seen at his glittering parties. Day and night his Long Island mansion buzzes with bright young things drinking, dancing and debating his mysterious character. For Gatsby - young, handsome, fabulously rich - always seems alone in the crowd, watching and waiting, though no one knows what for. Beneath the shimmering surface of his life he is hiding a secret: a silent longing that can never be fulfilled. And soon this destructive obsession will force his world to unravel.</p><p>In 1922, F Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple, intricately patterned". That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned and, above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace be comes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties and waits for her to appear. When s he does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbour Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem. <i>Perry Freeman, Amazon.com</i></p>"One of the greatest works of American literature ... a timeless evocation of the allure, corruption and carelessness of wealth." (The Times)<br><br>"A stunning illumination of the world ... not only a miracle of talent but a triumph of technique." (Aaron Beck, Psychiatrist)</p><h2>For the Love of a Child</h2><p>In the sequel to Not Without My Daughter, Mahmoody describes her cultural readjustment to America, her constant fear of her husband&#39;s revenge, and her frustration with a legal system unable to offer her protection. 40,000 first printing. $40,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Mahmoody's latest is part autobiographical sequel to her bestselling Not Without My Daughter (1987), part collection of stories of other parents who have suffered the international abduction of their children, and part survey of the laws currently affecting these parents and children. Mahmoody illuminates the horror of the crime of international child abduction and the often hopeless complexity and expense of combatting it. After her own harrowing escape with her six-year-old daughter, Mahtob, from her abusive husband in Iran, Mahmoody returned to America, wrote her bestselling book, witnessed its transformation into a hit movie, and became an active lecturer and frequent talk-show guest. But none of these activities distracted her from the main focus of her life--her daughter, for whose presence Mahmoody daily gave thanks and for whose safety she constantly feared, always expecting her ex-husband to show up to take his revenge. The author's celebrity attracted many heartbroken parents to her, men and women who had had their children abducted abroad by foreign-born mates (Muslim cultures are heavily represented among the abductors). From these stories, Mahmoody distills some cautionary advice for anyone contemplating intercultural marriage. As the world grows smaller, marriages between people of vastly different cultures will become more common, she points out, and while this can be a source of great richness, it can also hold unsuspected perils--especially when children arrive and different cultures clash. Mahmoody describes the shocking powerlessness of government to act against the resultant crimes, and describes changes in international law that her and others' efforts have brought about in recent years. A dramatic story of personal courage combined with an eloquent plea for greater protection of the rights of the world's most vulnerable citizens. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Those who empathized with Mahmoody's thrilling account of her harrowing escape from Iran, where her marriage deprived her of the protection of U.S. law ( Not Without My Daughter , LJ 11/1/87), will want to read this sequel. After returning to the United States, Mahmoody found that her experience was far from unique--that a multitude of foreign spouses have spirited away their children and virtually held them prisoner. Her new book is a compilation of such cases. Most are not as lucky as Mahmoody, and she devotes much time informing people about international parental abductions and the lack of laws to cover them. Although some international conventions have been signed, they lack adequate means of enforcement, and the right of children to remain in the place they call home is not always respected. Congress has yet to act at all. An excellent purchase for public libraries.

He is an established authority in this arcane but rapidly expanding field and has a personal archive on treasure ships that is unparalleled in its comprehensiveness. He has been involved in the discovery of a wide variety of ships, ranging from a 12th--century junk in the South China Sea that was found with silver, gold, and porcelain on board, to a World War I merchant ship off southern Ireland with a cargo of gold ingots and tin. At present, Nigel Pickford is researching a number of different projects for Swedish, German, Malaysian, American, and British salvage teams, including a 20th--century cargo of gold lost in the Mediterranean, a fabulous 17th--century Spanish treasure ship lost in international waters, four Dutch and Portuguese wrecks of the early 17th century that sank in the Strait of Malacca, and a West African trader wrecked with its cargo of porcelain in Liverpool Bay, England. In recent years, Nigel Pickford has worked for most of the major names in shipwreck salvage, including Michael Hatcher (famous for retrieving the Nanking cargo from the Geldermalsen) and Sverker Hallstrom, who recovered the Vung Tau cargo.Though the jacket proclaims this as "the first comprehensive guide to ships lost at sea and the treasures they have yielded," Pickford's introduction more modestly and accurately states that, because of the lack of records over the vast ages and areas involved," no book on this subject could pretend to be totally comprehensive." Defining a treasure ship broadly as "any ship used to transport a high-value cargo of precious metals or artifacts that do not lose their value when immersed for long periods in salt water," Pickford, a professional shipwreck researcher, provides illuminating text set in a sea of illustrations. The result is a book that is a fine starting point for shipwreck research as well as a browsable coffee-table book, because of the graphics for which Dorling Kindersley is esteemed.<p>The atlas is divided into two main parts. The first, "Shipwrecks," examines 40 significant shipwrecks in two-page spreads combining text with profuse use of photographs and other illustrations. These shipwrecks are arranged into 14 groupings including "The Vikings," "Chinese Junks," and "Pirates and Privateers"; each has its own lavish introductory two-page spread. The book's second main part, "Gazetteer," has two sections: maps and shipwreck listings. The 20 double-page maps locate by number more than 1,400 shipwrecks, indicating for each relative sea depths in yards and meters, date of sinking, and whether or not some salvage history is known. The shipwreck listings indicates, where known, the ship's name and location on a map in the atlas, date of sinking, nationality, tonnage, location, route, cargo, and salvage record.</p><p>Concluding the book are a glossary and a bibliography of about 100 entries each, as well as an index. That the index refers not at all to the 34 pages of shipwreck listings in part 2 makes it difficult to easily locate specific information, such as the cargo of the <i>Titanic</i> or the captain of the <i>San Juan</i>, in that section. The <i>Lusitania</i>, perhaps failing to meet the author's broad definition of treasure ship, escapes mention anywhere in the book.</p><p>Recommended as a seaworthy addition to public, academic, and elementary and secondary school libraries for both reference and browsing. <i></i></p></p><h2>A Child&#39;s First Book of Poems</h2><p>An illustrated collection of short poems on animals and other subjects by such authors as Aileen Fisher, Eleanor Farjeon, Christina Rossetti, and Robert Louis Stevenson.</p><p></p><h2>The Bible: A Biography (Books That Changed the World)</h2><p>As the work at the heart of Christianity, the Bible is the spiritual guide for one out of every three people in the world. It is also the world&#x2019;s most widely distributed book, translated into over two thousand languages, and the world&#x2019;s best selling book, year after year. But the Bible is a complex work with a complicated and obscure history. Made up of sixty-six books&#x201d; written by various authors and divided into two testaments, its contents have changed over the centuries. The Bible has been transformed by translation and, through interpretation, has developed manifold meanings to various religions, denominations, and sects. In this seminal account, acclaimed historian Karen Armstrong discusses the conception, gestation, and life of history&#x2019;s most powerful book. Armstrong analyzes the social and political situation in which oral history turned into written scripture, how this all-pervasive scripture was collected into one work, and how it became accepted as Christianity&#x2019;s sacred text. She explores how scripture came to be read for information, and how, in the nineteenth century, historical criticism of the Bible caused greater fear than Darwinism. This is a brilliant, captivating book, crucial in an age of declining faith and rising fundamentalism.</p><p>Karen Armstrong is the author of numerous books on religious affairs, including Great Transformation: The Beginning of Our Religious Traditions and The Battle for God: A History of Fundamentalism.This latest installment in the Books That Changed the World series portrays the BIBLE as a living organism, examining its development over the centuries and demonstrating how Christian, Jewish, and secular influences are interwoven into the various versions. While the author's reputation for scholarship is evident, this particular effort does not translate well to audio despite Josephine Bailey's competence. Bailey skillfully keeps the text moving, easily handling historical terms and names, but it still sounds like one is listening to a laundry list of names and dates. Perhaps multiple listens might help--as much of the terminology is most likely unfamiliar to the average listener, who would have a far easier experience taking in the information in print.

Indeed, as Tom Standage reveals in his scintillating new book, social media is anything but a new phenomenon. </p><p>From the papyrus letters that Roman statesmen used to exchange news across the Empire to the advent of hand-printed tracts of the Reformation to the pamphlets that spread propaganda during the American and French revolutions, Standage chronicles the increasingly sophisticated ways people shared information with each other, spontaneously and organically, down the centuries. With the rise of newspapers in the nineteenth century, then radio and television, &#x201c;mass media&#x201d; consolidated control of information in the hands of a few moguls. However, the Internet has brought information sharing full circle, and the spreading of news along social networks has reemerged in powerful new ways.</p><p>A fresh, provocative exploration of social media over two millennia, <i>Writing on the Wall</i> reminds us how modern behavior echoes that of prior centuries-the Catholic Church, for example, faced similar dilemmas in deciding whether or how to respond to Martin Luther's attacks in the early sixteenth century to those that large institutions confront today in responding to public criticism on the Internet. Invoking the likes of Thomas Paine and Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet, Standage explores themes that have long been debated: the tension between freedom of expression and censorship; whether social media trivializes, coarsens or enhances public discourse; and its role in spurring innovation, enabling self-promotion, and fomenting revolution. As engaging as it is visionary, <i>Writing on the Wall</i> draws on history to cast new light on today's social media and encourages debate and discussion about how we'll communicate in the future.</p></p><p><b>Tom Standage</b> is digital editor at the<i> Economist</i>, overseeing the magazine's website, smartphone, tablet, and e-reader editions.

He lives in London with his wife and children. Visit his website at www.tomstandage.com.*Starred Review* Whatever adolescents and technophiles might think, social media is nothing new. Standage (A History of the World in 6 Glasses, 2005) explores the human impulse to socialize and the earlier technologies, from papyrus to printing press, that accommodated that impulse. Messengers and travelers shuttled papyrus rolls throughout the Roman Empire. An early Roman newspaper, founded by Julius Caesar, no less, was posted, and readers were expected to copy it and distribute the news themselves through their social networks. The wax tablet bore strong resemblance to the iPad. Pamphlets and news ballads went viral, spread throughout Europe by travelers, and the Devonshire Manuscript was the Tudor-era Facebook. Standage compares the back-and-forth of ancient graffiti comments to comment threads in blogs and puts Paul&#x2019;s epistles in the context of social media as he and other apostles spread Christianity. Rumors, gossip, love poems, and political and religious unrest were all part of the stew of discussion as technology morphed into mass communication and the Internet age. Standage offers historical perspective on such concerns about evolving social media as faddishness, coarsening of discourse, distraction from serious work, and erosion of social skills. Still, the social media evolution marched on, influencing politics and religion and aiding revolution in Europe and the Americas. A thoroughly fascinating look at the evolution of social media. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>Madeline Pop-up Book</h2><p>Madeline, smallest and naughtiest of the twelve little charges of Miss Clavel, wakes up one night with an attack of appendicitis.

Yet admittedly, it is rather fun to pull a tab and see Madeline pooh-pooh the tiger in the zoo, or Miss Clavel turn on her light, or the doctor carry Madeline in his arm in a blanket safe and warm. Madeline herself would be delighted. All of the favorite scenes are here. The only scenes missing are the beginning illustrations of the 12 little girls in 2 straight lines breaking their bread, brushing their teeth, going to bed, and smiling at the good and frowning at the bad. While pop-up books may not withstand extended circulation, librarians who work with the very young in story hours will find this book a wonderful way to introduce children to Madeline and her world.

Perhaps that's why the former president, Nobel Peace Prize-winner, and bestselling author ranks as one of the planet's most respected voices in the areas of human rights, diplomacy, and good government. And when a clearly agitated Carter suggests America is on a slippery slope, globally speaking, as he does throughout <i>Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis</i>, it's wise to pay heed even if the book's overriding Christian perspective may trip cautionary bells in secular readers. <p> More a set of loosely connected essays than a single, precise argument, <i>Our Endangered Values</i> outlines Carter's worldview while pondering what he posits are key problems looming in the 21st century. Thematic touchstones such as the war, environmental negligence, civil liberties, the rich-poor divide, and the separation of church and state form the book's backbone, with Carter filtering each through the prism of his own vast experience. He doesn't much like what he sees. Though much of the data Carter presents to support his arguments is familiar, it's worth repeating that "the rate of firearm homicides in the United States is nineteen times higher than that of 35 other high-income countries combined." That "In addition to imprisonment, the United States of America stands almost alone in the world in our fascination with the death penalty, and our few remaining companions are regimes with a lack of respect for basic human rights." That when it comes to sharing the wealth with poor nations "Americans are the stingiest of all industrialized nations. We allow about one-thirtieth as much as is commonly believed [or] sixteen cents out of each $100 of the gross national income." America: land of the free, home of the brave? Try global bully with a bad attitude and reckless sense of entitlement. </p><p> Carter spends significant time contextualizing his own spirituality, as if to underscore the urgency of his message that fundamentalism in any form is bad, especially when it encroaches on government. Indeed, Carter persuasively links fundamentalism to harmful policy, the subjugation of women, general xenophobia, and a host of other ills occurring all around him. And while George W. Bush in particular and the current administration in general take fewer clips on the chin than might be expected, Carter's arguments for common-sense change are deeply resonant nonetheless. <i>--Kim Hughes</i></p><b>Jimmy Carter</b> was born in Plains, Georgia, and served as thirty-ninth President of the United States.

It is clear from the one hundred superb photographs contained in this volume that beauty resides amid ruins just as it does at restoration sites. The imaginative scope of the photographs and the often poetic nature of the accompanying text leave an indelible impression of the grandeur and graciousness that were embodied in these beautiful southern homes. Clarence John Laughlin does not assert that these plantation structures were inherently original in design. Rather, he acknowledges certain derivations of style from French and classical forms. Tracing the modification, adaptation, and refinement of these forms, he chronicles the development of an architecture peculiar to Louisiana. Through word and picture, Mr. Laughlin demonstrates how climate and indigenous building materials played such an important role in this evolution; for the first time in nineteenth-century America, certain houses appeared in the lower Mississippi valley whose design actually grew out of the nature of the materials used - plastered brick and cypress wood. Since one of the fundamental concerns of the modern architect is to respect the innate character of materials, certain Louisiana plantation houses may be considered important native roots of modern architecture. In this sense, these houses possess a significance that extends beyond aesthetic appeal, romantic legend, or historical fact. Combining a deep feeling for his native Louisiana with his imaginative and masterful photography, Mr. Laughlin has produced a magnificent volume that belongs in the collection of photography buffs and admirers of fine architecture everywhere....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race (Critical America, 21)</h2><p><p>Lily white. White knights. The white dove of peace. White lie, white list, white magic. Our language and our culture are suffused, often subconsciously, with positive images of whiteness. Whiteness is so inextricably linked with the status quo that few whites, when asked, even identify themselves as such. And yet when asked what they would have to be paid to live as a black person, whites give figures running into the millions of dollars per year, suggesting just how valuable whiteness is in American society.</p><p>Exploring the social, and specifically legal origins, of white racial identity, Ian F. Haney Lopez here examines cases in America's past that have been instrumental in forming contemporary conceptions of race, law, and whiteness. In 1790, Congress limited naturalization to white persons. This racial prerequisite for citizenship remained in force for over a century and a half, enduring until 1952. In a series of important cases, including two heard by the United States Supreme Court, judges around the country decided and defined who was white enough to become American.</p><p><b>White by Law</b> traces the reasoning employed by the courts in their efforts to justify the whiteness of some and the non- whiteness of others. Did light skin make a Japanese person white? Were Syrians white because they hailed geographically from the birthplace of Christ? Haney Lopez reveals the criteria that were used, often arbitrarily, to determine whiteness, and thus citizenship: skin color, facial features, national origin, language, culture, ancestry, scientific opinion, and, most importantly, popular opinion. </p><p>Having defined the social and legal origins of whiteness, <b>White by Law </b>turns its attention to white identity today and concludes by calling upon whites to acknowledge and renounce their privileged racial identity.</p><p></p></p><p><p>An Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin, <b>Ian F.

Philip F. Gura masterfully traces their intellectual genealogy to transatlantic religious and philosophical ideas, illustrating how these informed the fierce local theological debates that, so often first in Massachusetts and eventually throughout America, gave rise to practical, personal, and quixotic attempts to improve, even perfect the world. The transcendentalists would painfully bifurcate over what could be attained and how, one half epitomized by Ralph Waldo Emerson and stressing self-reliant individualism, the other by Orestes Brownson, George Ripley, and Theodore Parker, emphasizing commitment to the larger social good.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the 1850s, the uniquely American problem of slavery dissolved differences as transcendentalists turned ever more exclusively to abolition. Along with their early inheritance from European Romanticism, America's transcendentalists abandoned their interest in general humanitarian reform.

Gura is William S. Newman Distinguished Professor of American Literature and Culture at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he holds appointments in English, American studies, and religious studies.&nbsp; American Transcendentalism<br><i>1</i>SEARCHING THE SCRIPTURESIn the late summer of 1812, Harvard students and professors, local clergy, scholars, bibliophiles, and curious onlookers gathered in Boston &#x201c;at the Mansion-House of the late Rev. Mr. Buckminster&#x201d; for the sale of the minister&#x2019;s library, one of the largest in New England. Although he was only thirty-eight when he died, for the previous eighteen years Joseph Stevens Buckminster had presided over Boston&#x2019;s prestigious Brattle Street Church. A civic, intellectual, and religious leader, he was widely regarded as one of New England&#x2019;s most influential ministers, a bold and moving pulpit orator as well as a scholar of the first rank; his premature death was much lamented.1 Over two days the auctioneers Whitwell &amp; Bond sold more than eleven hundred volumes from his collection, some titles individually, others in lots grouped by topic, many published in London or on the Continent. Given the recent embargo of European goods attendant on the War of 1812, these volumes were particularly enticing. The auctioneers requested payment in &#x201c;Cash, Boston-money,&#x201d; and the quality of the library guaranteed good prices: during the two days the sale brought close to six thousand dollars.2The bidding was spirited, at no point more so than when the Reverend Moses Stuart, professor of sacred literature at the recently founded Andover Theological Seminary north of Boston, went head-to-head over one set of books with eighteen-year-old Edward Everett, a recent Harvard graduate with clerical aspirations who two years later would be installed over Buckminster&#x2019;s Brattle Street Church.3 Making this competition seemingly incongruous were the very different religious affiliations of the two bidders. The thirtytwo-year-old Stuart, a Yale graduate, was charged at Andover with defending the strictest form of Calvinist theology, based in the works of Jonathan Edwards and his followers Samuel Hopkins and Joseph Bellamy. Everett, on the other hand, had been raised among Boston&#x2019;s liberal Christians, in Buckminster&#x2019;s church, where parishioners were suspicious of overtly emotional religion and were tutored in a rational view of the Bible that revealed a unitary rather than triune God. What in Buckminster&#x2019;s library could have attracted the interest of two such different men?It was a four-volume work in German, J. G. Eichhorn&#x2019;s <i>Introduction to the Old Testament</i>, published between 1780 and 1783, the first comprehensive modern treatment of the Old Testament&#x2019;s books. Years later Stuart still remembered, &#x201c;with lively and pleasant emotion,&#x201d; how Everett and he had jousted for it. Stuart had gone to the auction thinking Eichhorn&#x2019;s work &#x201c;unknown to our literary community.&#x201d; Moreover, the set was not even beautifully made or bound&#x2014;&#x201c;moderate octavo on coarse hemp paper,&#x201d; he recalled. Thus, he was surprised at Everett&#x2019;s aggressive bidding, up to the extraordinary price of six dollars per volume. But the young man stopped when Stuart subsequently bid a quarter more per book. Stuart had to have it, he explained, and he believed it worth the price. The acquisition of that book, he recalled in 1841, spread its influence over his whole life.4Other attendees were similarly enthralled by the offerings and surprised at the prices fetched, particularly for European theology. The Salem minister William Bentley, for example, was chagrined to be outbid on another of Eichhorn&#x2019;s works, an edition of his multivolume <i>Universal Library of Biblical Literature</i> (1787-1801). Why were the works of this scholar, a faculty member at the universities in Jena and G�ttingen, so prized? Why were so many of the other volumes in the Buckminster sale similarly in German and devoted to scriptural criticism? What was the fascination of such abstruse works, in a language few New Englanders read? And why among bidders at the sale did bitter interdenominational rivalries seem forgotten? As a result of their meeting at the Buckminster auction, for example, Stuart tutored his new friend about other German works and even encouraged Everett to undertake the translation of some. Why was it that during this period, as the Unitarian clergyman Ezra Stiles Gannett recalled, &#x201c;he who could buy nothing else bought a [J. J.] Griesbach,&#x201d; that is, the work of another German biblical scholar?5 The answers lie in the crucible in which New England Transcendentalism was formed, a widely prevalent interest in scriptural language and its meaning.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The intellectual genealogy of Transcendentalism began in early-nineteenth-century New England among clergymen caught up in unresolved theological battles initiated more than half a century earlier, specifically between &#x201c;New Light&#x201d; supporters of the wide-spread religious revivals known as the Great Awakening and their &#x201c;Old Light&#x201d; opponents. The pro-revivalists, epitomized by the great theologian Jonathan Edwards, stressed the necessity of an emotional conversion experience, a change of heart that realigned one&#x2019;s priorities from selfishness to selflessness. The anti-revivalists, led by Boston clergyman Charles Chauncy, argued for the primacy of reason in religion and found the New Lights&#x2019; emphasis on an emotional religious experience&#x2014;a &#x201c;New Birth&#x201d;&#x2014;an insult to human intelligence. To Chauncy and his supporters, religion was a matter of the head and not of the heart.6Over the remainder of the eighteenth century, the Old Lights continued to stress reason in religion, a point of view that eventually led some of them&#x2014;Buckminster, for example&#x2014;to become what first were termed &#x201c;liberal Christians&#x201d; and then, early in the next century, &#x201c;Unitarians.&#x201d; That is, they rejected the notion that the Bible described a Trinitarian deity&#x2014;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit&#x2014;and argued instead for a unitary God. In this reading, Jesus Christ, rather than being a part of the Godhead, was simply the supreme model for humanity, God&#x2019;s gift to show that to which all good Christians should aspire.7Before 1820, those who traveled the full distance to Unitarianism remained few and were vociferously opposed by significant numbers of Trinitarians who controlled the majority of New England&#x2019;s&#x2014;indeed, of America&#x2019;s&#x2014;pulpits. The warring camps jousted with scholarly&#x2014;primarily historical and philological&#x2014;weapons on the fields of scriptural exegesis.8 These clergy fought over language, over what precisely the Bible said with regard to the personality of the deity. They sought to know whether scripture was the direct, unmediated word of God or merely the words of men who interpreted the divine Logos in their own languages and through their own cultural predispositions. To spar in this arena required knowledge of the language and culture of the Bible, information at that time best provided by contemporary German scholars. Thus, Eichhorn, Griesbach, and others had become significant for New England intellectuals.Until the second decade of the nineteenth century, most participants in these battles over scriptural interpretation began from similar premises about the relation of language to meaning, derived from John Locke&#x2019;s famous discussion of the subject in Book III of his <i>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i> (1689). Specifically, they seized upon his declaration of the arbitrariness of language. To Locke, words were merely external stimuli, and the &#x201c;truth&#x201d; of language consisted in its utility. The source of meaning, Locke wrote, was simply &#x201c;rational usage derived from sensory perception.&#x201d; Words were contrivances designed for human convenience. If they came to be used by men as the &#x201c;<i>signs</i> of their <i>ideas</i>,&#x201d; it was not through any &#x201c;natural connection, that there is between particular articulate sounds and certain ideas,&#x201d; but only through &#x201c;a voluntary imposition, whereby such a word is made arbitrarily the mark of an idea.&#x201d; The world&#x2019;s languages thus had no underlying unity, and words in their primary or immediate signification stood only for ideas &#x201c;in the mind of him that uses them.&#x201d; Concomitantly, if men employed terms for which they had not experienced sensory analogues, they did not truly know the meaning of what they said. Words could not be universal symbols, for each man to whom the word-idea was expressed had to learn the truth of the idea empirically. 9Language was thus an artificial construct that rested upon a contract voluntarily entered, or, more precisely, upon a contextual arrangement. As with laws in the political state, neither vocabulary nor syntax had inherent rationale but were created to serve particular needs&#x2014;in this case, human communication. Words were not gifts from God that stood as ciphers to reality, but only noises with no direct correspondence to what they named. Words had &#x201c;meanings&#x201d; that were narrowly cultural, and acts of human communication were only approximations of experience, not magical invocations of it. Language thus had to be interpreted by the intellectual tools that men, as rational creatures, possessed.The stakes in these debates were high when one applied such ideas to the language of the Bible. Was the word of God merely contextual, for example, or did it possess transcendent significance? According to Locke&#x2019;s logic, if the Bible was the word of God, it was in a vocabulary set down <i>by men</i> in a <i>particular</i> place and at a <i>particular</i> time, and so had been affected by the vagaries of human circumstance. In this light, scripture did not consist of divinely inspired words but rather of a vocabulary that was the result of the time and chance above which no human being, Trinitarian or Unitarian, could rise.Settling the matter of what precisely the Bible said&#x2014;and what it meant for subsequent generations of Christians&#x2014;became the work of scriptural exegetes like Eichhorn, Griesbach, and a host of other European and American scholars who pioneered the &#x201c;Higher Criticism&#x201d; of the Bible, a term that Eichhorn coined.10 Higher Critics enlisted the rational, critical tools of modern inquiry to discover the deeper truths of Christianity. In general terms, they focused on historical documents and tried to establish their authorship, date, and place of composition, as opposed to the Lower Critics, who worked primarily on the language and grammar of biblical texts. In particular, Higher Critics challenged the idea that Moses was the author of the first five books of the Old Testament, positing several different sources for the book of Genesis alone, and they urged the study of the Bible as a literary artifact rather than as divinely inspired text. To them, it was a book like any other, to be interpreted through immersion in the cultures and languages of its various authors. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, advanced scholars in this discipline transformed the debates about biblical and, by implication, figurative language.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;American scholars&#x2019; interest in the Higher Criticism also coincided with their discovery of Germany&#x2019;s rich religious and artistic culture. At first they got their information secondhand, particularly from the widely circulated <i>Germany</i> (1810), by Anne-Louise-Germaine Necker, the baroness of Sta�l-Holstein (better known as Madame de Sta�l), which was available in French and, after 1813, in English translation. In addition to providing a road map to the &#x201c;manners,&#x201d; literature, and arts of the nation, de Sta�l devoted many pages to a discussion of the country&#x2019;s philosophical and religious thinkers, particularly Kant, and demonstrated the richly symbiotic relationship between their thought and national culture. Here American readers encountered for the first time a lengthy discussion of philosophical Idealism. For those who chafed under the rationalism and materialism to which Locke&#x2019;s empiricism led, an introduction to German Idealism and its ethical implications was both liberating and exhilarating.De Sta�l also touted the superiority of the German educational system; and with the conclusion of the War of 1812 and the reopening of safe travel to Europe, Americans began to visit the Continent and to study at German universities. Among the most prominent of these pioneers were George Ticknor, Edward Everett, George Bancroft, and Frederic Henry Hedge, all of whom eventually carved out positions of intellectual leadership in New England and led efforts to disseminate German language and thought.By the time Ticknor was nineteen, and a Dartmouth graduate, for example, he had read in de Sta�l of the great university at G�ttingen and was determined to sample its educational resources. He knew little German, however, and turned to his friend Edward Everett for guidance. Everett provided him with a German-French dictionary, with which he began his tutorial. Eventually, in 1815 he, Everett, and two others sailed for Europe and made their way to Germany&#x2019;s cultural centers. At G�ttingen, Ticknor took classes with, among others, Eichhorn himself, whom he found &#x201c;lively, gay, full of vigour, though not young, and interested in everything.&#x201d; The young Bostonian luxuriated in this intellectual hothouse.During his European sojourn Ticknor met other prominent intellectuals, including at Weimar the writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and in Paris the philosophers A. W. von Schlegel and Alexander von Humboldt. He continued his introductions in London, where he greeted the American author Washington Irving and the English writers William Hazlitt, William Godwin, and Charles Lamb, among others. Upon his return to the United States in 1819 Ticknor assumed the position of Smith Professor of French and Spanish Languages and Literature at Harvard, which had been held for him while he studied abroad. Although he was not responsible for teaching the German language per se, his experience abroad made him attentive to students&#x2019; needs, and in 1825 he convinced Harvard to hire Karl Follen (1796&#x2013;1840), a German expatriate whom he had met in Switzerland, to teach the language.Upon his arrival at G�ttingen, Ticknor&#x2019;s traveling companion Everett, similarly promised a chair (in Greek) at Harvard upon his return, took private classes with Eichhorn in Hebrew and Arabic and engaged him as well for a tutorial in German literature. In addition, Everett pursued advanced studies in Greek to fulfill his obligation to Harvard, and in 1817 he received a doctorate in philosophy, the first such awarded an American from a German university. After his and Ticknor&#x2019;s audience with Goethe in 1816, Everett prepared an essay on him, published in 1817 in the <i>North American Review</i>, the first important notice of this writer to appear in the United States.11 The following winter Everett continued his travels. In Paris he met the German naturalist and explorer Wilhelm von Humboldt, the philosopher Benjamin Constant, and de Sta�l herself. He returned to the United States the same year as Ticknor to assume his duties at Harvard. From that position he influenced countless students, many of whom sought him out to learn more of German language and thought. Years later Emerson testified to this professor&#x2019;s large influence, observing that &#x201c;the genius of Everett&#x201d; was &#x201c;almost comparable to that of Pericles in Athens,&#x201d; as even &#x201c;the rudest undergraduate found a new morning open to him&#x201d; in Everett&#x2019;s lecture hall.12In the summer of 1818 eighteen-year-old George Bancroft, later a prominent Democratic politician and one of the country&#x2019;s most distinguished historians, followed in Ticknor&#x2019;s and Everett&#x2019;s footsteps for study at G�ttingen, with Frederic Henry Hedge, the twelve-year-old son of Harvard professor of logic Levi Hedge (with whom Bancroft had boarded), in tow.

With Wilson&#x2019;s leadership, the governments at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 founded the League of Nations, a federation of the world&#x2019;s democracies.

Based on Dostoyevsky&#39;s own experience of financial desperation and the compulsive desire to win money, it focuses on the characters that take their places at the gaming tables of &#39;Roulettenburg&#39;: the outspoken, aristocratic &#39;Grandmamma&#39;, the mercenary Mademoiselle Blanche, the cool, mysterious Polina and Alex, the author&#39;s self-portrait; a man gripped by exhilaration and hopelessness. &#34;Bobok&#34; is a blackly comic satire in which a desolate writer becomes drawn into the conversations of the dead, and &#34;A Nasty Story&#34; is a humorous look at the disparity between a man&#39;s exaggerated ideal of himself and the sad reality.</p><p><p> <strong>FyodorDostoyevsky </strong>(18211881), one of nineteenth-century Russias greatest novelists, spent four years in a convict prison in Siberia, after which he was obliged to enlist in the army. In later years his penchant for gambling sent him deeply into debt. Most of his important works were written after 1864, including <strong>Notes from Underground</strong>, <strong>Crime and Punishment</strong>, <strong>The Idiot</strong>, and <strong>The Brothers Karamazov,</strong> all available from Penguin Classics.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Discipline and Punish : The Birth of the Prison</h2><p>In the Middle Ages there were gaols and dungeons, but punishment was for the most part a spectacle. The economic changes and growing popular dissent of the 18th century made necessary a more systematic control over the individual members of society, and this in effect meant a change from punishment, which chastised the body, to reform, which touched the soul. Foucault shows the development of the Western system of prisons, police organizations, administrative and legal hierarchies for social control - and the growth of disciplinary society as a whole. He also reveals that between school, factories, barracks and hospitals all share a common organization, in which it is possible to control the use of an individual&#39;s time and space hour by hour.</p><p>One of the leading intellectuals of the twentieth century and the most prominent thinker in post-war France, Foucault&#39;s work influenced disciplines as diverse as history, sociology, philosophy, sociology and literary criticism.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Noah&#39;s Ark</h2><p>The author and illustrator gives his special imaginative touch to the most famous animal story through more than two hundred full-color paintings and a lively text</p><p>Rien Poortvliet was one of Holland's most popular artists and the author of Abrams' <i>Gnomes</i> and <i>Secrets of the Gnomes</i>, among others. After a successful career in advertising, Poortvliet dedicated himself to book illustration. Although he passed away in 1995, his books remain classics, continuing to enchant both new readers and longtime enthusiasts.Creator of Gnomes, Dogs and Dutch Treat, Dutch artist Poortvliet tackles the Biblical story of Noah and the flood in this oversize, lavishly produced album. We watch as Noah and his family build the ark with a big wooden crane, then see how the animals adjust to cramped conditions on the boat, until they finally go forth onto dry land. While this imaginative, pictorial retelling shows empathy for the animal kingdom and gently preaches reverence for life, the pictures (223 pages in color) are sentimental to the point of anthropomorphizing the animals, and the handwritten commentaries are frequently coy or trite. Besides continually proclaiming his awe at the infinite variety of creation, Poortvliet devotes pages to comparative studies of beaks, eyes, ears, snouts. He annoyingly mixes in boyhood reminiscences and musings on being an artist. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>xxxHOLiC, Vol. 11</h2><p>Kimihiro Watanuki has been saved from death by the sacrifices of his friends, but his recovery time is cut short.

Writing with freelancer Paisner, Quinn recalls his self-doubts concerning marriage to Cecil B.

With verve and wit he relates how he prepared his most famous roles: Gauguin in Lust for Life, Zampano in La Strada, Zorba in Zorba the Greek and others, and how he managed to put his own personal stamp on the role of Stanley Kowalski in the road company of A Streetcar Named Desire despite Brando's indelible characterization.

It&#39;s always good to have a grasp of the distinctive work that God has done in our fellowship. If Calvary Chapel is exactly like the church across the street it would be better to simply merge the two. But, if there are qualities that make us different, then we have a unique and special place in the plan of God. Certainly there are churches that share many of our beliefs and practices. But God has done a wonderful work of balance in the Calvary Chapel movement that does make us different. Some churches believe in the gifts and ministry of the Holy Spirit, but don&#39;t have a strong emphasis on Biblical teaching. Others place strong emphasis on teaching the Word of God, but don&#39;t believe the gifts of the Spirit are available and valid today. In Calvary Chapel we value the teaching of the Word, and possess an open heart to the work of the Holy Spirit. This balance makes Calvary Chapel a distinct and uniquely blessed movement of God. And so, it&#39;s important to understand the Biblical principles that explain why God has allowed us to exist and grow.</p><p>Chuck Smith was the founder of the Calvary Chapel Movement, and taught the Bible for more than sixty years.

His music, at once a source of transcendent beauty and coruscating noise, violated all definitions of genre while speaking to millions of fans and inspiring generations of musicians.<br><br>But while his iconic status may be fixed, the man himself was anything but. Lou Reed's life was a transformer's odyssey. Eternally restless and endlessly hungry for new experiences, Reed reinvented his persona, his sound, even his sexuality time and again. A man of contradictions and extremes, he was fiercely independent yet afraid of being alone, artistically fearless yet deeply paranoid, eager for commercial success yet disdainful of his own triumphs. Channeling his jagged energy and literary sensibility into classic songs - like "Walk on the Wild Side" and "Sweet Jane" - and radically experimental albums alike, Reed remained desperately true to his artistic vision, wherever it led him. <br><br>Now, just a few years after Reed's death, <i>Rolling Stone</i> writer Anthony DeCurtis, who knew Reed and interviewed him extensively, tells the provocative story of his complex and chameleonic life. With unparalleled access to dozens of Reed's friends, family, and collaborators, DeCurtis tracks Reed's five-decade career through the accounts of those who knew him and through Reed's most revealing testimony, his music. We travel deep into his defiantly subterranean world, enter the studio as the Velvet Underground record their groundbreaking work, and revel in Reed's relationships with such legendary figures as Andy Warhol, David Bowie, and Laurie Anderson.

He advises the novice what type of material is best to work with, and in a step-by-step process shows how to begin with elementary forms and proceed to the more complex, used for creating human figures, portrait heads, bas reliefs, and other forms of sculpture. Helpful instruction and diagrams of the proper procedure for constructing armatures and the proper methods for the use of tools are passed on to the reader along the way.<br>When the use of clay and plasteline are well in hand, Mr. Slobodkin moves to the handling of more difficult materials. Plaster casting, wood carving, stone carving, terra cotta, metal sculpture, and architectural sculpture are all covered with hundreds of drawings and progressive photographs to add clarity. A most welcome aspect of this book is the author's witty and readable style. Technical passages never become oppressive, and words of encouragement and inspiration are offered frequently. One is well aware that the author was once a novice and facing the same difficulties himself. For the beginner this book is invaluable, but even those who have been sculpting for years will find the latter chapters full of helpful hints and useful information.</p></p><p></p><h2>Making Jigs and Fixtures: Techniques for Better Woodworking (The Workshop Companion)</h2><p>This step-by-step pictorial manual shows how to design and build jigs for every operation in the shop, choose materials for strength and durability, and where to purchase particular hardware.

His&nbsp;cause went down in disastrous defeat and left the&nbsp;South impoverished for generations. If that cause&nbsp;had succeeded, it would have torn the United&nbsp;States in two and preserved the institution of&nbsp;slavery. Many Americans in Davis&#x2019;s own time and in&nbsp;later generations considered him an incompetent&nbsp;leader, if not a traitor. Not so, argues James M.&nbsp;McPherson. In <i>Embattled Rebel</i>, McPherson shows us&nbsp;that Davis might have been on the wrong side of&nbsp;history, but it is too easy to diminish him because of&nbsp;his cause&#x2019;s failure. In order to understand the Civil&nbsp;War and its outcome, it is essential to give Davis his&nbsp;due as a military leader and as the president of an&nbsp;aspiring Confederate nation.<br><br>Davis did not make it easy on himself. His&nbsp;subordinates and enemies alike considered him&nbsp;difficult, egotistical, and cold. He was gravely ill&nbsp;throughout much of the war, often working from&nbsp;home and even from his sickbed.

As president of the Confederate States of America, he led a cause that went down to a disastrous defeat and left the South in poverty for generations. If that cause had succeeded, it would have broken the United States in two and preserved slavery in the South for untold years. Many Americans of his own time and in later generations considered him a traitor. Some of his Confederate compatriots turned against Davis and blamed him for sins of ineptitude that lost the war. Several of Davis&#x2019;s adversaries on the Union side agreed with this assessment. Writing twenty years after the Civil War, General Ulysses S. Grant claimed that &#x201c;Davis had an exalted opinion of his own military genius.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On several occasions during the war he came to the relief of the Union army by means of his <i>superior military genius.</i>&#x201d; A number of historians have concurred with this harsh judgment. On the centennial anniversary of the Civil War, David M. Potter famously declared that as commander in chief, Davis compiled &#x201c;a record of personal failure significant enough to have had a bearing on the course of the war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the Union and Confederacy had exchanged presidents with one another, the Confederacy might have won its independence.&#x201d;1</p><p>Comparisons of Abraham Lincoln and Davis as commanders in chief usually favor Lincoln, though rarely to the extent suggested by Potter. The one undeniable truth in such comparisons is that Lincoln&#x2019;s side won the war. But that fact does not necessarily mean that Davis was responsible for losing it. Many factors help explain the ultimate Union victory, including the North&#x2019;s greater population and resources, a stronger economy, a powerful navy, resourceful military leadership, and battlefield victories that blunted Confederate momentum at key points and prolonged the conflict until the weak economic infrastructure that underpinned the Southern war effort collapsed. Lincoln&#x2019;s evolving skills as commander in chief may also help explain Northern victory. I have written about that subject elsewhere.2 But whether Lincoln was superior to Davis in this respect is impossible to say in the categorical manner stated by David Potter. Comparing Lincoln and Davis as commanders in chief is like trying to compare apples and oranges. They confronted different challenges with different resources and personnel. In the chapters that follow I have tried to avoid the temptation to compare the two leaders. I attempt to describe and analyze Davis&#x2019;s conception and execution of his duty as commander in chief on its own terms and merits, without reference to Lincoln.</p><p>Full disclosure is necessary. My sympathies lie with the Union side in the Civil War. The Confederacy fought to break up the United States and to sustain slavery. I consider those goals tragically wrong. Yet I have sought to transcend my convictions and to understand Jefferson Davis as a product of his time and circumstances. After spending many research hours with both Lincoln and Davis, I must also confess that I find Lincoln more congenial, interesting, and admirable. That is another reason to avoid comparisons between the two men in a book about Davis as commander in chief. I wish not to be influenced by personal likes or dislikes. But in fact I found myself becoming less inimical toward Davis than I expected when I began this project. He comes off better than some of his fellow Confederates of large ego and small talents who were among his chief critics. I had perhaps been too much influenced by the negative depictions of Davis&#x2019;s personality that have come down to us from those contemporaries who often had self-serving motives for their hostility.</p><p>Many of those contemporaries were officials in the Confederate government and officers in its army. They echoed a Southern journalist who described Davis as &#x201c;cold, haughty, peevish, narrow-minded, pig-headed, malignant.&#x201d;3 Robert Toombs of Georgia, who never got over the selection of Davis rather than himself as president of the Confederacy, denigrated his rival as a &#x201c;false and hypocritical&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wretch.&#x201d;4 Another influential Georgia politician, Linton Stephens, brother of the Confederate vice president, sneered at Davis as &#x201c;a <i>little, conceited, hypocritical, snivelling, canting, malicious, ambitious, dogged knave and fool.</i>&#x201d;5 General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, whom Davis had removed from command of the Army of Tennessee in June 1862, wrote, &#x201c;I thank my creator that I am not the essence of egotism, vanity, obstinacy, perversity, and vindictiveness&#x201d; that he considered Davis to be.6 In truth, Beauregard was more accurately describing himself. The same might be said of Toombs, Stephens, and others who denounced the Confederate president as hypocritical and malicious. The hostility that developed between Davis and certain generals and political leaders&#x2014;whether the chief fault was theirs or his&#x2014;impaired his ability to function effectively as commander in chief.</p><p>To be sure, there was some substance underlying the stereotypes of Davis&#x2019;s disagreeable personality. He did not suffer fools gladly, and he let them know it. He did not practice the skillful politician&#x2019;s art of telling others what they wanted to hear. He did not flatter their egos, and he sometimes asserted his own. He did not hesitate to criticize others but was often thin-skinned about their criticisms of him. Davis could be austere, humorless, and tediously argumentative. He sometimes misinterpreted disagreement as personal hostility. Stephen R. Mallory, the Confederate secretary of the navy, had a mostly cordial relationship with Davis. But Mallory noted that &#x201c;few men could be more chillingly, freezingly cold.&#x201d; In the president&#x2019;s dealings with congressmen, &#x201c;he rarely satisfied or convinced them simply because in his manner and language there was just an indescribable something which offended their self-esteem and left their judgments room to find fault with him.&#x201d;7</p><p>But a Georgia congressman who had heard and believed all the negative comments about Davis changed his mind after a long conversation with him late in the war. &#x201c;He has been greatly wronged,&#x201d; the congressman wrote to his wife. He &#x201c;is not the stern, puffed up man he is represented to be. He was as polite, attentive, and communicative to me as I could wish. He listened patiently to all I said and when he differed with me he would give his reasons for it. He was very cordial.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And many gentlemen tell me the same thing as to his manner with them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His enemies have done him great injustice.&#x201d;8</p><p>Davis&#x2019;s fragile health may account for these Jekyll and Hyde descriptions of his personality. No chief executive in American history suffered from as many chronic maladies as Jefferson Davis. The malaria that killed his first wife in 1835 struck him as well, and symptoms recurred frequently during the rest of his life. Corneal ulceration of his left eye produced virtual blindness in that eye and may have caused the severe neuralgia that often racked him with excruciating pain, nausea, and headaches. &#x201c;Dyspepsia,&#x201d; a catchall nineteenth-century term for digestive disorders that in Davis&#x2019;s case may have been ulcers or acid reflux, repeatedly laid him low. He had little appetite, skipped meals, and became increasingly gaunt as the war went on. Bronchial problems, insomnia, and boils added to his misery.9</p><p>For days and sometimes weeks at a time he was unable to come to his office, but worked from his home and occasionally from his sickbed. His workaholic habits doubtless exacerbated his illnesses. One of his worst bouts of sickness occurred in April and May 1863 during the Chancellorsville and Vicksburg campaigns. He &#x201c;has not been in his office for more than a month,&#x201d; wrote a War Department clerk in early May, but &#x201c;he still attends to business at his dwelling.&#x201d; He had &#x201c;sent to the War Department fifty-five letters&#x201d; on various subjects that day with instructions on &#x201c;what he wished done in the premises.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think he has been ill every day for years, but this has been his most serious attack.&#x201d;10 His maladies were probably made worse by stress. They may have been partly psychosomatic but were nonetheless severe. Although one cannot point to examples of how his bouts of illness affected any specific decisions or actions as commander in chief, his chronic health problems surely had an impact on his overall performance. And they no doubt helped account for the perceived irritability and peevishness that he occasionally exhibited in personal relationships.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Jefferson Davis</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As a wartime commander in chief, Davis determined, performed, or oversaw five categories of activity: policy, national strategy, military strategy, operations, and tactics. Neither Davis nor anyone else defined these functions in a systematic way during the Civil War. If they had, their definitions might have looked something like these: <i>Policy</i> refers to war aims&#x2014;the political goals of the Confederacy. <i>National strategy</i> refers to the mobilization of the political, economic, diplomatic, and psychological as well as military resources of the nation to achieve those war aims. <i>Military strategy</i> concerns plans for the employment of armed forces to win the war and fulfill the goals of policy. <i>Operations</i> concerns the management and movements of armies in particular campaigns to carry out the purposes of military strategy. <i>Tactics</i> refers to the formations and handling of an army in a specific battle.</p><p>Davis shaped and articulated the principal policy of the Confederacy with clarity and force: the quest for independent nationhood. Although he had not been a fire-eating secessionist, once Davis committed himself to a Confederate nation he never deviated from this goal or compromised its purpose. In a sense, he was the last Confederate left standing in 1865. A vital corollary of this policy was the preservation of slavery as the core institution of the Confederate polity. Davis was a large slaveholder and a consistent defender of the institution of bondage. But even slavery was subordinate to nationhood, and by 1865 Davis was prepared to jettison it if doing so would help achieve Confederate independence.</p><p>Although Davis played an active role in military mobilization, he largely delegated the economic and diplomatic functions of national strategy to the appropriate subordinates. Their record of achievement in these efforts was decidedly mixed, with the failures in economic mobilization and foreign policy a result of factors largely beyond presidential control. Davis made several speaking tours to rally public support for the Confederate cause, and he managed to get most war-related legislation through Congress. Growing political factionalism and the alienation of some groups from the Confederate government marked a partial failure of national strategy. Nevertheless, as Gary Gallagher has shown, the Confederate war effort persisted through great difficulties that would have broken a less determined effort, and for that achievement Davis deserves part of the credit.11</p><p>During his four and one-quarter years as president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis devoted most of his waking hours to military strategy and operations. He was present on several battlefields and even took part in some tactical planning. No other chief executive in American history exercised such hands-on influence in the shaping of military strategy. These activities therefore constitute the principal story line in the pages that follow.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>WE MUST PREPARE FOR A LONG WAR</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On February 10, 1861, Jefferson Davis and his wife, Varina, were taking rose cuttings in their garden at Brierfield, the Davis plantation on the rich bottomland along a looping bend in the Mississippi River. Three weeks earlier, just recovered from an illness that had kept him in bed for several days, Davis had resigned his seat in the United States Senate when he received official word of Mississippi&#x2019;s secession from the Union. He and his family had made their way home slowly, stopping on January 28 at the state capital in Jackson, where Davis learned that he had been named major general of the Army of Mississippi. It was a position congenial to his desires. As a graduate of West Point, an officer in the regular army for seven years, commander of a volunteer regiment in the Mexican-American War, secretary of war in the Franklin Pierce administration, and chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, Davis had vast and varied military experience qualifying him for such a position. He immediately set to work to reorganize and expand the state militia to meet a potential invasion threat from the United States Army.

The classic edition with original art by Hardie Gramatky.</p><p>Hardie Gramatky was born in Dallas, TX, in 1907 but moved to California as a small boy after his father died of tuberculosis. He attended Stanford University (earning the tuition by working as a logger and a bank teller) and Chouinard Art Institute before becoming one of Disney&#x2019;s early animators in 1929. In the 1920s and `30s, he helped start the California Watercolor movement. In 1936, after a 6-year Disney contract expired, he left the company (earning $150 a week, a huge sum in the Depression) to move to New York City with his wife, artist Dorothea Cooke, to become illustrators. It was there, in his studio on Pearl Street, that Gramatky saw a Moran tugboat out his window that obviously didn&#x2019;t want to work and kept making figure 8s on the East River. So in 1939 after painting many watercolors of the busy harbor, Gramatky wondered what would happen if a &#x201c;tug didn&#x2019;t want to tug&#x201d; and wrote the story. The book got immediate attention and has been a favorite picture book ever since, and Gramatky&#x2019;s fine art watercolors and gicl�e prints continue to be prized. He died of cancer of the ileum in Westport, Connecticut, on April 29, 1979.<b>Praise for <i>Little Toot</i> by Hardie Gramatky:</b><br><br>"I am delighted to know that this classic piece of Americana, <i>Little Toot</i>, will be enjoyed by readers of all ages for many years to come."--Eric Carle<br><br>"How delightful to revisit the seaworthy world of brave Little Toot--that little tugboat who proves his courage riding atop Gramatky's superb, water, wild waves.

Drawing upon forty years of archaeological research, Wilkinson takes us inside an exotic tribal society with a pre-monetary economy and decadent, divine kings who ruled with all-too-recognizable human emotions.<br> <br>Here are the years of the Old Kingdom, where Pepi II, made king as an infant, was later undermined by rumors of his affair with an army general, and the Middle Kingdom, a golden age of literature and jewelry in which the benefits of the afterlife became available for all, not just royalty&#x2014;a concept later underlying Christianity. Wilkinson then explores the legendary era of the New Kingdom, a lost world of breathtaking opulence founded by Ahmose, whose parents were siblings, and who married his sister and transformed worship of his family into a national cult. Other leaders include Akhenaten, the &#x201c;heretic king,&#x201d; who with his wife Nefertiti brought about a revolution with a bold new religion; his son Tutankhamun, whose dazzling tomb would remain hidden for three millennia; and eleven pharaohs called Ramesses, the last of whom presided over the militarism, lawlessness, and corruption that caused a crucial political and societal decline.<br> <br>Riveting and revelatory, filled with new information and unique interpretations, <i>The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt </i>will become the standard source about this great civilization, one that lasted&#x2014;so far&#x2014;longer than any other.</p><p><b>Toby Wilkinson</b> graduated with a first class honors degree in Egyptology from Downing College, University of Cambridge, winning the university&#x2019;s Thomas Mulvey prize.

Shaped like a shield, it is carved on both sides in low relief. The scenes, though still crisp, are difficult to make out in the diffuse, hazy light that filters down through the dusty glazed dome in the museum ceiling. Most visitors barely give this strange object a second glance as they head straight for the golden riches of Tutankhamun on the floor above. Yet this modest piece of stone is one of the most important documents to survive from ancient Egypt. Its place of honor at the entrance to the Egyptian Museum, the world's greatest treasure- house of pharaonic culture, underlines its significance. This stone is the object that marks the very beginning of ancient Egyptian history.<br><br>The Narmer Palette, as it is known to Egyptologists, has become an icon of early Egypt, but the circumstances of its discovery are clouded with uncertainty. In the winter of a.d. 1897-1898, the British archaeologists James Quibell and Frederick Green were in the far south of Egypt, excavating at the ancient site of Nekhen (modern Kom el-Ahmar), the "city of the falcon" (classical Hierakonpolis). The nineteenth century was still the era of treasure seeking, and Quibell and Green, though more scientific in their approach than many of their contemporaries, were not immune from the pressure to discover fine objects to satisfy their sponsors back home. So, having chosen to excavate at Nekhen, a site eroded by countless centuries and largely devoid of major standing monuments, they decided to focus their attentions on the ruins of the local temple. Though small and unimpressive by comparison with the great sanctuaries of Thebes, this was no ordinary provincial shrine. Since the dawn of history, it had been dedicated to the celebration of Egyptian kingship. The local falcon god of Nekhen, Horus, was the patron deity of the Egyptian monarchy. Might the temple, therefore, yield a royal treasure?<br><br>The two men worked away, and their initial results were disappointing: stretches of mud brick wall; the remains of a mound, faced in stone; a few worn and broken statues. Nothing spectacular. The next area to be investigated lay in front of the mound, but here the archaeologists encountered only a thick layer of clay that resisted systematic excavation. The city of the falcon seemed determined to keep its secrets. But then, as Quibell and Green struggled their way through the clay layer, they came upon a scatter of discarded ritual objects, a motley collection of sacred paraphernalia that had been gathered up and buried by the temple priests some time in the remote past. There was no gold, but the "Main Deposit"-as the archaeologists optimistically called it-did contain some interesting and unusual finds. Chief among them was a carved slab of stone.<br><br>There was no doubt about what sort of object they had found. A shallow, circular well in the middle of one side showed it to be a palette, a grindstone for mixing pigments. But this was no workaday tool for preparing cosmetics. The elaborate and detailed scenes decorating both sides showed that it had been commissioned for a much loftier purpose, to celebrate the achievements of a glorious king. Beneath the benign gaze of two cow goddesses, a representation of the monarch himself-shown in the age-old pose of an Egyptian ruler, smiting his enemy with a mace-dominated one side of the palette. The archaeologists wondered who he was and when he had reigned. Two hieroglyphs, contained within a small rectangular panel at the very top of the palette, seemed to provide the answer, spelling out the monarch's name: a catfish ("nar" in the Egyptian language) and a chisel ("mer"): Narmer. Here was a king previously unknown to history. Moreover, the style of the carvings on the Narmer Palette pointed to a very early date. Subsequent research showed that Narmer was not just an early king; he was the very first ruler of a united Egypt. He came to the throne around 2950, the first king of the First Dynasty. In the mud of Nekhen, Quibell and Green had stumbled upon ancient Egypt's founding monument.<br><br>While Narmer may be the first historical king, he is not the beginning of Egypt's story. The decoration of his famous palette shows the art of the Egyptian royal court and the iconography of kingship already in their classical forms. However, some of the palette's stranger motifs, such as the intertwined beasts with long serpentine necks and the bull trampling the walls of an enemy fortress, hark back to a remote prehistoric past. On his great commemorative palette, Narmer was explicitly acknowledging that the cornerstones of Egyptian civilization had been laid long before his own time.<br><br>The desert blooms<br><br>As the Narmer Palette demonstrates on a small scale and for an early date, the Egyptians achieved a mastery of stone carving unsurpassed in the ancient, or modern, world. Diverse and abundant raw materials within Egypt's borders combined with great technical accomplishment to give the Egyptians a highly distinctive medium for asserting their cultural identity. Stone also had the advantage of permanence, and Egyptian monuments were consciously designed to last for eternity. The origin of this obsession with monumentality was in the Western Desert, near the modern border between Egypt and Sudan. The remote spot is known to archaeologists as Nabta Playa. Today, a paved main road carves through the desert only a mile or two away, bringing construction traffic to Egypt's New Valley project. But until very recently, Nabta Playa was as far away from civilization as it was possible to get. Its main distinction was as a pit stop on the cross- country route between the desert springs of Bir Kiseiba and the shores of Lake Nasser. The flat bed of an ancient, dried-up lake-or playa-together with a nearby sandy ridge, certainly make Nabta an ideal spot for an overnight camp. There is, however, much more to the site than a casual first glance would suggest. Scattered throughout the landscape are large stones-not naturally occurring boulders but megaliths that had been hauled from some distance away and set up at key points around the edge of the playa. Some stand in splendid isolation, as sentinels on the horizon; others form a linear alignment. Most remarkable of all, on a slight elevation a series of stones has been set out in a circle, with pairs of uprights facing each other. Two pairs are aligned north to south, while two more point toward the midsummer sunrise.<br><br>Previously unknown and entirely unexpected, Nabta Playa has emerged from obscurity as the ancient Egyptian Stonehenge, a sacred landscape dotted with carefully placed stone structures. Scientific dating of the associated sediments has revealed a startlingly early date for these extraordinary monuments, the early fifth millennium b.c. At that time, as in even earlier periods, the Sahara would have been very different from its current arid state. On an annual basis, summer rains would have greened the desert-filling the seasonal lake, and turning its shores into lush pasture and arable land. The people who migrated to Nabta Playa to take advantage of this temporary abundance were seminomadic cattle herders who roamed with their livestock across a wide area of the eastern Sahara. Large quantities of cattle bones have been excavated at the site, and traces of human activity can be found scattered over the ground: fragments of ostrich eggshells (used as water carriers and, when broken, for making jewelry), flint arrowheads, stone axes, and grindstones for processing the cereals that were cultivated along the lakeshore. With its seasonal fertility, Nabta offered semi-nomadic people a fixed point of great symbolic significance, and over generations they set about transforming it into a ritual center. Laying out the stone alignments must have required a large degree of communal involvement. Like their counterparts at Stonehenge, the monuments of Nabta show that the local prehistoric people had developed a highly organized society. A pastoral way of life certainly needed wise decision-makers with a detailed knowledge of the environment, close familiarity with the seasons, and an acute sense of timing. Cattle are thirsty animals, requiring a fresh supply of water at the end of each day's wandering, so judging when to arrive at a site such as Nabta and when to leave again could have been a matter of life and death for the whole community.<br><br>The purpose of the standing stones and the "calendar circle" seems to have been to predict the arrival of the all-important rains that fell shortly after the summer solstice. When the rains arrived, the community celebrated by slaughtering some of their precious cattle as a sacrifice of thanks, and burying the animals in graves marked on the ground with large, flat stones. Under one such mound, archaeologists found not a cattle burial but a huge sandstone monolith that had been carefully shaped and dressed to resemble a cow. Dated, like the calendar circle, to the early fifth millennium b.c., it is the earliest known monumental sculpture from Egypt. Here are to be found the origins of pharaonic stone carving-in the prehistoric Western Desert, among wandering cattle herders, a millennium and more before the beginning of the First Dynasty. Archaeologists have been forced to rethink their theories of Egypt's origins.<br><br>On the other side of Egypt, in the Eastern Desert, equally remarkable discoveries have been made, confirming the impression that the arid lands bordering the Nile Valley were the crucible of ancient Egyptian civilization. Thousands of rock pictures pecked into the sandstone cliffs dot the dry valleys (known as wadis) that crisscross the hilly terrain between the Nile and the Red Sea hills. At some locations, usually associated with natural shelters, overhangs, or caves, there are great concentrations of pictures. One such tableau, by a dried-up plunge pool in the Wadi Umm Salam, has been likened to the Sistine Chapel. Its images constitute some of the earliest sacred art from Egypt, prefiguring the classic imagery of pharaonic religion by as much as a thousand years. Like their sculpture-loving counterparts at Nabta Playa, the prehistoric artists of the Eastern Desert seem also to have been cattle herders, and pictures of their livestock-and the wild animals they hunted out on the savanna-feature heavily in their compositions. But instead of using megaliths to signify their deepest beliefs, they exploited the smooth cliff faces offered by their own environment, turning them into canvases for religious expression. Gods traveling in sacred boats, and ritual hunts of wild animals, are key themes in the pharaonic iconography first attested in the Eastern Desert rock art. The inaccessible and inhospitable character of the region today belies its pivotal role in the rise of ancient Egypt.<br><br>Gathering speed<br><br>Ongoing survey and excavation at sites across the Western and Eastern deserts is revealing a pattern of close interaction between desert and valley peoples in prehistory. Rather unexpectedly, the semi- nomadic cattle herders who roamed across the prehistoric savanna seem to have been more advanced than their valley-dwelling contemporaries. But in a lesson for our own times, the cattle herders' vibrant way of life was made extinct by environmental change. Beginning in about 5000, the climate of northeast Africa began to undergo a marked shift. The once predictable summer rains that for millennia had provided cattle herders with seasonal pasture away from the Nile became steadily less reliable. Over a period of a few centuries, the rain belt moved progressively southward. (Today the rains, when they fall at all, fall over the highlands of Ethiopia.) The savannas to the east and west of the Nile began to dry out and turn to desert. After little more than a few generations, the desiccated land was no longer able to support thirsty herds of cattle. For the herders, the alternative to starvation was migration-to the only permanent water source in the region, the Nile Valley.<br><br>Here, the earliest settled communities, along the edge of the floodplain, had been established in the early fifth millennium b.c., broadly contemporary with the megalith builders of Nabta Playa. Like the cattle herders, the valley dwellers had also been practicing agriculture, but in contrast to the seasonality of rainfall in the arid regions, the regime of the Nile had made it possible to grow crops year-round. This would have given the valley dwellers the incentive and the wherewithal to occupy their villages on a permanent basis. The way of life the valley dwellers developed is known to Egyptologists as the Badarian culture, after the site of el-Badari, where this lifestyle was first recorded. The local vicinity was ideally suited to early habitation, with the juxtaposition of different ecosystems-floodplain and savanna-and excellent links to a wider hinterland. Desert routes led westward to the oases, while a major wadi ran eastward to the Red Sea coast. It was through these avenues that the Badarian way of life was strongly influenced by the early desert cultures.<br><br>One such influence, an interest in personal adornment, stayed with the ancient Egyptians throughout their history. Another development with long-term ramifications was the gradual stratification of society into leaders and followers, a small ruling class and a larger group of subjects. This was a system that owed much to the challenging lifestyle faced by pastoral seminomads. These external stimuli and internal dynamics began to transform Badarian society. Over many centuries, gradual changes took root and began to accelerate. The rich grew richer and began to act as patrons to a new class of specialist craftsmen. They, in turn, developed new technologies and new products to satisfy their patrons' ever more sophisticated tastes. The introduction of restricted access to prestige goods and materials further reinforced the power and status of the wealthiest in society.<br><br>The process of social transformation, once started, could not be stopped. Culturally, economically, and politically, prehistoric society became increasingly complex. Egypt was set on a course toward statehood. The final drying-out of the deserts around 3600 must have injected further momentum into this process. A sudden increase in population-when those living in the deserts migrated to the valley- may have led to greater competition for scarce resources, encouraging the development of walled towns. More mouths to feed would also have stimulated more productive agriculture. Urbanization and the intensification of farming were responses to social change but were also a stimulus to further change.<br><br>Under such conditions, communities in Upper Egypt began to coalesce into three regional groupings, each probably ruled by a hereditary monarch. Strategic factors help to explain the early dominance of these three prehistoric kingdoms. One kingdom was centered on the town of Tjeni (near modern Girga), a site where the floodplain narrowed and allowed the town's inhabitants to control river traffic. This area was also where trade routes from Nubia and the Saharan oases met the Nile Valley. A second territory had its capital at Nubt ("the golden," modern Nagada), which controlled access to gold mines in the Eastern Desert via the Wadi Hammamats on the opposite bank of the river. A third kingdom had grown up around the settlement of Nekhen, which, like Tjeni, was the starting point for a desert route to the oases (and thence to Sudan) and, like Nubt, controlled access to important Eastern Dese...</p><h2>Get Ready for the Code - Book a</h2><p>Get Ready for the CodeIntroduces consanants b, f, m, k, r, and t.</p><p></p><h2>Turkey Trouble</h2><p>childrens book, thanksgiving turkey</p><p></p><h2>National Audubon Society First Field Guide: Night Sky (Audubon Guides)</h2><p>This field guide for the world of astronomy helps children locate and identify stars, constellations, planets, phases of the moon, meteors, and comets, with sky maps and clear descriptions.

In late 2001, the Enron Corporation--a darling of the financial world, a company whose executives were friends of presidents and the powerful--imploded virtually overnight, leaving vast wreckage in its wake and sparking a criminal investigation that would last for years. But for all that has been written about the Enron debacle, no one has yet to re-create the full drama of what has already become a near-mythic American tale.<br><br>Until now. With <i>Conspiracy of Fools, </i>Kurt Eichenwald transforms the unbelievable story of the Enron scandal into a rip-roaring narrative of epic proportions, one that is sure to delight readers of thrillers and business books alike, achieving for this new decade what books like <i>Barbarians at the Gate </i>and <i>A Civil Action </i>accomplished in the 1990&#x2019;s.<br><br>Written in the roller-coaster style of a novel, the compelling narrative takes readers behind every closed door--from the Oval Office to the executive suites, from the highest reaches of the Justice Department to the homes and bedrooms of the top officers. It is a tale of global reach--from Houston to Washington, from Bombay to London, from Munich to Sao Paolo--laying out the unbelievable scenes that twisted together to create this shocking true story. <br><br>Eichenwald reveals never-disclosed details of a story that features a cast including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Paul O&#x2019;Neill, Harvey Pitt, Colin Powell, Gray Davis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Alan Greenspan, Ken Lay, Andy Fastow, Jeff Skilling, Bill Clinton, Rupert Murdoch and Sumner Redstone. With its you-are-there glimpse into the secretive worlds of corporate power, <i>Conspiracy of Fools</i> is an all-true financial and political thriller of cinematic proportions.</p><p>Enron was a $100-billion-a-year company in October 2001--America's seventh-largest. The Houston-based energy firm enjoyed warm ties with newly installed President George W. Bush. Earnings were up 26 percent from the previous quarter, while <i>Fortune</i> magazine had named Enron the country's most innovative company six years in a row. Less than two months later, Enron filed for bankruptcy in the biggest corporate failure in history. Enron became synonymous with the greed and fraud of the go-go high-tech stock bubble of the late 1990s--the worst of a series of spectacular corporate collapses that also took down WorldCom, Tyco, and Global Crossing. <p> What went wrong? Veteran <i>New York Times</i> financial journalist Kurt Eichenwald does an epic job of telling Enron's story in his 742-page tome <i>Conspiracy of Fools</i>. Eichenwald, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2000, also authored <i>The Informant</i>, an acclaimed account of a vast international price-fixing scandal at Archer Daniels Midland. <i>Conspiracy of Fools</i> tells the Enron tale with a cinematic narrative style, relying almost exclusively on scene and dialogue to bring his account to vivid life. We see how federal regulators opened the doors for the Enron fraud early on when they let the company loosen up its accounting rules and essentially cook its books. We read how Enron bullied Wall Street firms into issuing favorable reports about its share price by threatening to take away lucrative banking fees. Eichenwald also reveals how Enron manipulated electricity prices during the California energy crisis of 2000. Eichenwald's book is less successful in situating the Enron debacle in its wider context--the cycle of market speculation that reached a historic summit in the dot-com bubble. Was Enron just a cautionary sign of the greed and lack of ethics of a few bad apples, or was it more symptomatic of an entire market system? That may be a debate for another book. <i>--Alex Roslin</i></p><p>In 2000, when <i>The Informant</i> was published, few would've imagined that a story about price fixing at Archer Daniels Midland could be as un-put-downable as the best crime fiction. Yet critics&#x2014;and consumers&#x2014;agreed: <i>The New York Times</i> reporter Kurt Eichenwald had taken the stuff of dry business reporting and turned it into an unparalleled page-turner. With <i>Conspiracy of Fools</i>, Eichenwald has done it again.<br><br>Say the name "Enron" and most people believe they've heard all about the story that imperiled a presidency, destroyed a marketplace, and changed Washington and Wall Street forever. But in the hands of Kurt Eichenwald, the players we think we know and the business practices we think have been exposed are transformed into entirely new&#x2014;and entirely gripping&#x2014;material. The cast includes but is not limited to George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Paul O'Neill, Harvey Pitt, Colin Powell, Gray Davis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Alan Greenspan, Ken Lay, Andy Fastow, Jeff Skilling, Bill Clinton, Rupert Murdoch, and Michael Eisner. Providing a you-are-there glimpse behind closed doors in the executive suites of the Enron Corporation, the Texas governor's mansion, the Justice Department, and even the Oval Office, <i>Conspiracy of Fools</i> is an all-true financial and political thriller of cinematic proportions.</p></p><h2>Celtic Way of Prayer</h2><p>To explore and recover the Celtic roots of Christianity is to reclaim a forgotten heritage, one that will deepen and enrich our vision of the Christian faith. This book shows how the Celtic way of prayer draws on both the pre-Christian past and on the fullness of the Gospel. Also woven into the book is the liturgy, folklore, and history of the Celtic people. Here is prayer with the whole of one's self.<br><br>Esther de Waal introduces the reader to monastic prayer and praise (the foundation stone of Celtic Christianity), to early Irish litanies, to medieval Welsh praise poems, to the wealth of blessings that come from the oral tradition that made praying a part of daily living. We discover that this is not a dead tradition but a living spring, ancient and yet always new.</p><p>"In what will undoubtedly be a classic on Celtic spirituality and prayer, Esther de Waal leads her readers to a rediscovery of the beauty and richness of the Celtic way of life."<br>--Rosemary Rader, OSB<br><br>"What Esther has written is superb, because the combination of Esther's own spirituality and early Celtic spirituality is bound to be superb...I have read every word slowly, carefully, enjoying, being nourished.

It can, indeed, be our salvation."<br>--Madeleine L'Engle<br><br>"Esther de Waal's unique contribution to Celtic Christian studies is that she is never outside her subject.

And he is at all times eloquent."<br> -- Richard Ford<br><br>Following the overland triumph of <b>Bad Land</b>--whose prizes included the National Book Critics Circle Award--Jonathan Raban goes to sea.<br><br>The Inside Passage from Puget Sound to Alaska is winding, turbulent, and deep--an ancient, thousand-mile-long sea route, rich in dangerous whirlpools, eddies, rips, and races. Here flourished the canoe culture of the Northwest Indians, with their fantastic painted masks and complex iconography and their stories of malign submarine gods and monsters. The unhappy British ship Discovery, captained by George Vancouver, came through these open reaches and narrow chasms in 1792. The early explorers were quickly followed by fur traders, settlers, missionaries, anthropologists, fishermen, and tourists, each with their own designs on this intricate and haunted sea.<br><br>When Jonathan Raban set out alone in his own boat to sail from his Seattle home to the Alaskan Panhandle, he wanted to decode the many riddles and meanings of the sea: in Indian art and mythology, in the journals of Vancouver and his officers and midshipmen, in poetry and painting, in the physics of waves and turbulence. His voyage began as an intellectual adventure, but he soon found himself in deeper, more ominously personal waters than he had planned.<br>In this seaborne epic, Raban brings the past spectacularly alive and renders the present in a prose of sustained brilliance and humor. Exhilarating, panoramic, full of ideas, natural history, and mordant social observation, his journey into the wild heart of North America turns into a profound exploration of the wilderness of the human heart.</p><p>British-born Jonathan Raban sets out on a passage from Seattle to Juneau in a small boat that is more a waterborne writing den, and as usual with the brilliant Raban, this journey becomes a vehicle for history and heart-stopping descriptions that will make readers want to hail him as one of the finest talents who's picked up a pen in the 20th century. The voyage through the Inside Passage from Washington's Puget Sound to Alaska churns up memories and stirs up hidden emotions and Raban dwells on many, including the death of his father and his own role of Daddy to his young daughter, Julia, left behind in Seattle. More than just a personal travelogue, however, <i>Passage to Juneau</i> deftly weaves in the stories of others before him--from Indians whom white men formerly greeted with baubles set afloat on logs, to Captain Vancouver, who risked mutiny on his ship when he banned visits with prostitutes, some of whom offered their services for bits of scrap metal. Pressed into every page are intimate descriptions of life at sea--the fog-shrouded coasts, the crackly radio that keeps him linked to the mainland, the salty marine air, and the fellow sailors who are likewise drawn by a life of tossing on water. While Raban successfully steers his boat to the desired port, readers ultimately discover that this insightful, talented sage is in fact emotionally in deep water and may not fully be captain of his own life. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i><br>A conversation with Jonathan Raban, author of Passage to Juneau: A Sea and Its Meanings<br><br>Q: You're a Brit living in America, writing passionately and brilliantly about this country. How did your kinship with the U.S. begin, and how has it evolved from book to book?<br>A: For "kinship" read "bewildered fascination." Oh, it began in infancy, in Norfolk, England in the last days of World War II. There was an American air force base just down the road from where we lived. Americans - larger in every way than the scrawny English after five years of wartime rationing - rode past our house in open armored cars, tossing sticks of gum from their PX , and the village kids scrabbled for them in the dirt. I wasn't a village kid, and to my enormous disappointment, my mother forbade me from joining the melee. But I have made up for that since. First, in my early teens, I was besotted by American rock music - Bill Haley and his Comets, Frankie Lymon, Elvis Presley... Then came American novels. Huckleberry Finn was a childhood favorite, then Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, then, when I was at university, the novels of Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, the young Philip Roth. The poems of Robert Lowell (whom I later came to know). These were liberating influences. Postwar British fiction and poetry seemed terribly dry by comparison to these wonderfully fluent, extravagant Americans. My first job - long before I had set foot in the U.S. - was teaching American literature at the University College of Wales, then at the University of East Anglia. So when I came to visit this country for the first time (in 1972, when I took up a visiting professorship at Smith College, in Northampton, Mass), I had been living in a richly populated imaginary America for a long time. I continue to live in that strange world now. I think that only the reader can judge how it has evolved in my books.<br><br>Q: You've traveled down the Mississippi in a 16-foot boat (Old Glory), roamed from place to place around the country in Hunting Mister Heartbreak, explored eastern Montana and western North Dakota in Bad Land. How do you choose your destinations? Where else in the U.S. would you like to write about?<br>A: Old Glory and Hunting Mister Heartbreak were books written (mostly) from England about a foreign land. But in Bad Land I was trying to write about home, trying to make imaginative sense of the lives of an earlier generation of European immigrants, using their experience to inform mine, and vice-versa. Going to Ismay, Montana wasn't a journey, or a destination, that I chose; it chose me, because my friend, like many people who finally found their way to Seattle, had come from there, and I wanted to borrow his family history for my own. If I could plant my feet in the shoes of his grandparents, and look out through their eyes, I thought I might be able to make better sense of my own situation here... I see Bad Land as the first book in a loose trilogy about living here in the Pacific Northwest; Passage to Juneau continues and elaborates the theme. The third book, a novel, will be set right here, in Seattle.<br><br>Q: Tell us how you came to write Passage to Juneau.<br>A: Bad Land was really a sea-story, about shipwreck, set a thousand miles inland on the dry prairies. Writing it, I came to see that there was another story I wanted to explore, really a land-story set at sea. Since 1990 (when I came to live in Seattle), I had been spending as much time as I could sailing around Washington and British Columbia, mostly on the waters of the Inside Passage, but also venturing out into the open Pacific, off the coast of Vancouver Island. The more I sailed, and sopped up the lore of our tricky local sea, the more I saw that the water here was a "place", as full of intricacy and character as any sweep of land. For the coastal Indians, the surface of the sea was their primary workplace - it was where they fished, fought their wars, traded goods, met their wives and husbands... They had names for every feature of the water - many more names for the sea than they had for the surrounding land. The cedar canoe was their equivalent of the horse and carriage, or the Ford Taurus. To understand the true history of the Northwest, the essential character of this landscape, you have to get into the mindset of a canoe-Indian, and learn to see the water as a place, with the forests and mountains as mostly undifferentiated space.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I needed to sail to Alaska in order to understand this other, watery dimension of my new home. I wanted to take my place in that floating cavalcade of Indians, white explorers, fishermen, missionaries, anthropologists, loggers, tourists, and everyone else for whom the water here has been important. I wanted to explore the many meanings of the sea by focusing on the sea in my own backyard - a sea providentially rich in history and significance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I thought that writing a waterborne book, set along the 1000-mile length of the Inside Passage, would be a good way - as Bad Land had been - of putting down my own roots here, and making myself belong to this landscape. That was before I made the voyage - which, as it turned out, damned near uprooted me altogether...<br><br>Q: In Passage to Juneau, you write about your journey from Seattle to Alaska; Captain Vancouver covered the same territory in 1792-1794, a voyage that you describe vividly. Tell us about Captain Van, and his trials and tribulations.<br>A: My alter ego. Short, fat, unwell, pop-eyed, socially inadequate. I am intensely fond of him. Humanly, he was a dry stick; an old fogey at 34. He was saddled with a bunch of fashionable, upper-class midshipmen, who despised him. He was perfectly out of touch with the great movements of his time. The Romantic glory of wilderness quite passed him by. What he would have liked to discover here was a sort of far-western version of Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey. What he found was a country of hideous and gloomy mountains, ugly cascades, depressing forests, and a sea of baffling tides and ship-swallowing whirlpools. He was the Pacific Northwest's least likely immigrant...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But he supplies a wonderful pair of eyes for a writer to look out through - he's a far more interesting character than the young fashionables, who were able to see the Northwestern wilderness as the apotheosis of the Romantic Sublime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"Sublime? Bah!" says Captain Van, whose invariable descriptive term for craggy, snowcapped mountains was "sterile". He was a brilliant navigator and map-maker, but grimly literal-minded when it came to people and landscape. In the book, he's a foil to everyone, from the midshipmen, to Wordsworth and Shelley, and John Muir, and me. I mustn't make him sound like a monster, for he's utterly sympathetic in his unhappiness -- and I think it was profound -- at finding himself here.<br><br>Q: Have you always been adventurous, the kind of person for whom travel and exploration are crucial to survival?<br>A: What? I think you've got the wrong writer. I am timid in the extreme. My travels, such as they are, are safe and unadventurous. I travel furthest and deepest in libraries, not over the water or over the ground. I've never climbed a proper mountain, never crossed an ocean under my own steam, or sail. I am sedentary and bookish by nature; a stay-at-home. I think you must have been thinking of Jon Krakauer.<br><br>Q: You capture the American psyche through its people and places. Do you find it easy to walk into a place you've never been and get people to open up? Is that just part of being a writer?<br>A: I do a lot of looking, and a good deal of listening. I never "interview" people. But being alone on a journey for any stretch of time makes one hungry for company, and I am always grateful for whatever scraps of conversation come my way. I don't go searching for "characters," but I enjoy chance encounters with anyone who happens to cross my path...not very many in Passage to Juneau, when three and four days would go by without my speaking to another soul. So I kept company with Captain Van, and Franz Boas, and long-dead Indian storytellers, and William Wordsworth...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>But the question raises another one, about characters-in-a-landscape. I'm passionately interested in the relationship between the character one is and the landscape in which that character is formed. I know I'm a different person living here in Seattle from the man I used to be who lived in London, and I think that character is essentially fluid; it alters according to the circumstances in which it finds itself. I wonder what you'd become if I took you away from New York and installed you alone on an Alaskan island? It's an experiment that I'd like to conduct. So talking with people, seeing them in their natural habitat, as it were, I always find myself discovering a lot of their landscape in their character, and something of their character in the landscape itself. As an expatriate, living in a landscape that still feels subtly alien to me after nearly ten years, I'm acutely aware of this continual exchange between landscape and character, and of the gulf between people who are at home in their landscape - whether it's the Upper West Side or a fish-camp in British Columbia - and people like me, who are never quite at home anywhere.<br><br>Q: Where does your passion for sailing come from?<br>A: It's not a passion for sailing. I've always been fascinated by water, especially by the movements of water...ripples, eddies, waves, turbulence. Water in motion is the best model of chaos as physicists use that term. Look at a tide flowing through a narrow passage between islands - its rips, boils, whirlpools, overfalls - and you're face to face with chaos. There's something about the idea of a boat afloat on turbulent water that excites me, partly for its own sake, partly as a metaphor. As for sailing, it's mostly quiet, slow, meditative; an ideal way to study the water and watch the land. Hitching a free ride on the breeze, you feel a part of the nature that you sail through. A car detaches you from the landscape; a sailboat immerses you in it. My boat - a rather elderly ketch, 35 feet long, built in Sweden in 1972 - serves as an observation platform, a mobile library, a floating country cottage. It's my second home.<br><br>Q: Your knowledge of Northwest tribal art and mythology is impressive. How did you do the research, and was this uncharted territory for you before you started to write Passage to Juneau?<br>A: I've been looking at Indian art and reading Indian stories since I first came here in 1990. The penny suddenly dropped for me in the summer of 1990, when the boat was tied up in Victoria harbor, at the south end of Vancouver Island. I had spent most of an afternoon gazing at Indian masks and painted chests in the Royal British Columbia Museum. The weather was sultry and windless. When I went back to the boat I sat out in the cockpit, staring at the water, which was oily-calm, faintly rippled by the leftover wakes of float planes and motor boats. Fragmentary reflections kept on dissolving and reforming in the mirror-surface of the water, and I realized that I'd spent all afternoon looking at an art of watery reflections just like these: the Kwakiutl Indians were representing life as it was reflected by the ripples and wavelets of their native sea... Since then, I've haunted places like the Museum of Natural History in New York and the Menil<br>Collection in Houston, in pursuit of this stylized, extraordinarily dramatic maritime art of the Northwest coast. I don't think of it as "research." I do it for my own pleasure. With Indian stories ("myths" is a dubious word for them), it's been a little different. I'm a literary critic by training, and I was fascinated by the structural oddity of the stories collected by Boas and others; their version of narrative - of what happens when, and how - struck me as alien and bizarre. So I tried to learn to read them, not as anthropologists do, milking them for their encoded information about the culture, but as a sympathetic critic, getting in tune with their world, listening for subtexts and ironies. They figure importantly in the book.<br><br>Q: I'm not sure what kind of book Passage to Juneau is. Is it a memoir, a travel book, a social history? What is it?<br>A: Those damned categories! Luckily, they're more of a concern for librarians than they are for writers, or for readers. I've always been interested in books that slip and slide between the genres. Like Bruce Chatwin's Songlines - which was published as a novel in England, but under the non-fiction rubric of "Australia - description and travel" in the U.S. Or Thomas Kenneally's Schindler's Ark, published here as History, but which in England won the Booker Prize for Fiction. Or, most recently, that lovely book by W.G. Sebald, The Rings of Saturn, which you could label as a travelogue, or a personal memoir, or a meditation on English and German history. It's all of those things, but Sebald calls it "a novel," for want of a better word. Passage to Juneau is like that - a braid of memoir, history, travel, anthropology, art and literary criticism...all of those things, and none of them, at the same time. What I hope is that it is a lucid narrative, and to hell with the genres.<br><br>Q: You dedicate your book to your daughter Julia; we met her in Passage to Juneau, and seemed like a curious and adventurous three-and-a-half year old. Has Julia taken up sailing yet?<br>A: Not with quite the avid enthusiasm that I'd like to see. She'll be seven in November, and she has omnivorous social appetites. I have to fill the boat with other people before she really enjoys it. I'm reassured to see that she hasn't inherited my eccentric taste for solitude.<br><br>Q: What's next for Jonathan Raban?<br>A: A book set in Seattle, to be published as a novel. I began as a fiction writer, but haven't written a novel since 1985, when Foreign Land came out. The novel has always been the quintessential mixed genre, boiling up the real and the imaginary in the same pot. So there's a lot of reality in the book I'm working on. Seattle is a real - or at least a virtual - city. Bill Gates - I believe -exists. And so do people like Nathan Myrhvold and Jeff Bezos. They'll be in the book, rubbing shoulders on equal terms with people you won't find in any phone book, and who are quite unknown to the I.R.S. and the Social Security Administration.</p><h2>Winters&#39; Tales: Stories and Observations for the Unusual</h2><p>In this collection of stories and vignettes, the celebrated comedian recalls his difficult childhood in Ohio, his rise to stardom in the 1950s, his serious health problems, and other personal tales</p><p>Jonathan Winters was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1925. After serving with the marines in the South Pacific for two and a half years, he studied at Kenyon College and the Dayton Art Institute. Soon thereafter he won a local talent contest, which led to a job as a radio disc jockey. By the mid-fifties, he had moved from the airwaves to the stage, becoming a staple at nightclubs throughout America. Regular television appearances followed, notably on the Garry Moore and Steve Allen shows, and especially on Jack Paar&#39;s programs for NBC. His own TV series, The Jonathan Winters Show, first aired in 1956. As an actor, Winters has starred in such acclaimed films as It&#39;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, Oh Dad, Poor Dad and Tony Richardson&#39;s classic The Loved One, as well as the popular television series Mork and Mindy. Today, he continues to make frequent television and motion picture appearances, performs solo concerts, shows his paintings and drawings in galleries throughout the country and is writing his autobiography.

They had met in 1976 as freshman college roommates. Before they became established in their careers, they "sketched their way across America" as art hobos, hopping freight cars, finding adventure, and drawing, drawing, drawing. Much of this attitude and some of this biography made its way into the book, The Artist's Guide to Sketching -- a book firmly committed to the idea that artists need to get outdoors -- into the real world -- and draw from life. ABOUT THIS BOOK -- This is not a traditional "how to" book. The authors place a lot of emphasis on using the environment to capture mood and say that the sketching artist must allow his feelings and impressions to show themselves in the finished work. Sketching isn't rendering. It is expressing feelings. TOPICS COVERED IN THE BOOK -- Realities of sketching outdoors; materials; accuracy; creating mood; sketching people; sketching man-made objects; capturing motion; sketch vs. a study; the sketchbook as a chronicle of the artist's daily life. BOOK DETAILS -- hardback with dustjacket; cloth over boards with a sewn binding; 160 pp; b&amp;w illustrations throughout.</p><p></p><h2>Norman Rockwell: My Adventures As an Illustrator</h2><p>The author recounts his life and career, describes the stories behind some of his most famous works, and shows a selection of paintings, studies, and sketches</p><p></p><h2>Iceberg</h2><p>In the popular author&#39;s first hardcover, Dirk Pitt hunts down--with the help of a beautiful Icelandic woman--an elusive, God-playing multibillionaire and a priceless cargo that could annihilate nations. Reissue.</p><p>Just seventy-two hours ago, Dirk Pitt was lying in the hot California sun with a beautiful woman, a Scotch-rocks in one hand, but an urgent call from Admiral James Sandecker, his commander at the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), brings Pitt out of the warm Pacific breezes and straight into a North Atlantic deep freeze. The reason: the dis- covery of a long-missing luxury yacht, en route to a secret White House rendezvous, frozen solid in a mil- lion-ton tombstone of ice. Tunneling his way into the core of the berg, Pitt comes upon a gruesome scene -- a crew of corpses, hor- ribly incinerated at their posts -- but the vessel&#39;s price- less cargo, which could alter the balance of world power and put the threat of annihilation at America&#39;s doorstep, has vanished. This discovery is the springboard from which Clive Cussler -- The Grand Master of Adventure -- launches a compelling and powerful story that takes Dirk Pitt from the remote, uninhabited tundra of Iceland to the frigid abyss of the North Atlantic, determined to force his deadly, unseen opponent -- a multibillionaire in the business of playing God -- to make his next move. But first Pitt will have to penetrate the shroud of mystery concealing a titanic network of international financial intrigue -- and mass murder. Lives, nations, continents are at stake. And although his enemies may have the firepower as always, Dirk Pitt has the skill and the daring, the ruth- lessness and resourcefulness to meet it. He also has Kirsti Fyrie, an Icelandic beauty whose twin brother died on the ice-encased yacht and who carries in her heart the secret that Pitt needs to destroy his opponents in this deadly game. Iceberg is classic Cussler.Clive Cussler grew up in Alhambra, California. He later attended Pasadena City College for two years, but then enlisted in the Air Force during the Korean War where he served as an aircraft mechanic and flight engineer in the Military Air Transport Service. Upon his discharge, he became a copywriter and later creative director for two leading ad agencies. At that time, he wrote and produced radio and television commercials that won numerous international awards one at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. He began writing in 1965 and published his first novel featuring Dirk Pitt (R) in 1973.

Reader&#39;s Guide available. Reprint. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Written in the present tense, <i>First They Killed My Father</i> will put you right in the midst of the action--action you'll wish had never happened. It's a tough read, but definitely a worthwhile one, and the author's personality and strength shine through on every page. Covering the years from 1975 to 1979, the story moves from the deaths of multiple family members to the forced separation of the survivors, leading ultimately to the reuniting of much of the family, followed by marriages and immigrations. The brutality seems unending--beatings, starvation, attempted rape, mental cruelty--and yet the narrator (a young girl) never stops fighting for escape and survival. Sad and courageous, her life and the lives of her young siblings provide quite a powerful example of how war can so deeply affect children--especially a war in which they are trained to be an integral part of the armed forces. For anyone interested in Cambodia's recent history, this book shares a valuable personal view of events. <i>--Jill Lightner</i><p>One of seven children of a high-ranking government official, Loung Ung lived a privileged life in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh until the age of five.

Loung was trained as a child soldier in a work camp for orphans, her siblings were sent to labor camps, and those who survived the horrors would not be reunited until the Khmer Rouge was destroyed.</p><p>Harrowing yet hopeful, Loung's powerful story is an unforgettable account of a family shaken and shattered, yet miraculously sustained by courage and love in the face of unspeakable brutality.</p></p><h2>The Glass Bead Game: Magister Ludi</h2><p>In the remote Kingdom of Castalia, the scholars of the Twenty Third century play the Glass Bead Game.

Originally from Idaho, she studied at Brigham Young University and lived in Delaware and New Jersey before settling down in Salt Lake City, Utah. She had been a movie store clerk, librarian, bookseller, and school office lady before she got her big break.

The magic that forced all 12 princesses to dance incessantly is reversed, and Poppy is sent for a respite to Seadown House, where the last thing she wishes to do is attend parties to dance. It is there that she encounters a maid whose misfortune has landed her in her present state of servitude after losing her family, inheritance, and stature as the daughter of an Earl. Ellen is not the best maid&#x2013;she's resentful, clumsy, awkward, inept, and quite useless, often causing accidents and irreparable damage. She misses her upper-class socializing, so when an important invitation to a ball arrives at Seadown, Ellen is determined to go with the aid of a nefarious godmother, &#x201c;the Corley,&#x201d; who is also responsible for the wickedly construed misfortunes in Princess Poppy's family. George weaves in elements from the first novel in a somewhat convoluted and drawn-out narrative in which the evil magic is finally conquered through Poppy's knowledge and previous experience. This Cinderella story serves more as a subplot to the action surrounding the principal character and pales in comparison to Diane Stanley's Bella at Midnight (HarperCollins, 2006), Donna Jo Napoli's Bound (S &amp; S, 2004), or Gail Carson Levine's Ella Enchanted (HarperCollins, 1997).<i>Rita Soltan, Youth Services Consultant, West Bloomfield, MI</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

However, the allure of his previous hedonistic pursuits has paled. Then he learns of the mission his brother, Sebastian, and Lady Antonia Rawlings have been assisting with and volunteers to assist by hunting down the hoard of gunpowder now secreted somewhere in London. Michael sets out to trace the carters who transported the gunpowder from Kent to London. His quest leads him to the Hendon Shipping Company, where he discovers his sole source of information is the only daughter of Jack and Kit Hendon, Miss Cleome Hendon, who although a fetchingly attractive lady, firmly holds the reins of the office in her small hands. Cleo has fought to achieve her position in the company. Initially, managing the office was a challenge, but she now conquers all in just a few hours a week. With her three brothers all adventuring in America, she&#x2019;s been driven to the realization that she craves adventure, too. When Michael Cynster walks in and asks about carters, Cleo&#x2019;s instincts leap. She wrings from him the full tale of his mission&#x2014;and offers him a bargain. She will lead him to the carters he seeks if he agrees to include her as an equal partner in the mission.

Then she delivers on her part of the bargain, and he finds there are benefits to allowing her to continue to investigate beside him&#x2014;not least being that if she&#x2019;s there, then he knows she&#x2019;s safe.

But in the past fifteen years, a revolutionary new standard of measurement&#x2014;sabermetrics&#x2014;has been embraced by front offices in Major League Baseball and among fantasy baseball enthusiasts. But while sabermetrics is recognized as being smarter and more accurate, traditionalists, including journalists, fans, and managers, stubbornly believe that the "old" way&#x2014;a combination of outdated numbers and "gut" instinct&#x2014;is still the best way. Baseball, they argue, should be run by <em>people</em>, not by <em>numbers.</em></p><p>In this informative and provocative book, the renowned ESPN analyst and senior baseball writer demolishes a century&#x2019;s worth of accepted wisdom, making the definitive case against the long-established view. Armed with concrete examples from different eras of baseball history, logic, a little math, and lively commentary, he shows how the allegiance to these numbers&#x2014;dating back to the beginning of the professional game&#x2014;is firmly rooted not in accuracy or success, but in baseball&#x2019;s irrational adherence to tradition. </p><p>While Law gores sacred cows, from clutch performers to RBIs to the infamous save rule, he also demystifies sabermetrics, explaining what these "new" numbers really are and why they&#x2019;re vital. He also considers the game&#x2019;s future, examining how teams are using Data&#x2014;from PhDs to sophisticated statistical databases&#x2014;to build future rosters; changes that will transform baseball and all of professional sports. </p></p><p><p>For the past fifteen years, many baseball fans, writers, and commentators have remained mired in the muck of old statistics&#x2014;baseball card numbers such as batting average, saves recorded, and a pitcher&#x2019;s won-lost record&#x2014;while newer, smarter, and at times counterintuitive baseball stats known as sabermetrics have become commonplace throughout Major League Baseball. Yet, despite their popularity, confusion persists about these new stats, with much of the baseball world still following the &#x201c;old&#x201d; way&#x2014;a combination of those outdated numbers and gut instinct&#x2014;to evaluate players&#x2019; contributions and careers. Baseball, they argue, should be run by people, not by numbers.</p><p>ESPN senior baseball writer Keith Law, respectfully, or perhaps not so respectfully, disagrees. In this provocative book, the outspoken Law takes on the established view of baseball stats, undermining over a century&#x2019;s worth of baseball dogma. With many of these numbers dating back to the beginning of the game, he examines how allegiance to these old stats is firmly rooted, not in the modern game as it&#x2019;s played, but in baseball&#x2019;s irrational adherence to tradition. Using entertaining anecdotes, logic, and occasionally just a little math, he exposes the flaws in much of the game&#x2019;s orthodoxy, from the illusion of clutch performers, to the dishonesty of RBIs, to how the save rule&#x2014;invented by a journalist&#x2014;has ruined bullpens for decades.&nbsp;</p><p>But <em>Smart Baseball</em> is not just about tearing down tradition.&nbsp; Law also offers a clear-eyed discussion of the new stats that are helping teams win, changing how players are valued, and altering how we talk about the game. Exploring long-underappreciated numbers like On-Base Percentage, as well as newer stats like Win Probability Added and Wins Above Replacement, he simplifies the math that has gotten in the way for many curious fans, providing understandable explanations of what these numbers measure and why they work better.&nbsp; In addition he delves into the future of baseball stats, uncovering the escalating arms race for statistical talent being waged by almost every MLB front office, as the teams search for innovative ways to find the statistical edge on and off the field. &nbsp;</p><p>What emerges is an intelligent, informative, and engaging assault on the baseball establishment. Brought to life by Law&#x2019;s unapologetic style, <em>Smart Baseball</em> is an iconoclastic look at the numbers game of baseball, proving why some of the most trusted stats are surprisingly wrong, detailing the numbers that actually work, and revealing what the rise of Big Data means for the future of the sport. </p>Keith Law is a senior baseball&nbsp;writer&nbsp;for ESPN Insider and an analyst for ESPN's Baseball Tonight, focusing on all types of baseball analysis.

His search for his wife (and his cat) introduces him to a bizarre collection of characters, including two psychic sisters, a possibly unbalanced teenager, an old soldier who witnessed the massacres on the Chinese mainland at the beginning of the Second World War, and a very shady politician.<p> Haruki Murakami is a master of subtly disturbing prose. Mundane events throb with menace, while the bizarre is accepted without comment. Meaning always seems to be just out of reach, for the reader as well as for the characters, yet one is drawn inexorably into a mystery that may have no solution. <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> is an extended meditation on themes that appear throughout Murakami's earlier work. The tropes of popular culture, movies, music, detective stories, combine to create a work that explores both the surface and the hidden depths of Japanese society at the end of the 20th century.</p><p> If it were possible to isolate one theme in <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>, that theme would be responsibility. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China keep rising to the surface like a repressed memory, and Toru Okada himself is compelled by events to take responsibility for his actions and struggle with his essentially passive nature. If Toru is supposed to be a Japanese Everyman, steeped as he is in Western popular culture and ignorant of the secret history of his own nation, this novel paints a bleak picture. Like the winding up of the titular bird, Murakami slowly twists the gossamer threads of his story into something of considerable weight. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>Japan's most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets of World War II. <br>In a Tokyo suburb a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife's missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria. <br>Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.</p><h2>The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, &amp; Indian Allies</h2><p>In this deeply researched and clearly written book, the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning historian Alan Taylor tells the riveting story of a war that redefined North America. During the early nineteenth century, Britons and Americans renewed their struggle over the legacy of the American Revolution. Soldiers, immigrants, settlers, and Indians fought in a northern borderland to determine the fate of a continent. Would revolutionary republicanism sweep the British from Canada? Or would the British empire contain, divide, and ruin the shaky American republic?<br><br>In a world of double identities, slippery allegiances, and porous boundaries, the leaders of the republic and of the empire struggled to control their own diverse peoples. The border divided Americans&#x2014;former Loyalists and Patriots&#x2014;who fought on both sides in the new war, as did native peoples defending their homelands. Serving in both armies, Irish immigrants battled one another, reaping charges of rebellion and treason. And dissident Americans flirted with secession while aiding the British as smugglers and spies.<br><br>During the war, both sides struggled to sustain armies in a northern land of immense forests, vast lakes, and stark seasonal swings in the weather. In that environment, many soldiers panicked as they fought their own vivid imaginations, which cast Indians as bloodthirsty savages. After fighting each other to a standstill, the Americans and the British concluded that they could safely share the continent along a border that favored the United States at the expense of Canadians and Indians. Both sides then celebrated victory by forgetting their losses and by betraying the native peoples.<br><br>A vivid narrative of an often brutal (and sometimes comic) war that reveals much about the tangled origins of the United States and Canada.</p><p>Born and raised in Maine, Alan Taylor teaches American and Canadian history at the University of California, Davis. His books include <i>The Divided Ground,</i> <i>Writing Early American History,</i> <i>American Colonies,</i> and <i>William Cooper&#x2019;s Town,</i> which won the Bancroft and Pulitzer prizes for American history.

The game was physical, bruising and attritional, based on strength over speed, aggression over finesse.

[He] describes the frantic rescue efforts . . . and the malevolent, unending storm. In a thrilling, climactic chapter, he conjures forth the avalanche."<i>&#x2015;The New York Times</i></b></p><p>In February 1910, a monstrous, record-breaking blizzard hit the Northwest. Nowhere was the danger more terrifying than near a tiny town called Wellington, perched high in the Cascade Mountains, where a desperate situation evolved: two trainloads of cold, hungry passengers and their crews found themselves marooned. For days, an army of the Great Northern Railroad's most dedicated men worked to rescue the trains, but just when escape seemed possible, the unthinkable occurred&#x2015;a colossal avalanche tumbled down, sweeping the trains over the steep slope and down the mountainside. Centered on the astonishing spectacle of our nation's deadliest avalanche, <i>The White Cascade </i>is the masterfully told story of a never-before-documented tragedy.</p></p><p><b>Gary Krist </b>is the prizewinning author of the novels <i>Bad Chemistry</i>, <i>Chaos Theory</i>, and <i>Extravagance</i>, and the short-story collections, <i>The Garden State </i>and <i>Bone by Bone</i>. His stories, articles, and travel pieces have been featured in noteworthy magazines, including <i>National Geographic Traveler</i>, <i>GQ</i>, and <i>Esquire</i>. He lives in Bethesda, Maryland, with his wife and daughter.Prologue<p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Late Thaw</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Summer 1910</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The last body was found at the end of July, twenty-one weeks after the avalanche. Workmen clearing debris from the secluded site, high in the cool, still snow-flecked Cascades, discovered the deteriorating corpse in a creek at the mountainside&#x2019;s base. Trapped under piles of splintered timber, the dead man had to be Archibald McDonald, a twenty-three-year-old brakeman, the only person on the trains not yet accounted for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bill J. Moore was on the wrecker crew that found him. Moore&#x2019;s team was one of many that had been grappling with the hard, ugly work at Wellington over the previous five months. For the first few days following the avalanche&#x2014;after the storm had finally tapered off and the isolated town could be reached&#x2014;the men had done little but dig for victims in the snow. Bodies were scattered all over the mountainside, some buried as deep as forty feet. Once located, they had to be piled up&#x2014;&#x201c;like cordwood, in 4-by-4 stacks&#x201d;&#x2014;and carried to a makeshift morgue in the station&#x2019;s baggage room, where they could be identified. Wrapped in blankets and tied to rugged Alaskan sleds, they&#x2019;d been evacuated in small groups, each sled maneuvered by four men with ropes, two ahead and two behind, in silent procession down to their mourning families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the dead were gone, the crews had turned to opening and fortifying the right-of-way, blasting away acres of compacted snow and timber, laying the groundwork for huge concrete shelters to protect the rail line from future snowslides. Temporary spur tracks had been built along the side of the ravine so that the wreckers could begin their recovery work. Some of the train equipment, like the heavy steam and electric locomotives, had been only lightly damaged, but the wooden mail cars, sleepers, and passenger coaches were completely shattered. Each scrap had to be hoisted back up to the tracks and carted off on a flatcar. The job had taken weeks. All that remained in the ravine afterward, strewn among rocks and ravaged trees, were a few twisted metal pipes, a ruptured firebox door, a woman&#x2019;s torn, high-buttoned shoe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For nineteen-year-old Bill Moore, the unearthing of the final victim would mean yet another funeral to attend, yet another lost friend to lay to rest. Moore had often worked with Archie &#x201c;Mac&#x201d; McDonald, a fellow brakeman. The Great Northern Railway&#x2019;s Cascade Division was full of men like Moore and McDonald. Regarded as something of a hardship post, the division was often avoided by those with the seniority to land positions elsewhere, and it employed more than its share of young rookies. Rootless and unattached, they had to find family wherever they could.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So Moore, like many others, had found it among his fellow railroaders. There was a good reason why railway unions were called &#x201c;Brotherhoods&#x201d;; trainmen in the Age of Steam regarded themselves as a breed apart, united by their rough and highly specialized work. In this remote, dangerous territory, where the daily battle against the elements required the highest levels of teamwork, trust, and personal sacrifice, these bonds were especially strong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the men of the Cascade Division, the Wellington Disaster thus represented the decimation of an entire close-knit community. Although newspaper reports had given far more ink to the trains&#x2019; lost passengers (business leaders, women, and children made better copy), nearly two-thirds of the fatalities had come from a relatively small population of trainmen, railway mail clerks, and track laborers. Among them had been several whom Moore considered close friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To those who had escaped, one question was unavoidable: Why them and not me? On the night of the avalanche, Moore had been down at Skykomish station, at the foot of the mountains. His train&#x2014;the last westbound freight to make it over the mountain&#x2014;had tied up there when the storm reached its critical stage, immobilizing all traffic throughout the range. Had his schedule or the storm&#x2019;s timing been slightly different, it might have been his train trapped for six full days, his body entombed in snow. Such an arbitrary twist of fate was difficult to get over. As Moore would later write: &#x201c;I will never forget this as long as I live.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Others were less inclined to accept what had happened as fate. Tragedy, they claimed, was not the ending this story had to have. Four days before the terrible events of March 1&#x2014;shortly after the two trains had become marooned at Wellington station, just below the very summit spine of the Cascades&#x2014;the passengers and crews had received a stark portent of what was to come. A chef and his assistant, working overnight in a railway beanery at a nearby station, had just put the next day&#x2019;s biscuits into the oven to bake. Outside, the &#x201c;howling, cantankerous blizzard&#x201d; that had been raging for days was pummeling the surrounding mountains, rattling the doors of the beanery in their frames. Sometime around 4:00 a.m., in a narrow gully high above the station, the overloaded snowpack began to falter. Within seconds, a torrent of loose snow began slipping down the gully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the flow quickly broadened and deepened, it gathered momentum, fanning out into a rolling, churning river of white headed straight for the station below. Surging onto the valley floor, the powerful slide grazed a corner of the depot and twisted the entire building off its foundation. But the beanery stood directly in its path. Hit point-blank by the rushing wall of snow, the rough wooden structure imploded, its timbers rupturing, its roof collapsing to the ground under the intense weight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For many hours afterward, rescuers digging at the site could find only one of the two dead men inside, though they managed to recover several hot biscuits from the oven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next few days, as the railroad fought desperately to clear the tracks, slides began falling everywhere. The Pacific Northwest had been inundated with heavy snows for days, and as the weather warmed and the snowfall turned to rain, mountains across the region shrugged off their heavy loads. In the mining country of Idaho, two huge avalanches smashed the sleeping towns of Mace and Burke. A landslide near Seattle annihilated a horse barn, trapping six animals inside and wedging the head of an eighty-year-old rancher under a crosscut saw. Snow shearing off another slope swept a small house into a ravine, the two terrified men inside riding the plummeting cabin like a bobsled for three hundred feet. And in British Columbia, a railroad gang near Rogers Pass was engulfed by an even more massive slide, leaving scores of foreign workers dead, some of them frozen upright in casual postures&#x2014;&#x201c;like the dead of Pompeii.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the midst of this, Great Northern Railway trains Nos. 25 and 27 sat paralyzed at Wellington, slowly being buried under the snow. The men of the Cascade Division made Herculean, round-the-clock efforts to release them, but, as the Seattle Times would report, &#x201c;so fierce is the storm that the attempts of this army of workmen, aided by all the available snow-fighting machinery on the division, are futile.&#x201d; The stress, meanwhile, was taking its toll: &#x201c;Passengers by Sunday were in a frantic state of mind,&#x201d; one survivor would later report. &#x201c;It was with difficulty that we could keep the women and children . . . from becoming actually sick in bed from the long strain.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Suffering most acutely was Ida Starrett, a young widowed mother from Spokane. Her husband, a Great Northern freight conductor, had been killed just weeks before at the railroad&#x2019;s main yards in Hillyard, Washington. Having settled his estate, Ida was now traveling with her elderly parents to start anew in Canada. In her care were her three children&#x2014;nine-year-old Lillian, seven-year-old Raymond, and an infant boy, Francis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two other families were in similar straits. The Becks&#x2014;mother, father, and three children aged twelve, nine, and three&#x2014;were moving back to the warmth of Pleasanton, California, after two years of hard winters in Marcus, Washington. John and Anna Gray, with their eighteen-month-old boy, Varden, were on their way home after an even more difficult trip. John had broken his leg and was all but immobile in a hip-to-ankle cast. Anna was distraught, in tears every night. &#x201c;We knew we were in a death trap,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;We were so much afraid that terrible week and could talk about nothing else.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In desperation, some of the passengers proposed escaping down the mountain on foot, but railroad officials wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it. &#x201c;To hike out,&#x201d; as one of them put it, &#x201c;is to take your life in your hands.&#x201d; A worker who made the attempt was soon tr...</p></p><h2>Murder, She Wrote: Gin and Daggers</h2><p><b>Jessica Fletcher</b> is off to London to deliver the keynote address at a mystery writers convention.

Yet people often get better. Why? How?&nbsp;<br><br>This book argues that the vast majority of healing comes from a few basic principles that can be used effectively by any system&#x2014;ancient or modern, conventional or alternative, proven or unproven&#x2014;and by both doctors and patients in their daily lives. The secret: to elicit a meaningful response in the person who requires healing.&nbsp;<br><br>My approach is based on almost forty years of seeing patients as a mainstream family doctor, as a trained scientist, and as an explorer of many medical systems. I discovered how healing happens through my work with patients, as director of the Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and as a research scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and Samueli Institute.&nbsp;<br><br>In this book, I&#x2019;m going to give you a simple, systematic approach to real healing. Drawing on the most rigorous scientific evidence available as well as wisdom from ancient healing traditions, I will show you that:&nbsp;<br><br>� Only 20% of healing comes from the &#x201c;treatment agent&#x201d; that the doctor applies to you&#x2014;whether that is surgery, drugs, acupuncture needles, herbs and supplements, diet, or anything else external to you.&nbsp;<br><br>� A full 80% of healing comes from constructing a meaningful treatment response, unique to you, which is internal and highly personal, using simple principles and components.&nbsp;<br><br>� You can activate your own inherent healing processes and get your physician and others on board to help accelerate your healing journey, making any approach more effective, safer, and less expensive. And these processes can prevent the majority of chronic diseases in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>I am not arguing, as some others do, that you can simply think yourself into healing. And I am well aware that understanding what stimulates healing or prevents disease will not fix a broken bone, cure cancer, or stop a heart attack. However, the top ten reasons for seeing a doctor, according to a study by the Mayo Clinic, include pain (especially back pain), fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, chronic heart or lung problems, or brain diseases such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s, Parkinson&#x2019;s, or depression. Almost all of these conditions accelerate and increase as we age, so even if you feel healthy now, chances are if you live long enough, you will get more than one of these conditions, unless you seek out ways to prevent them.&nbsp;<br><br>If you understand how healing really works for the most common chronic conditions, you can take greater control of your own recovery, increase the likelihood that any specific treatment will be effective, prevent many of the diseases of aging, and radically reduce your dependence on the medical industry. <i>How Healing Works </i>provides a way for merging curing and healing&#x2014;producing true integrative health.

The authors detail the changing rights of African Americans during the Civil War and the many legal acts that gave rights of citizenship to black people, such as the Emancipation Proclamation; the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution; and the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Also explained are the tides of white violence, racism, and changing political and economic landscapes that prevented or weakened protections. The narrative covers a lot of ground-and does so at occasionally breathtaking speed. The complexity of the subject and sophisticated language will be readable for high school students but is on the more challenging end of the spectrum. The writing is at times lyrical, with repeated phrases and beautifully constructed prose. Historical quotes, photographs, contemporaneous illustrations, and other primary sources that bring depth to the history are presented throughout.

In search of an answer, in the 1970s a Stanford psychologist named David Rosenhan and seven other people--sane, healthy, well-adjusted members of society--went undercover into asylums around America to test the legitimacy of psychiatry's labels. Forced to remain inside until they'd "proven" themselves sane, all eight emerged with alarming diagnoses and even more troubling stories of their treatment. Rosenhan's watershed study broke open the field of psychiatry, closing down institutions and changing mental health diagnosis forever. <br><br> But, as Cahalan's explosive new research shows in this real-life detective story, very little in this saga is exactly as it seems. What really happened behind those closed asylum doors?</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2019:</strong> Susannah Cahalan&#x2019;s first book <em>Brain on Fire</em> documented her experience with a treatable autoimmune disease that masqueraded as mental illness. The disease did so by causing inflammation on her brain, and after being misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, she was given antipsychotic drugs and nearly transferred to the psych ward. Luckily, an insightful doctor saved her from being committed to a very different life than the one she is living now. <p>Diseases like that are called the great pretenders, because their symptoms mimic the behaviors of psychiatric illnesses. Cahalan&#x2019;s personal experience led her deeper into the study of mental health, where she learned of a groundbreaking 1973 study called &#x201c;On Being Sane in Insane Places.&#x201d; In that study, a Stanford psychologist named David Rosenhan, along with seven other sane people, volunteered to get themselves committed into asylums by repeating the words &#x201c;thud, empty, hollow.&#x201d; That was pretty much all it took. Eventually, they had to find their way out. </p> <p><em>The Great Pretender</em> is a panoramic look at the mental health industry, but at its center is a mystery. As Cahalan, who is a journalist, sets out to learn more about Rosenhan&#x2019;s study, her work uncovers as many questions as it does answers. The result is a book that broadens our understanding of a system that many feel is broken, at the same time that it deepens our relationship to the people who are affected by that system (those who are admitted and those who are administering). It may also serve as a reminder that it&#x2019;s not always good for us to meet our heroes. The more we read about Rosenhan, the more we begin to wonder if he wasn't a different kind of pretender than people thought him to be.<em>--Chris Schluep, Amazon Book Review</em></p><b>Susannah Cahalan</b> is the award-winning, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Brain on Fire</i>: <i>My Month of Madness,</i> a memoir about her struggle with a rare autoimmune disease of the brain.

For the first time, <i>The Plot to Destroy Democracy</i> reveals the dramatic story of how blackmail, espionage, assassination, and psychological warfare were used by Vladimir Putin and his spy agencies to steal the 2016 U.S. election--and attempted to bring about the fall of NATO, the European Union, and western democracy. It will show how Russia and its fifth column allies tried to flip the cornerstones of democracy in order to re-engineer the world political order that has kept most of the world free since 1945. <br><br>Career U.S. Intelligence officer Malcolm Nance will examine how Russia has used cyber warfare, political propaganda, and manipulation of our perception of reality--and will do so again--to weaponize American news, traditional media, social media, and the workings of the internet to attack and break apart democratic institutions from within, and what we can expect to come should we fail to stop their next attack.<br><br>Nance has utilized top secret Russian-sourced political and hybrid warfare strategy documents to demonstrate the master plan to undermine American institutions that has been in effect from the Cold War to the present day. Based on original research and countless interviews with espionage experts, Nance examines how Putin's recent hacking accomplished a crucial first step for destabilizing the West for Russia, and why Putin is just the man to do it. <br><br>Nance exposes how Russia has supported the campaigns of right-wing extremists throughout both the U.S. and Europe to leverage an axis of autocracy, and how Putin's agencies have worked since 2010 to bring fringe candidate Donald Trump into elections.<br><br>Revelatory, insightful, and shocking, <i>The Plot To Destroy Democracy</i> puts a professional spy lens on Putin's plot and unravels it play-by-play. In the end, he provides a better understanding of why Putin's efforts are a serious threat to our national security and global alliances--in much more than one election--and a blistering indictment of Putin's puppet, President Donald J. Trump.<br></p><p><b>Malcolm Nance</b> is author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Plot to Hack America.</i> He is a globally recognized Intelligence community member and a counter-terrorism analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. <b><br></b><br><br>"Nance traces the revival of Russian enmity to Putin's second term as president, when he turned his KGB training to good use in weakening his American opponents by exploiting their divisions-exactly what those active measures are supposed to do... A convincing...cry that treason is afoot." <br>&#x2015;<b>Kirkus Reviews</b><br><br>"The early chapters are easy going; the writing gets denser as Russians pop up faster than creatures in a Whack-a-Mole game, but even as this plot gets more intricate (and, yes, sometimes it does read like a political thriller), readers will be turning pages quickly, feeling both anxiety and betrayal. When, in the final pages, Nance lays out how he believes Donald Trump was recruited by Russian intelligence through the time-tried operation known as MICE (money, ideology, coercion, and ego), even supporters of the president will have something to think about. For those who are not supporters, Nance offers suggestions designed to counter the threat." <br>&#x2015;<b>Booklist</b><br><br>"It's an admittedly serious discussion about a serious topic: the survival of our country.

In Dancing in the Glory of Monsters, renowned political activist and researcher Jason K. Stearns has written a compelling and deeply-reported narrative of how Congo became a failed state that collapsed into a war of retaliatory massacres. Stearns brilliantly describes the key perpetrators, many of whom he met personally, and highlights the nature of the political system that brought these people to power, as well as the moral decisions with which the war confronted them. Now updated with a new introduction, Dancing in the Glory of Monsters tells the full story of Africa's Great War.</p><p><b>Jason Stearns</b> is a CIC Senior Fellow and Director of the Congo Research Group.

Mr. Stearns has spoken to everyone-villagers, child soldiers, Mobutu's commanders, Kabila's ministers, Rwandan intelligence officers. In these conversations he found gold, bringing clarity-and humanity-to a place that usually seems inexplicable and barbaric. <i>Dancing in the Glory of Monsters</i> is riveting and certain to become essential reading for anyone looking to understand Central Africa."&#x2015;<b><i>Douglas Rogers, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></i></b><br><br>"The best account [of the conflict in the Congo] so far; more serious than several recent macho-war-correspondent travelogues, and more lucid and accessible than its nearest competitor. . . . [Stearns] has lived in the country, and has done a raft of interviews with people who witnessed what happened before he got there... his picture is clear, made painfully real by a series of close-up portraits." <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Adam Hochschild, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></i></b><br><br>"Enter Jason Stearns. One of Congo's most intrepid observers, he describes the war from the point of view of its perpetrators. He has tracked down and interviewed a rogue's gallery of them. The resulting book, <i>Dancing in the Glory of Monsters</i>, is a tour de force, though not for the squeamish." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Washington Post</i></i></b><br><br>"[Stearns] is probably the most widely traveled and the most meticulous and empathetic observer of the war there. This is a serious book about the social and political forces behind one of the most violent clashes of modern times-as well as a damn good read."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Economist</i></i></b><br><br>"A serious, admirably balanced account of the crisis and the political and social forces behind it, providing vivid portraits of both victims and perpetrators and eyewitness accounts of the main events... perhaps the most accessible, meticulously researched and comprehensive overview of the Congo crisis yet." <br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Financial Times</i></i></b><br><br>"[A] tremendous book. This is a very complicated, largely unfamiliar subject that's basically off the radar of the American media and he's managed to produce a genuinely readable and engrossing account.

But for anyone interested in the Congo and the Great Lakes region this is a great read-one I highly recommend."&#x2015;<b><i>Stephanie Wolters, <i>Mail &amp; Guardian</i> (Johannesburg)</i></b><br><br>"Perhaps the best account of the most recent conflict in the Congo."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Foreign Policy</i></i></b><br><br>"A brave and accessible take on the leviathan at the heart of so many of Africa's problems . . . Stearns's eye for detail, culled from countless interviews, brings this book alive . . . I once wrote that the Congo suffers from 'a lack of institutional memory,' meaning that its atrocities well so inexorably that nobody bothers to keep an account of them.

In <i>Meditation Secrets for Women</i>, they introduce a refreshingly modern, female-oriented approach to meditation that encourages "luxuriating in the sensory world, resting in the simplicity of your own being, enjoying yourself shamelessly."<p> Meditation fills a need that women crave: to carve out time for themselves "to rest, to restore, to settle in." Rather than impose rules and strict discipline, however, the authors encourage women to rejuvenate themselves, open up, and affirm their "womanness" through meditation.</p><p> <i>Meditation Secrets for Women</i> presents 12 "secrets" in 12 chapters. Each secret is a theme, such as "celebrate your senses," "claim your inner authority," "ride your rhythms," or "love your body."

This is a nurturing book, filled with acceptance, warmth, and encouragement.

A brilliant student delves&nbsp;&nbsp;dangerously into the dark side of the Force and&nbsp;&nbsp;unleashes the spirit of an ancient master of the evil&nbsp;&nbsp;order that warped Darth Vader himself. Working&nbsp;&nbsp;together, they may become an enemy greater than the&nbsp;&nbsp;New Republic has ever fought... more powerful than&nbsp;&nbsp;even a Jedi Master can face.</p><p><b>Kevin J. Anderson</b> has written many bestsellers and has been nominated for the&nbsp;Nebula Award, the&nbsp;Bram Stoker Award, and the&nbsp;<i>SFX</i> Reader&#x2019;s Choice Award. He also holds the Guinness World Record for largest single-author signing.1<br> &nbsp;<br> The huge orange sphere of the gas planet Yavin heaved itself over the horizon of its fourth moon. Soft, misty light shone across the ever-stirring jungles and the ancient stone temples.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke Skywalker used a Jedi refreshing technique to remove weariness from his body. He had slept soundly&#x2014;but the future of the New Republic and the fate of the galaxy weighed heavily upon him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke stood atop the squared pyramid of the Great Temple that had been abandoned millennia before by the lost Massassi race. During the Alliance&#x2019;s early struggles against the Empire, they had built a secret base in the ruins, from which they had launched their desperate attack against the first Death Star. Now, eleven years after the Rebels&#x2019; departure, Luke had returned to the fourth moon of Yavin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now he was a Jedi. A Jedi Master. He would be the first of a new generation, like those who had protected the Republic for a thousand generations. The old Jedi Knights had been respected and powerful, until Darth Vader and the Emperor had hunted and slaughtered virtually all of them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke had received support from Mon Mothma, the New Republic&#x2019;s Chief of State, to seek others who had a potential to use the Force&#x2014;trainees who might become part of a new order of Jedi. Luke had managed to bring a dozen students to his &#x201c;academy&#x201d; on Yavin 4, but he felt uncertain about the best way to train them.<br> &nbsp;<br> His own instruction by Obi-Wan and Yoda had been abbreviated, and Luke had since discovered facets of Jedi lore that made him realize just how much he still did not know. Even a great Jedi like Obi-Wan Kenobi had failed with his student and had let Anakin Skywalker become a monster named Darth Vader. Now Luke was expected to instruct others and make no mistakes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Do or do not, Yoda had said, there is no try.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke stood on the smooth, cool stones of the rooftop and looked out across the awakening jungle, smelling the myriad sharp and sweet scents as the air warmed in the morning light. The spicy tang of blueleaf shrub and the perfume of lush orchids drifted up to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke closed his eyes and let his hands hang at his side, his fingers spread. He let his mind open and relax; he drew strength from the Force, touching ripples made by the life-forms crowding the jungles below. With heightened senses he could hear the rustle of millions of leaves, twigs scraping, small animals scurrying through the underbrush.<br> &nbsp;<br> Letting out a yelp of pain and terror, a rodent thrashed and died as a predator crushed it in its jaws. Flying creatures sang mating songs to each other through the dense treetops. Large grazing mammals fed on leaves, tearing tender shoots from high branches or grubbing for fungi in the forest debris.<br> &nbsp;<br> A wide warm river, sapphire-blue overlaid with muddy swirls of brown, flowed past the Great Temple, barely visible under the thick trees. The river bifurcated to send a tributary past the old Rebel power-generating station, which Luke and Artoo-Detoo had repaired during their preparation for the Jedi academy. Where the river sloshed around a submerged, half-rotted tree, Luke could sense a large aquatic predator lurking in the shadows, waiting for smaller fishlike creatures to swim by.<br> &nbsp;<br> The plants grew. The animals flourished. The moon awakened to a new day. Yavin 4 was alive&#x2014;and Luke Skywalker felt energized.<br> &nbsp;<br> Listening intently, he heard two people approaching from far off in the dense foliage. They moved quietly, without speaking, but he could sense the change in the jungle as two of his Jedi candidates made a path through the undergrowth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke&#x2019;s introspective moment had ended. He smiled and decided to go down and meet them.<br> &nbsp;<br> As he turned to go back into the echoing stone halls of the temple, Luke looked up at the sky to see the streaking trails of a shuttlecraft descending through the humid atmosphere. He realized with a start that they were due for another delivery of supplies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke had been so focused on training new Jedi that he had lost touch with galactic politics. Upon seeing the shuttle, he felt a deep longing to know about Leia and Han and their children. He hoped the pilot would bring news.<br> &nbsp;<br> He shrugged down the hood of his brown Jedi cloak. The garment was too warm for the jungle humidity, but Luke had stopped noticing minor physical discomfort. He had walked across fire on Eol Sha and gone to the spice mines of Kessel, and he could not be bothered by a little perspiration.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the Rebels had first set up their hidden base in the Massassi temple, they had scoured the thick plant life from the chambers. Across the river stood another prominent temple, and according to orbital surveys, more structures lay buried under the implacable vegetation. But the Alliance had been far too wrapped up in its war against the Empire to bother with detailed archaeological inspections. The vanished race of temple builders remained as much a mystery now as when the Rebels had first set foot on Yavin 4.<br> &nbsp;<br> The temple&#x2019;s flagstoned corridors were uneven but remarkably unscathed after centuries of exposure to the elements. Luke took a turbolift from the pinnacle down to the third level, where other students slept or meditated in the early morning. As he stepped out of the turbolift, Artoo-Detoo puttered out to greet him. The droid&#x2019;s wheels hummed along the bumpy flagstones, and his hemispherical head rotated back and forth, chittering at Luke.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Artoo, I saw the shuttle coming down. Would you go down to the clearing to meet it for me? Gantoris and Streen are returning from their sojourn in the jungle. I want to greet them and learn what they&#x2019;ve found.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Artoo acknowledged with a bleep and trundled over to a stone ramp. Luke continued through the cool confines of the temple, smelling the mustiness of the enclosed air, the powdery tang of crumbling stones. Along the halls, some of the old Alliance banners still hung outside empty quarters.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke&#x2019;s Jedi academy was by no means luxurious; in fact, it was barely even comfortable. But he and his students had concerns that absorbed their energy far more than simple conveniences. Luke had not repaired all of the damage caused by time, but he had refurbished the glowpanels, water systems, and food-prep facilities the Alliance had installed.<br> &nbsp;<br> When he reached the ground level of the temple, the partially raised hangar-bay doors stood like the dark slit of a mouth. Luke sensed echoes of the past inside the hangar bay, a faint residue of starfighter fuel and coolant, clinging dust and grease in the corners. He stepped outside to the jungle, blinking in the washed-and-faded sunlight as evaporating mists rose from the damp undergrowth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke&#x2019;s timing was perfect. As he walked through the lush foliage, he heard his two Jedi trainees approach.<br> &nbsp;<br> As an exercise in resourcefulness and as an opportunity for uninterrupted concentration, Luke sent his students in pairs into the wilderness. Alone, with no other abilities but their own, they worked on powers of concentration, sensing and studying other life-forms, touching the Force.<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke raised his hand in greeting as the two stepped through feather ferns and thick blueleaf shrubs. Tall, dark Gantoris parted heavy branches and came forward to meet Luke. His high forehead had been shaven clean of eyebrows; his skin looked chapped and weathered. Though Gantoris had calmly lived among geysers and lava flows on Eol Sha, he seemed startled to see the Jedi Master; but he covered his reaction instantly.<br> &nbsp;<br> On his hellish world, Gantoris had used an innate talent with the Force to keep a small group of forgotten colonists alive. Gantoris had had nightmares of a terrible &#x201c;dark man&#x201d; who would tempt him with power and then destroy him. At first he had thought Luke was that man&#x2014;Luke, who appeared in his dark Jedi robe, striding through a geyser field to ask Gantoris to come to his academy. Gantoris had tested Luke by making him walk across lava and climb through geysers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind Gantoris came Streen, the second candidate Luke had found in his Jedi search. Streen had lived as a gas prospector in an abandoned floating city on the planet Bespin. Streen had been able to predict eruptions of valuable gases from deep within the cloud layers. Luke had tempted him with the ability to shut off the clamoring voices Streen heard in his head whenever he went to populated areas.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the trainees bowed, Luke clasped their hands. &#x201c;Welcome back. Tell me what you&#x2019;ve learned.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We found another Massassi temple!&#x201d; Streen said breathlessly, looking back and forth. His wispy pale hair was tangled, matted with flecks of vegetation.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Gantoris said. The man&#x2019;s ruddy face and his braided dark hair were smudged with sweat and dirt. &#x201c;The new temple isn&#x2019;t as large as this one, but it seems more potent somehow. It&#x2019;s made of obsidian, sitting out in the middle of a shallow glassy lake, with a tall statue of a great lord.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A site of great power!&#x201d; Streen said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I felt the power too,&#x201d; Gantoris added. He straightened, tossing his thick braid behind him. &#x201c;We should learn all we can about the Massassi race. They seem to have been very powerful, but they vanished entirely. What happened to them? Is there something we need to fear?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke nodded gravely. He, too, had sensed the power in the temples. The first time he had come to Yavin 4, Luke had been little more than a boy thrust headfirst into the Rebellion against the Empire. He had barely realized the extent of the Force; in fact, he had learned of its existence only days before.<br> &nbsp;<br> But he returned to the jungle moon a Jedi Master, and he could sense many things that had been hidden to him before. He knew the dark power that Gantoris had detected, and although he told his students they must share what they learned, Luke felt that certain knowledge could be deadly.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>My Bondage and My Freedom (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Ex-slave Frederick Douglass's second autobiography-written after ten years of reflection following his legal emancipation in 1846 and his break with his mentor William Lloyd Garrison-catapulted Douglass into the international spotlight as the foremost spokesman for American blacks, both freed and slave.

Before receiving my own copy of this book, I'd read reviews on Amazon.com which stated that the authors actually wrote this book for the zojirushi bread machine. This is not the case. In fact, this book has a lot of guidance for using any 1.5 to 2 pound bread machine for baking.Each recipe is written with a typical wheat setting in mind, but a gluten free setting is recommended. I have been using a Cuisinart bread machine with a gluten free setting for baking recipes from this book and I could not be more pleased with the results. You do not need to have the most expensive bread machine on the market in order to be successful making gluten free breads. Each recipe I've tried from this book (and I've tried most of them) has come out beautifully. My family's favorite gluten free breads are the Henk's<br> Flax Bread and the Cinnamon Raison Bread, which turns out better than any bakery loaf, bar none! We all refer lovingly to Henk's Flax Bread as "Uncle Henk's Bread", as we feel a true bond with this "Henk" and his wondrous bread. We used to purchase healthy grain breads from the grocery store each week. However, since receiving this cookbook back in February, we have not bought one single loaf of bread. I've been making ALL of our bread from scratch, using no other book than this one. Because of this, we've saved money, lost weight, and we're eating so much more nutritiously now. Honestly, if you plan on making gluten free breads in your bread machine, this is the book you need. Store-bought gluten free breads can be dry and tasteless, but the breads you'll make from recipes in this book will most definately amaze you. I give this book 5 spatulas! This is a must have book for anyone with a bread machine. I would recommend trying the cinnamon raison bread and henk's flax bread for anyone<br> who is using a bread machine and would like a healthy alternative to ordinary breads. These are sooooooooo good. (<i>Top Cook Books topcookbooks.com</i> 2011-05-12)</p><h2>Consciencism</h2><p>Near Fine; see scans and description. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970.

The stage is set for Qwilleran, Koko, Yum Yum, and the second act of murder most meow...</p><p>The history of <b>Lilian Jackson Braun</b> is perhaps as exciting and mysterious as her novels. Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.The cats behave with their usual preternatural insight and intelligence as Braun makes another entry in her bestselling series. Jim Qwilleran, with his Siamese cats, Koko and Yum Yum, is trying to make sense of his new life in the Moose County town of Pickax in rural Minnesota. Murder intervenes. Golden Voice George Guidall is clearly playing to his expected audience. His characterizations are sometimes prissy and often bitchy, all conveyed by tone of voice. Were one to understand no English except personal names, one would have no doubt discerning the villains and the heroes. This is a mannered mystery in the classic sense, and few could deliver it better than Guidall.

Her most cherished sights and experiences color this timeless, graceful portrait of a city that's as famous as it is alluring.</p></p><p>It becomes evident from the first page of <i>The Stones of Florence</i> that Mary McCarthy loves her subject. Yet hers is the steady love of a long acquaintance, an affection that has deepened from mere infatuation to a steady, clear-eyed regard. In this witty tribute to Florence, Mary McCarthy explores the city's past and present, in the process offering up a tour that covers everything from a description of oil painting to the remarkable history behind Florence's many towers. <i>The Stones of Florence</i> is ideal for reading on the plane ride to Italy, but it's also perfect for armchair travelers, art lovers, and students of the Renaissance.MARY MCCARTHY (1912&#x2013;1989) was a short-story writer, bestselling novelist, essayist, and critic.

Bradbury&#x2019;s <em>TheMartian Chronicles </em>is a must-read for any fan of science fiction orfantasy, a crucial precursor to films like <em>Avatar </em>and <em>Alien</em> andbooks like Kim Stanley Robinson&#x2019;s <em>Red Mars </em>and Dan Simmons&#x2019; <em>Hyperion</em>,and a haunting prophesy of humanity&#x2019;s destiny to bring our old dreams andfollies along with us wherever we may venture forth.</p><p>From "Rocket Summer" to "The Million-Year Picnic," Ray Bradbury's stories of the colonization of Mars form an eerie mesh of past and future. Written in the 1940s, the chronicles drip with nostalgic atmosphere--shady porches with tinkling pitchers of lemonade, grandfather clocks, chintz-covered sofas. But longing for this comfortable past proves dangerous in every way to Bradbury's characters--the golden-eyed Martians as well as the humans. Starting in the far-flung future of 1999, expedition after expedition leaves Earth to investigate Mars. The Martians guard their mysteries well, but they are decimated by the diseases that arrive with the rockets. Colonists appear, most with ideas no more lofty than starting a hot-dog stand, and with no respect for the culture they've displaced. <p> Bradbury's quiet exploration of a future that looks so much like the past is sprinkled with lighter material. In "The Silent Towns," the last man on Mars hears the phone ring and ends up on a comical blind date. But in most of these stories, Bradbury holds up a mirror to humanity that reflects a shameful treatment of "the other," yielding, time after time, a harvest of loneliness and isolation. Yet the collection ends with hope for renewal, as a colonist family turns away from the demise of the Earth towards a new future on Mars. Bradbury is a master fantasist and <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> are an unforgettable work of art. <i>--Blaise Selby</i></p>8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Great Plains</h2><p><p><b>National Bestseller</b></p><p>With his unique blend of intrepidity, tongue-in-cheek humor, and wide-eyed wonder, Ian Frazier takes us on a journey of more than 25,000 miles up and down and across the vast and myth-inspiring<i> Great Plains</i>.

By day, Parsons&#x2019; unorthodox genius created a solid rocket fuel that helped the Allies win World War II. By night, Parsons called himself The Antichrist. &#x201c;One of the best books of the year.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Anomalist</i></p></p><p>Scientist, poet, and self-proclaimed Antichrist, Jack Parsons was a bizarre genius whose life reads like an implausible yet irresistible science fiction novel. <i>Sex and Rockets</i> looks at his short life and dual career as cofounder of Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and leader of the Agape Lodge of Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Author John Carter scours primary documents and interviews surviving friends and contemporaries to deliver an intriguing portrait of a dreamy, driven man equally interested in rocketry and magick. From his early childhood and deep attachment to his mother (who killed herself hours after he died) through his nonacademic research and brilliant innovations in solid fuels to his mysterious 1952 demise in a garage-laboratory explosion at the age of 37, the reader gets the impression of a man whose obsession with explosives and propellants was nearly single-minded. Yet this same man found spiritual fulfillment through Crowley's Law of Thelema, conducted magickal operations with L. Ron Hubbard, and signed an oath asserting himself to be the Antichrist--clearly Parsons wasn't a boring guy in a white coat. Carter pulls off the difficult task of integrating Parsons's disparate drives into one compelling story; though there are some rough spots and awkward transitions, one gets the sense that this illuminates the man's life better than a smooth, flawless work would. Robert Anton Wilson's introduction is smart and funny as always, initiating the uninformed into the basics of Crowleyanity while placing Parsons in the context of his times. While it might not be possible to read universal themes into Parsons's life, <i>Sex and Rockets</i> is an excellent study of a passionate life fully lived. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><h2>Restoring All Things: God&#39;s Audacious Plan to Change the World through Everyday People</h2><p>It&#39;s easy to get discouraged by the headlines.

Here the story of Israel, scourged by judgment and exile and hopeful of restoration, is framed by its witnesses, heaven and earth. How will Israel be brought through its school of suffering and be propelled toward its divine destiny as the vanguard of a new heaven and earth? In the visionary world of Isaiah, the varied themes and imagery of the Old Testament converge and blend to transcend their plainest meanings as they project an extraordinary climax of the story of Israel and of the world. Barry Webb calls Isaiah the &#34;Romans&#34; of the Old Testament, where all the threads come together and the big picture of God&#39;s purposes for his people and for his world are most clearly set forth. Attuned to the magnificent literary architecture of Isaiah, Webb escorts us through this prophecy and trains our ears and hearts to resonate with its great biblical-theological themes.</p><p>Barry G.

So it should come as no surprise that I was involved with the Wiccan movements in the United States. We published some of the first books on Wicca in the U.S. and held some of the first Pagan festivals in this country. <br>Over the years I have received thousands of letters from people wanting to know how to become Witches. Many of them came from people who knew a little about the Craft and were specifically interested in Celtic Wicca. <br>If you are interested in this style of the Craft and want to know where to start, I can recommend <i>Celtic Magic</i> by D. J. Conway. Over 225,000 people have this book, and you should have it, too. <br>This book has everything you need to start learning the Celtic traditions.

We exaggerate our accomplishments on our r�sum� to get an interview. Temptation blindsides us. And we make snap decisions we regret.<br><br>Minor ethical lapses can seem harmless, but they instill in us a hard-to-break habit of distorted thinking. Rationalizations drown out our inner voice, and we make up the rules as we go. We lose control of our decisions, fall victim to the temptations and pressures of our situations, taint our characters, and sour business and personal relationships.<br><br>In Ethics for the Real World, Ronald Howard and Clinton Korver explain how to master the art of ethical decision making by:<br>Identifying potential compromises in your own life<br>Applying distinctions to clarify your ethical thinking<br>Committing in advance to ethical principles<br>Generating creative alternatives to resolve dilemmas<br><br>Packed with real-life examples, this book gives you practical advice to respond skillfully to life's inevitable ethical challenges.

Korver is the founder and CEO of DecisionStreet, which provides Web-based tools to help consumers make important life decisions.Few are likely to quibble that Thou shalt not illegally download copyrighted media files doesn't have quite the solemnity or clarity of Thou shalt not steal. Howard and Korver invite readers into ethics' gray areas and guide them in developing a personal ethical code hardy enough for the most ambiguous situations. The book presents a four-part plan to become aware of ethical temptation and compromise, the fundamentals of ethical logic and using ethics as an avenue to a happier life. The authors successfully tease out the prudential, legal and ethical dimensions of actions&#x2014;however, readers might become frustrated with the lack of conclusive instructions. Furthermore, while the putative goal of the book is to assist readers in constructing their personal code, the sample models presented are so rife with inconsistencies that the book contributes to more ethical confusion than clarity. While the very nature of ethics acknowledges the varying shades of gray, a bit more black and white when it comes to ethical guidance might lead to a more satisfying read. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It does not train young people to form a relationship but rather to form a series of relationships, hardening themselves to all but the current one. Recreational dating encourages emotional attachments without covenantal fences and makes a joke of a father's authority. The disrespect children have for their fathers in this area is an echo of the disrespect fathers have for their own office.<p></p><p>In this book, Douglas Wilson argues that biblical courtship provides a wonderful freedom. It involves familial wisdom and godly protection. Grounded upon the involved authority of the father, courtship delights in its public connection to the lives of families. Sexual purity is a great inheritance for a marriage, and part of a father's job is to guarantee and protect that heritage.</p><p></p><p>This book is a part of Douglas Wilson's series of books on the family, which has helped many people trying to deal with the on the ground messes that come with sinners trying to live under the same roof. This book on courtship does not offer so much a surefire method for good marriages as remind us that the wisdom of elders is to be heeded before getting into something as permanent as marriage.</p></p><p><b>Douglas Wilson</b> is a Senior Fellow of theology at New Saint Andrews College.

Over four hundred lives and twenty-one tons of California gold were lost. It was the worst peacetime disaster at sea in American history, a tragedy that remained lost in legend for over a century.<br><br>In the 1980s, a young engineer from Ohio set out to do what no one, not even the U.S. Navy, had been able to do: establish a working presence on the deep ocean floor and open it to science, archaeology, history, medicine, and recovery. The SS Central America became the target of his project. After years of intensive efforts, Tommy Thompson and the Columbus-America Discovery Group found the Central America in eight thousand feet of water, and in October 1989 they sailed into Norfolk with her recovered treasure: gold coins, bars, nuggets, and dust, plus steamer trunks filled with period clothes, newspapers, books, journals, and even an intact cigar sealed under water for 130 years. <i>Life</i> magazine called it the greatest treasure ever found.&#x201d;<br><br>Gary Kinder tells an extraordinary tale of history, human drama, heroic rescue, scientific ingenuity, and individual courage. <i>Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea</i> is a testament to the human will to triumph over adversity. It is also a great American adventure story of the opening of Earth&#x2019;s last frontier.</p><p>The facts speak for themselves. In 1857, the <i>Central America</i>, a sidewheel steamer ferrying passengers fresh from the gold rush of California to New York and laden with 21 tons of California gold, encountered a severe storm off the Carolina coast and sank, carrying more than 400 passengers and all her cargo down with her. She then sat for 132 years, 200 miles offshore and almost two miles below the ocean's surface--a depth at which she was assumed to be unrecoverable--until 1989, when a deep-water research vessel sailed into the harbor at Norfolk, Virginia, fat with salvaged gold coins and bullion estimated to be worth one billion dollars. <p> Author Gary Kinder wisely lets the story of the Columbus-America Discovery Group, led by maverick scientist and entrepreneur Tommy Thompson, unfold without hyperbole. Kinder interweaves the tale of the <i>Central America</i> and her passengers and crew with Thompson's own story of growing up landlocked in Ohio, an irrepressible tinkerer and explorer even in his childhood days, and his progress to adulthood as a young man who always had "7 to 14" projects on the table or spinning in his head at any given moment. One of those projects would become the preposterous recovery of the stricken steamer, and the resourcefulness and later urgency with which the project would proceed is contrasted poignantly with the <i>Central America</i>'s doomed battle in 1857 to stay afloat. </p><p> Thompson, who spent nearly a decade planning and organizing his recovery effort, emerges as one of the great unsung adventurers of these times (the technical innovations alone required for such a task produced a windfall for the scientific community and defined a new state of the art for deep-sea explorers and treasure hunters), and the story of the steamer's sinking is compelling enough to make any reader wonder why the <i>Central America</i> sinking isn't synonymous with <i>shipwreck</i> in this <i>Titanic</i>-happy age. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>"The truly fascinating tale of the first successful deep-water ocean salvage operation is a tribute to good, old-fashioned American ingenuity and grit - with a big does of Titanic-like adventure to book.<p>Kinder's well-told tale of the Central America recovery . . . is one of the great scientific adventure stories of our time."<br>--<i>Kirkus</i></p></p><h2>Answers Book for Kids Volume 2</h2><p><p>Dinosaurs are fascinating creatures that kids simply adore, and even the youngest believer can recite the biblical story of Noah and his ark.

Among significant mid-century interiors, none are more celebrated yet underpublished as the homes created by architects and interior designers for themselves. This collection of newly commissioned photographs presents the most compelling homes by influential mid-century designers, such as Russel Wright, George Nakashima, Harry Bertoia, Charles and Ray Eames, and Eva Zeisel, among others. Intimate as well as revelatory, Williamson&#x2019;s photographs show these creative homes as they were lived in by their designers: Walter Gropius&#x2019;s historic Bauhaus home in Massachusetts; Albert Frey&#x2019;s floating modernist aerie on a Palm Springs rock outcropping; Wharton Esherick&#x2019;s completely handmade Pennsylvania house, from the organic handcarved staircase to the iconic furniture.

Examining Europe&#39;s encounters with Jews, Muslims, Africans, Native Americans, Mongols, and the Romani (&#39;Gypsies&#39;), from the 12th through 15th centuries, she shows how racial thinking, racial law, racial practices, and racial phenomena existed in medieval Europe before a recognizable vocabulary of race emerged in the West. Analysing sources in a variety of media, including stories, maps, statuary, illustrations, architectural features, history, saints&#39; lives, religious commentary, laws, political and social institutions, and literature, she argues that religion - so much in play again today - enabled the positing of fundamental differences among humans that created strategic essentialisms to mark off human groups and populations for racialized treatment. Her ground-breaking study also shows how race figured in the emergence of homo europaeus and the identity of Western Europe in this time.</p><p>This book is for readers who may or may not be familiar with the Middle Ages, but are interested in race and racism, and want to know how far back in time racism begins to appear. The book does for race studies what feminism, queer studies, postcolonial studies, have done to change how we view the past.Geraldine Heng is Perceval Fellow and Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Texas, Austin. She is the author of Empire of Magic: Medieval Romance and the Politics of Cultural Fantasy (2012), and England and the Jews: How Religion and Violence Created the First Racial State in the West (Cambridge, 2018).&nbsp;Originally from Singapore, Heng has held the Winton Chair (for 'paradigm-shifting scholarship') at the University of Minnesota.

Sailing the frozen seas round-trip from Australia to Mawson Station in the South Pole, Sophie recounts the adventure of a lifetime in her own words, illustrations, and color photographs. She&#x2019;ll show us icebergs, penguins, seals, and whales! It&#x2019;s a dangerous journey, but Sophie is well prepared for the thrills and chills that await her on top of the world. <p>This friendly, informative, and beautifully presented picture book is based on the author&#x2019;s own experiences and shows the wonder of Antarctica through a child&#x2019;s eyes. </p></p><p>Australian author Alison Lester is perhaps best known for her picture books. However, she captivated her audience with her first novel, <i>The Quicksand Pony</i>. In a starred review, School Library Journal called it &#x201c;a gripping adventure story, a tale of survival, an engaging mystery, a touching animal story, and a family saga.&#x201d;K-Gr 4-In this stimulating, well-integrated mixture of text and images, a fictional nine-year-old accompanies her dad, the captain of the Aurora Australis, as he delivers people and supplies to Mawson Station in Antarctica. Lester based the book on her own six-week excursion on the vessel. She combines sketches and paintings of Sophie-peeking out from her curtained berth or finding her way back to the station in a blizzard using rope-with rubber stamps, photographs, and art by children, received in response to emails she sent during her journey. Sophie's journal entries make up the text. There is great child appeal in the images, harsh conditions, and survival strategies, as well as in the behavior of animals. Diagrams depict ship parts and how icebergs are made; captioned postage stamps describe the fates of four early explorers. Occasional sequential photographs, sometimes grouped as 20 to 25 rectangles to a page, reveal the multiple moods of icebergs and sunsets and convey the sense that this adventure really happened. Endpapers contain geographical and historical tidbits and maps, first with a traditional view, where Antarctica is the southern-most point, and then an aerial view. This subject matter is similar to Sophie Webb's My Season With Penguins (Houghton Harcourt, 2000) and Jennifer Owings Dewey's Antarctic Journal (HarperCollins, 2001), though both of those volumes are rather dense for the picture-book format.-Wendy Lukehart, District of Columbia Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

In the 1950s two movements- evangelicalism and ecumenism- offered differing paths to unity in the church. But as the decades have passed the influence of ecumenism has exposed a fault line in evangelicalism. Questions of critical importance have been brought to the surface: Is the gospel broader than evangelicals have historically insisted? Can there be unity with non-evangelicals in evangelism and church leadership? Does the gospel have priority over denominational loyalty? These gained high profile in the crusades led by Dr. Billy Graham on both sides of the Atlantic, and in the subsequent interaction among evangelicals in North America and Europe. At first a new policy of 'co-operation without compromise' promised an 'evangelical renaissance'. Those who feared an inevitable devalutation of the gospel were viewed as destined for the kind of isolation to which fundamentalism had been consigned earlier in the century. Evangelicalism Divided traces the fascinating saga of the personalities, institutions and publications involved in this fifty-year period. Iain Murray's account is not simply a black and white narrative. But using the mass of sources now available he shows how the new policy ivolved concessions which seriously weakened biblical Christianity. The first and greatest need, he argues, is to answer the most fundamental and divisive question of all: What is a Christian? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>Iain Murray's historical overview of the fortunes and misfortunes of evangelical Christianity, especially in England, between 1950 and the century's end-time, will stir up both an approving and a dissenting readership. But no one can contend that it ignores some of the most vital theological issues of the time and the conflicts surrounding them. The narrative is well documented, and it details not only conflicts of perspective but inconsistencies and alterations of views by some of the leading participants in the events of the day. The names best known to Americans - Billy Graham, Martyn Lloyd-Jones, James Packer, John Stott among them - are evaluated, commended and critiqued as contributory to the present-day evangelical outlook and predicament.<br>Carl F.H. Henry</p><p>Iain H. Murray, born in Lancashire, England, in 1931, was educated in the Isle of Man and at the University of Durham and entered the Christian ministry in 1955. He served as assistant to Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones at Westminster Chapel (1956-59) and subsequently at Grove Chapel, London (1961-69) and St. Giles Presbyterian Church, Sydney (1981-84). Although remaining a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, he currently lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, where the Banner of Truth Trust (of which he is a founding trustee) has its main office.</p><h2>Taking Up The Runes: A Complete Guide To Using Runes In Spells, Rituals, Divination, And Magic</h2><p>Although many of us first encountered runes in J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s Lord of the Rings, this sacred alphabet is by no means a fabrication for books or movies. Similar to Hebrew letters in the sense that each symbol contains a meaning that transcends its original function as a letter, the runes are practical, flexible, and effective symbols with a variety of uses. Today, the best known application of rune lore is divination: chips or stones marked with runes are drawn, cast, or laid out in patterns like tarot cards. In Taking Up the Runes, Paxson delves into the ancient historical meaning of each rune and explains their contemporary uses and meanings. We discover that the real power of runes comes from inside ourselves when we find the wisdom and power within each symbol and internalize them.</p><p>Diana Paxson is author of more than a dozen historical novels with strong spiritual themes including The White Raven and The Serpent&#39;s Tooth. She is also the coauthor, with Marion Zimmer Bradley, of Priestess of Avalon and has continued the immensely popular Mists of Avalon series on her own.</p><h2>Saint Thomas Aquinas: The Story of the the Dumb Ox (Saints Lives)</h2><p>Shows how St. Thomas was big, quiet and slow to speak, thus being called the \&#34;Dumb Ox\&#34; by fellow students.

Paul, Dickens tells us, knew, but the average reader of today is not always likely to be so knowledgeable.<br><br>In the 1800s, British money was calculated in units of pounds, shillings, and pence. These were the units of <i>value</i> -- like the American mill, cent, and dollar -- in which all transactions were reckoned, regardless of whether the value was represented by a bookkeeping entry, by coin, by bank notes, or by notations written on a check. The actual <i>physical</i> instruments of currency were paper bank notes and gold, silver, copper, and bronze coins like the sixpence, the crown, the sovereign, the shilling piece, and the penny. Thus, for example, the physical units called pennies were used to measure the value created by an equivalent number of pence. (The guinea, uniquely, was a unit of physical currency that <i>also</i> became an abstract measure of value as well; that is, long after the actual guinea coin itself stopped being minted in the early 1800s, prices for luxury items like good horses and expensive clothes continued to be quoted in guineas as if it were some independent unit of value like the pound.)<br><br>Sovereigns and half sovereigns were gold; crowns, half crowns, florins, shillings, sixpences, and threepences were silver; pence, ha'pence, and farthings were copper until 1860, after which they were bronze. The coins were issued by the Royal Mint, but the bank notes got their names from the fact that they were not issued by a government agency but by a bank, in fact -- after the mid-1800s -- only by <i>the</i> bank -- the Bank of England. Until then banks all over the country issued their own bank notes (or promises to pay), which circulated more or less like money. Private banks in the provinces are by one estimate believed to have cranked out about �20,000,000 worth of notes between 1810 and 1815. With the Bank Charter Act of 1844, however, the government gave the Bank of England a monopoly on the issuance of bank notes. As the currency of other banks subsequently disappeared from circulation, "bank note" or "note" in consequence became synonymous with the paper issued by the Bank of England.<br><br>To abbreviate their money, Britons used the symbol � for pound, <i>s.</i> for shilling, and <i>d.</i> for pence, although five pounds, ten shillings, sixpence could be written �5.10.6. "Five and six" meant five shillings and sixpence, and it would have been written "5/6."<br><br>It is very difficult to know what a pound or shilling from 1800 to 1859 is worth in 1990s America, and, as any economist will volubly inform you, the fact that the Victorians had no Hondas and we have no candles, i.e., we don't buy the same goods and don't have the same economic needs, makes the purchasing power of the two currencies fundamentally incommensurable. Nonetheless, intrepid estimates in the last ten years have put the pound's worth in the neighborhood of $20, $50 or $200.<br><br><b>The Calendar</b><br><br>London.

The word <i>term</i> designated alike the academic sessions of Oxford and Cambridge and the periods during which the high courts (King's Bench, Exchequer, and Common Pleas) sat; <i>vacation</i> the time when they were not in session. The academic terms appear to have lacked fixed dates from year to year, and Cambridge, as the calendar indicates, had one less term than Oxford. Beginning in 1831, the law terms were fixed at January 11-31 for Hilary Term, April 15-May 8 for Easter, May 22-June 12 for Trinity, and November 2-25 for Michaelmas. The law terms were abolished in favor of sessions in 1873.<br><br>2. In 1752 the British joined the rest of Europe by switching from the Julian (thereafter called Old Style) to the Gregorian calendar. This meant going from Wednesday, September 2, 1752, directly to Thursday, September 14, 1752, and dropping eleven days permanently. In <i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles,</i> we are thus told that "Lady Day was at hand, and would soon be followed by Old Lady Day, the end of her term here," the incidence of the same quarter day being calculated differently under the two systems of figuring.<br><br>3. Quarter days marked off three-month periods of the year on which rents were traditionally due, servants might be hired to begin a term of labor, and so on, as the passage above from Tess indicates. Dickens in <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> describes the renters in Southwark as "migratory, usually disappearing the verge of quarter-day."<br><br>4. Since there are occasional, sometimes rather knowing, references to the reigning monarch in some of the novels, it may be helpful to be reminded of the dates of their reigns.<br><br>George III 1760-1820<br><br>George IV 1820-30<br><br>William IV 1830-37<br><br>Victoria 1837-1901<br><br>For the last ten years of his life George III was insane. His son, later George IV, was declared prince regent during this period, which was accordingly known as the Regency era.<br><br><b>HOGSHEADS AND DRAMS: ENGLISH MEASUREMENT</b><br><br>Until 1826 Britain stumbled along with a variety of quaint Anglo-Saxon measurement systems like the quartern, the hogshead, or the furlong that were harder and harder to use as industry and commerce grew more modern and widespread. Accordingly, Parliament drew itself up and promulgated the Imperial Statute System of Weights and Measures. The Imperial system of measurement left basically unchanged the units for measuring weight and distance but altered others, resulting in a queer patchwork of modern and archaic means of measurement. Like the corresponding American measurements, the English foot was twelve inches, and the mile, 5,280 feet. There were some additional units of measurement specific to England, however. Thus, in between the foot and the mile came the furlong, equal to 660 feet. (It was the old measure of a standard plowed field's length, i.e., one "furrow long".) The pound was an equivalent unit of weight in both England and the United States, too. However, the British both before and after 1826 also used the stone (fourteen pounds) as a unit of weight. Eight stone in turn constituted a hundredweight (abbreviated cwt). (In <i>The Return of the Native</i> Susan Nunsuch uses wax from the hundredweight of honey she has to make a doll of Eustacia Vye into which to stick pins.)<br><br>The reform of 1826 introduced the quarter, which weighed 28 pounds -- one quarter of a hundredweight. (Not to be confused with a quartern -- "quartern" with an "n" on the end being a more general term referring to a quarter measurement of an ounce, a stone, a peck, or a pint. A quartern loaf was a sort of standard bread size equal to a four-pound loaf.) More significantly, the Imperial system standardized the measurement of volume for both liquid and dry goods. 8.655 cubic inches constituted a gill, of which four made a pint. As in the United States, there were two pints to a quart and four quarts to a gallon (except that the English gallon was somewhat larger than that of the United States) and then came pecks, bushels, and so on. (288 gallons = 144 pecks = 36 bushels = 4.5 quarters.)<br><br>Notwithstanding the advent of the new system, many goods continued to be measured in their own peculiar units even after 1826. Cloth, for example, was often measured in ells, each 1 1/4 yards long. Port and madeira wines were measured in pipes (about 100 gallons a pipe) and other wines were measured in hogsheads, as was ale, the hogshead being the equivalent of 1 1/2 barrels or 54 gallons. The practice of measuring wine by butts and tuns seems to have faded by the century's end.<br><br>A minor note: the dram was a unit of weight equivalent to one-sixteenth of an ounce. When, however, Abel Magwitch confesses to the soldiers who catch him on the marshes in <i>Great Expectations</i> that he stole "some broken wittles -- that's what it was -- and a dram of liquor, and a pie," he is referring not to this minuscule portion but to the amount of liquor one can down in one swallow.<br><br><b>ENGLAND</b><br><br>England and Wales were divided into fifty-two counties, units of both governmental and residential significance to the average English person. Many of the counties had names ending in " -- shire"; the counties were <i>called</i> shires until William the Conqueror changed the name of the old regional designation. Much of Jane Austen's novels was set in the counties not far north and south of London. George Eliot's novels are often set in the Midlands, the area of fox hunting and enclosures north of London. Dickens, of course, centered most of his books in London itself; often, however, their locale may wander, as in <i>Pickwick, Great Expectations,</i> and <i>David Copperfield,</i> southeast of London to the coastal region of Rochester and Chatham, where Dickens spent part of his childhood. A good portion of <i>Vanity Fair</i> is set in and around "Queen's Crawley, Hants.," the latter being an abbreviation for Hampshire county, not far southwest of London.<br><br>In the far north, there was Yorkshire, where a good part of the second half of <i>Jane Eyre</i> takes place. <i>Wuthering Heights,</i> of course, is set in western Yorkshire in the area of the county known as the "west riding." And lastly, there was the Wessex of the great Hardy novels, a region in the southwest of England whose name the novelist borrowed from the old Saxon kingdom that had once occupied the area, territory Hardy described as "bounded on the north by the Thames, on the south by the English Channel, on the east by a line running from Hayling Island to Windsor Forest, and on the west by the Cornish coast," of which Dorset was the heart.<br><br>The names of certain cities would also have conjured up vivid associations for the nineteenth-century Englishman. Industry, of course, was centered in the north. Thus, Birmingham (sometimes "Brummagem") was the center of metal manufacturing; Manchester of the cotton industry; Newcastle, of course, supplied coal to the country; and Bath was a social center that developed to meet the needs of rich, gouty invalids who came there to take the waters. Liverpool, where Mr. Earnshaw finds and takes pity on the boy Heathcliff, "starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the streets," was the main port of connection in northern England with the Atlantic and the West Indies. Portsmouth, on the southern coast and important in <i>Mansfield Park,</i> was a major naval base.<br><br>And then there was London....<br><br><b>LONDON</b><br><br>London geography was determined by the Thames. The great river ran from west to east through the city after a dogleg north past Westminster -- so, too, did the city itself, its two great thoroughfares being the Strand-Fleet Street and Oxford Street-Holborn-Cheapside.<br><br>At its core was the old City of London -- known as "the City" as the century wore on -- an entity consisting of the roughly square mile making up the area that had once been inside the old walls of the medieval city of London, bounded by the Thames on the south, the Inns of Court and Temple Bar on the west, and the Tower in the east, with its seven gates (Newgate of prison fame being one), which had all been torn down save for "that leaden-headed old obstruction," as Dickens calls it at the beginning of <i>Bleak House,</i> "appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed corporation, Temple Bar."<br><br>Within the City. lay the Royal Exchange (the 'Change upon which Scrooge's word in <i>A Christmas Carol</i> is said to be so good), which was a gathering place for merchants in different trades, and the Bank of England, the financial nucleus of the nation, together with the financial offices and activities that naturally clustered around them. In fact, the term "the City" was also used to denote the financial heart of England in the was that "Wall Street" is used to describe the financial heart of the United States. In Jane Austen's day, it was still customary for some merchants to live in the City, but as railroads were thrust through it and commuting became more feasible, even poor clerks began commuting to work from fringe or suburban areas the way we are told that Bob Cratchit does from Camdentown. In the first eighty, years of the nineteenth century, in fact, the resident population in the City dropped from 128,000 to 50,000, while greater London as a whole mushroomed from a million to more than 4.5 million people.<br><br>The fancy area of London was the West End, which lay west of Temple Bar and London's center, Charing Cross. (Bloomsbury, site of the Russell Square where the Sedleys live in <i>Vanity Fair,</i> became increasingly less fashionable after the 1820s.) At the historic core of the West End lay what had once been the royal city of Westminster, with its palaces of St. James and Whitehall, along with Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. The Treasury building was here, along with Downing Street, the Foreign Office and the Horse Guards (army headquarters). These had now become part of the larger, expanded London, and adjacent to this nerve center of government and royalty, the ultrafashionable West End residential area of Mayfair (and, later, Belgrave Square and the nonfashionable Chelsea farther south) grew up. Mayfair was the location of the posh men's clubs on Pall Mall, the exclusive shops on Bond Street and the fancy houses on the ritziest residential street in the city, Park Lane, overlooking the great greensward of Hyde Park on Mayfair's western border. All were within a short distance of the new royal residence, Buckingham Palace.<br><br>Predictably, the rest of the city became less fashionable and to the east, in particular, degenerated into slums, the East End along the docks beyond the area of the Tower becoming synonymous by the end of the century with poverty, and misery. There were other areas as desperately poor, however; the notorious St. Giles and Seven Dials that sheltered Fagin's gang were located not far from Charing Cross. Across the Thames lay Southwark, sometimes referred to as "the Borough" but part of London, where Little Dorrit's father was imprisoned in the Ma...</p><h2>Read-Aloud Book of Bible Stories</h2><p>From the scores of beautiful and thrilling tales in the Bible, celebrated British author Amy Steedman has collected three dozen that are sure to delight young children. <p> With the confidence of a master storyteller practiced in holding the attention of even the most restless child, she weaves tales of Noah and Moses, Solomon and David, and Daniel in the lion's den.

This anniversary edition features an updated package and a new Introduction by Feinstein.<br><br>Twenty-five years after it spent sixteen weeks atop the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list, <i>A Season on the Brink </i>remains the most celebrated basketball book ever written. Granted unprecedented access to legendary coach Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers during the 1985&#x2013;86 season, John Feinstein saw and heard it all&#x2014;practices, team meetings, strategy sessions, and midgame huddles&#x2014;as the team worked to return to championship form. The result is an unforgettable chronicle that not only captures the drama and pressure of big-time college basketball but also paints a vivid portrait of a complex, brilliant coach as he walks the fine line between genius and madness.</p><p>Why is <i>A Season on the Brink</i> the bestselling sports book of all time? The answer is easy: Bobby Knight. Audaciously brilliant, exasperatingly volatile, and <i>never</i> boring, the Indiana University basketball coach is Greek drama and comedy neatly wrapped in a red sweater. Like all high-strung people, Knight is particularly interesting when things don't go according to his playbook. John Feinstein had the good fortune to follow Knight and his Hoosiers through a difficult 1985-86 campaign; that Feinstein could watch that season attached to Knight's hip gives <i>A Season on the Brink</i> its sights and its sounds.

We learn about him through the letters he writes to someone of an undisclosed name, age and gender.</p><p>What is most notable about this funny, touching, memorable first novel from Stephen Chbosky is the resounding accuracy with which the author captures the voice of a boy teetering on the brink of adulthood. Charlie is a freshman. And while's he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. He's a wallflower--shy and introspective, and intelligent beyond his years, if not very savvy in the social arts. We learn about Charlie through the letters he writes to someone of undisclosed name, age, and gender, a stylistic technique that adds to the heart-wrenching earnestness saturating this teen's story. Charlie encounters the same struggles that many kids face in high school--how to make friends, the intensity of a crush, family tensions, a first relationship, exploring sexuality, experimenting with drugs--but he must also deal with his best friend's recent suicide. Charlie's letters take on the intimate feel of a journal as he shares his day-to-day thoughts and feelings: <p> </p><blockquote> I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why. </blockquote> With the help of a teacher who recognizes his wisdom and intuition, and his two friends, seniors Samantha and Patrick, Charlie mostly manages to avoid the depression he feels creeping up like kudzu. When it all becomes too much, after a shocking realization about his beloved late Aunt Helen, Charlie retreats from reality for awhile. But he makes it back in due time, ready to face his sophomore year and all that it may bring. Charlie, sincerely searching for that feeling of "being infinite," is a kindred spirit to the generation that's been slapped with the label X. <i>--Brangien Davis</i>Stephen Chbosky grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the University of Southern California&#39;s Filmic Writing Program.

She lives in Sierra Madre, California.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>The Ancient and Modern Mystery</b><br><br>In my twenty years as a healer and teacher, the one question I can count on every new student to ask is "What's a aura?" From antiquity there has been a myriad of literary and pictorial descriptions of the aura. Sometimes it has been depicted as a luminous radiation surrounding the body. Frequently, it has been pictured as a kind of light around the head -- which some religious traditions call a halo. Most of us are familiar with paintings of haloed Christian saints. In earlier Chinese and Japanese art, a single and sometimes a triple halo surrounds the head of images of the bodhisattva or Buddha. In ancient Egyptian culture, the aura was often depicted as wings enfolding the body. In Native American tradition, the radiant aura of the buffalo has given rise to the legend of the white buffalo. When Matthew (17:2) describes the transfiguration of Christ, he says that Jesus's face "did shine as the sun," and "his raiment was white as the light." Luke (9:29)adds that Jesus's raiment was "glistering." This is a Biblical description of Christ's aura, which the Apostles Peter, James, and John were able to see when they were taken by their Master to a mountain just prior to his crucifixion.<br><br>People who are able to see auras have often reported seeing a kind of luminous radiation surrounding an individual, usually consisting of one or sometimes several colors. We now know that the aura, or auric field, relates to the electromagnetic field, which emanates from all matter. This field of energy, which usually extends five or six inches around the body, is outside the range of normal vision and in what is sometimes termed the realm of psychic sight. But even those who can't see the aura can still have an experience of it. The aura is what keeps us from bumping our shopping carts into one another in the supermarket. It's what allows us to sense another's presence in a darkened room, and it's what makes someone turn to look at us across a crowded room.<br><br>This implies that the aura is not just a reflection of light, as might have been assumed from the literary descriptions and paintings of old. It is an emanation, a luminous radiation, a field of light or energy that extends beyond the body to interact with our external environment. It is an energy system that keeps body and mind alive and healthy, and may in actuality create them.<br><br>The aura itself is generated by the spinning of smaller vortices of energy located within the body. Different religious traditions have called these subtle energy centers different things, but the word most commonly used is <i>chakra</i> from the Sanskrit word meaning "wheel of light." These seven chakras are who and what we are, what we feel and how we think and change. They are how we express ourselves and how we create. Although we as Westerners have no cognitive awareness of its energies, the chakra system is precisely the means by which we gain awareness. It is how we experience life, how we perceive reality, and how we relate to self, others, and the world, It is life itself.<br><br>As we explore the aura and the chakras, it is important for us to view our journey not as revolutionary, but rather as very traditional. Chakras, as well as auras and electromagnetic fields, are as old as the earth itself. The chakra system, in fact, is a part of the ancient and lost mysteries. And, in the end, the chakra system in our bodies is how we find our way back to the most ancient mystery of all -- God, the Oneness, the Omniscient.<br><br>The majority of what I know about the chakra system has come directly from my twenty years of experience as a healer and aura reader. As a young healer and psychic, when I would look at another's auric field, I would notice that some areas were darker than others, or that there were "holes" in the aura. I came to understand that those holes were indications of ill health or predictive of illness to come. When I put "energy" into a body and watched its movement, I observed that adding energy to one part of the body reveals how the body uses energy, and therefore how healthy it is. I watched people think, I watched them feel. I saw that these "patterns" correspond to their disease. From this experience I learned that we can suppress information in the body or in the chakra system, but we can never eliminate it. We can alter that information by the way we move or the way we think. Even if we make a slight change in behavior, it precipitates change in every other aspect of our lives. That was when I began to view the aura as a reflection of a person's entire well-being.<br><br>I had grown up seeing auras. Though some people consider psychic or "second" sight a spiritual gift, psychism runs in my family and was never considered a "gift." It was a "knowing" that allowed family members to assist one another in times of imminent disaster.<br><br>I was raised by my grandmother and great-grandmother, Nana. It was Nana who taught me to see auras around plants, although she never used that term. She would say, "Do you see the light? What color is it? Do you see that the light on the plant is increasing?" She told me that cuttings taken from a plant on which light was increasing would take root, but that cuttings taken from a plant on which light was decreasing wouldn't root. Then she'd have me do experiments in which I'd take cuttings from different plants, some with a full bright aura, others with a diminishing auric field, so I could discover for myself the truth of her teachings. So it was that in a very practical way I learned from Nana to "see" auric light and energy and to identify what was "full of light" as that which was also "full of life."<br><br>When I was six, Nana's husband, Mickey, died. But she continued to have communication with him. Nana's ability to see the light around plants had been viewed by the less psychic family members as a benign idiosyncrasy. But as Nana began to share with the rest of the family more and more of what Mickey was "saying," they became alarmed. Her conversations with the dead came to be viewed as an indication of increasing mental instability. Fearing my great-grandmother was having a nervous breakdown, the family had her hospitalized, and Nana was given electroshock treatments. When she returned home, she no longer conversed with Mickey -- nor did she take me into the garden anymore to see the plants. Witnessing what had happened to Nana, I decided that if I was to avoid her experience I had better forget about seeing any more light around plants. And, at the age of seven, I did.<br><br>Then, in my early twenties, I married and had children, who began to speak about the "colored fuzz" around people. Their ability to "see" auras restimulated my own. In order to raise them responsibly, I was forced to seek out the teachers who could help me make sense of our experiences. My studies not only helped me make sense of those experiences but introduced me to their practical applications. I was taught rudimentary healing techniques, which I sometimes practiced on my friends. I had no intention of becoming a healer, but, as the people I "treated" began to feel better and talk about it, I found that that's what I had become.<br><br>When people came to me, I would explain what an aura was and how I saw their disease, and so I developed a reputation as an aura reader, too. One day a woman phoned, identifying herself as a healer. She asked if she could bring a client to my home and requested me to tell her what I saw in the aura of the client as she worked. I was completely unprepared for what transpired that day. Rather than laying-on-of-hands, which was the healing method I had been taught, Emilie Conrad D�oud used chanting and dancing in a very involved process. At the end of that process I told her what I had seen aurically. She then took that information to Dr. Valerie Hunt, who was at that time the Chairman of the Department of Kinesiology at UCLA. Dr. Hunt was researching the same process that we were, but from the viewpoint of a kinesiologist. Eventually I was asked to work in collaboration with both of them.<br><br>Dr. Hunt had received a grant to study Structural Integration, or rolfing (a technique for reshaping and realigning the body through deep manipulation). During the course of this project (which I will refer to throughout the book as The Rolf Study), we were able to measure the frequencies of the human energy field and discovered that these frequencies correlated with the frequencies of visible light. From that, we concluded that what science had been calling the human energy field, or the mind field, and what religious traditions had been calling the auric field were one and the same. Furthermore, the results of our research provided evidence that this large electromagnetic energy field is in fact generated by the smaller internal vortices of energy I mentioned earlier -- the chakras, the source of the human aura.<br><br>Around that same time, other scientists too were coming to the conclusion that the mind is not in the brain, but that it is an energy field in and around the body. New techniques such as Kirlian photography and biofeedback also pointed to the possibility of such a relationship. Wilder Penfield's <i>The Mystery of the Mind,</i> Karl Pribram's <i>Languages of the Brain,</i> Dr. Robert O. Becker's <i>The Body Electric,</i> W. A. Tiller's work, and the auric field research of Dr. Hunt all shed light on the connection between chakras, auras, and the mind. Similar, and in some cases more thorough, research had been in progress in the Soviet Union since the 1920s.<br><br>Our research at UCLA was significant on more than one level. It was perhaps the first attempt made in our country to examine an electrical manifestation, a magnetic field phenomenon, as connected to the healing process. Prior to that time, laying-on-of-hands healing had been viewed as a psychological, not an energetic process. Our research was important in that it was a meaningful attempt to correlate the body's natural frequency ranges with the spiritual world.<br><br>As a result of being involved with this research, I realized that in reading the aura I was looking at an aspect of mind, not in the intellectual sense but in terms of a definition that embraces all of consciousness -- the physical, the emotional, and the spiritual, as well as the intellectual. If the aura is an indication of a person's entire well-being, then the overall health of an individual is influenced by the way in which he or she lives his or her life. Thus, physical exercise, diet, meditation, and other spiritual practices, what and how we think as well as what we feel or don't feel, are all influential factors in determining how healthy -- or ill -- we are.<br><br>Health is generally defined as the absence of disease, but this is really an unsatisfactory definition. The word "health" means "wholeness." Health implies much more than freedom from disease. A complete definition of health must include vitality, appropriate feelings, clear thinking and reasoning, and a willingness to embrace change. Responsibility and creative self-expression, intuitive understanding and a vital spiritual life are also essential if we are to be whole and healthy. In his sermon on the mount, Jesus tells the multitude "Ye are the light of the world" (Matthew 5:14)and challenges them to let their light shine before men (Matthew 5:16). The light that shines forth from each of us -- the kind and quality of light generated by the chakras and reflected in the colors of our auric fields -- is a reflection of our state of health and our condition of wholeness. Thus, I came to understand that our definition of health needs to become "full of light."<br><br>Not long after my involvement with The Roll Study, I had an opportunity to put those research findings into practice and to learn even more, this time from the Native American culture, when I was asked to heal one of the Hopi tribal elders, Grandfather David Monongya. He was in Los Angeles to raise consciousness regarding the strip mining at Big Mountain, site of one of the first conflicts over the Hopi-Navajo tribal land. Grandfather David had cataracts. I laid hands on his body and very quickly moved to his head and laid hands on his eyes. He seemed to know exactly what I was doing. About the time I was actually beginning to accomplish something that I felt was healing, he said, "Oh, I see much better now. Please sit down." Of course I had not healed him, and in a manner of speaking, as it turned out, I ended up receiving a healing from him. He called to two or three other people in the house, and we listened for five hours as he related the Hopi prophecy. (See Appendix II for a summary of the Hopi prophecy.) I was stunned by the similarities between the story of the Apocalypse in Revelation and the predictions for the "end time" in Hopi.<br><br>I began to compare different cultures with different religious traditions as a way of finding other similarities in their teachings and sacred mysteries. The more I studied, the more I found varied cultural references to the chakra system. Shortly after my meeting with Grandfather David, I made a journey to the Holy Land. There I found that the chakra system as I knew and understood it meant something different once I was removed from my own culture and cultural heritage. I discovered that the light -- the aura -- and the meaning of the auric colors often differed from culture to culture. In Western society, people tend to think in yellow, daydream in blue, change in green, and get angry in red. While this tendency is not absolute, it is generally consistent. In traveling six hundred miles up the Egyptian Nile I never saw blue or yellow in the auras of Islamic people; I also noticed that aurically their thought process seemed to closely resemble that of the Native American people whom I had observed. Once in Israel, I again saw yellow auric fields, an observation that led me to believe that Israelis tend to "think" more like Europeans and Americans. From these experiences I began to comprehend why, in the Middle East, Israelis and Arabs do not seem to understand each other's way of thinking and why, on our own continent, the Native Americans and nonindigenous peoples fail to understand each other's ways. These observations led me to question whether or not the practices of different religions and particularly prayer positions change the auric colors. I especially began to wonder whether thought was something other than logic as we know it in the West.<br><br>Once I began to explore things in this way, it followed that if an entire culture's thought process was dominated by a particular chakra color, that culture would process reality through that dominant chakra. In other words, since each chakra has a particular "viewpoint," a culture would tend to "see" reality through the "eyes" of that chakra. Furthermore, because each chakra is directly related to a specific area of the body, certain positions and postures of the body would enhance the dominance of one or two colors while inhibiting others. In Islam, for instance, a Moslem bows on a prayer rug, with his knees on the ground. He then puts his forehead (more specifically, his "third eye") on a point that is usually a design on the rug. This posture directs focus to the area around the navel and around the forehead, making the second (orange) and sixth (purple) chakras dominant.<br><br>As one chakra center becomes predominant in a given culture, that chakra "colors" the values, assumptions, and prejudices of that society. This in turn often creates a prevailing one-mindedness or dogmatism. Such narrowness of vision has often determined the characteristics of a culture and the course of an era.<br><br>As far as I can tell, Native Americans are the only people...</p><h2>The Cowboy and the Cossack (Nancy Pearl&#x2019;s Book Lust Rediscoveries)</h2><p><p> Fifteen Montana cowboys sail into Vladivostok with a herd of five hundred longhorns, ready to cross a thousand miles of Siberian wilderness. When a band of Cossacks, Russia&#x2019;s elite horsemen and warriors, shows up to escort these rough and ready Americans to their destination, the clash of cultures begins. The feud between American six shooter and Russian saber is embodied in two men: Shad, the leader of the Montana cowboys, and Rostov, the Cossack commander. Nature and man are enemies that will force them to work together&#x2014;and a ruthless Tartar army that stands between them and their destination. The code of the cowboy West and the credo of the Cossack East seem to be two different measures of a man&#x2014;but honor and courage are the same in any language when a common enemy must be faced. <i>Lonesome Dove</i> meets <i>Dr. Zhivago</i> in this rousing tale of West meets East in the days of the Russian Tsars and the Wild West.</p></p><p><p>Clair Huffaker was a legendary western screenwriter and author.

"Never have I seen my crystal ball so filled with darkness."<br><br>She cupped her hands around the thing, as if to shield my eyes from the horrors that were swimming in its murky depths. As her fingers gripped the glass, I thought I could feel ice water trickling down inside my gullet.<br><br>At the edge of the table, a thin candle flickered, its sickly light glancing off the dangling brass hoops of the Gypsy's earrings, then flying off to die somewhere in the darkened corners of the tent.<br><br>Black hair, black eyes, black dress, red-painted cheeks, red mouth, and a voice that could only have come from smoking half a million cigarettes.<br><br>As if to confirm my suspicions, the old woman was suddenly gripped by a fit of violent coughing that rattled her crooked frame and left her gasping horribly for air. It sounded as though a large bird had somehow become entangled in her lungs and was flapping to escape.<br><br>"Are you all right?" I asked. "I'll go for help."<br><br>I thought I had seen Dr. Darby in the churchyard not ten minutes earlier, pausing to have a word or two at each stall of the church f�te. But before I could make a move, the Gypsy's dusky hand had covered mine on the black velvet of the tabletop.<br><br>"No," she said. "No . . . don't do that. It happens all the time."<br><br>And she began to cough again.<br><br>I waited it out patiently, almost afraid to move.<br><br>"How old are you?" she said at last. "Ten? Twelve?"<br><br>"Eleven," I said, and she nodded her head wearily as though she'd known it all along.<br><br>"I see--a mountain," she went on, almost strangling on the words, "and the face--of the woman you will become."<br><br>In spite of the stifling heat of the darkened tent, my blood ran cold. She was seeing Harriet, of course!<br><br>Harriet was my mother, who had died in a climbing accident when I was a baby.<br><br>The Gypsy turned my hand over and dug her thumb painfully into the very center of my palm. My fingers spread--and then curled in upon themselves like the toes of a chicken's severed foot.<br><br>She took up my left hand. "This is the hand you were born with," she said, barely glancing at the palm, then letting it fall and picking up the other. ". . . and this is the hand you've grown."<br><br>She stared at it distastefully as the candle flickered. "This broken star on your Mount of Luna shows a brilliant mind turned in upon itself--a mind that wanders the roads of darkness."<br><br>This was not what I wanted to hear.<br><br>"Tell me about the woman you saw on the mountain," I said. "The one I shall become."<br><br>She coughed again, clutching her colored shawl tightly about her shoulders, as though wrapping herself against some ancient and invisible winter wind.<br><br>"Cross my palm with silver," she demanded, sticking out a grubby hand.<br><br>"But I gave you a shilling," I said. "That's what it says on the board outside."<br><br>"Messages from the Third Circle cost extra," she wheezed. "They drain the batteries of my soul."<br><br>I almost laughed out loud. Who did this old hag think she was? But still, she seemed to have spotted Harriet beyond the veil, and I couldn't let skepticism spoil even half a chance of having a few words with my dead mother.<br><br>I dug for my last shilling, and as I pressed the coin into her hand, the Gypsy's dark eyes, suddenly as bright as a jackdaw's, met mine.<br><br>"She is trying to come home," she said. "This . . . woman . . . is trying to come home from the cold. She wants you to help her."<br><br>I leapt to my feet, bashing the bottom of the table with my bare knees. It teetered, then toppled to one side as the candle slid off and fell among a tangle of dusty black hangings.<br><br>At first there was a little wisp of black smoke as the flame turned blue, then red, then quickly orange. I looked on in horror as it spread along the drapery.<br><br>In less time than it takes to tell, the entire tent was in flames.<br><br>I wish I'd had the presence of mind to throw a wet cloth over the Gypsy's eyes and lead her to safety, but instead I bolted--straight through the circle of fire that was the entranceway--and I didn't stop until I reached the coconut pitch, where I stood panting behind a canvas drape, trying to catch my breath.<br><br>Someone had brought a wind-up gramophone to the churchyard, from which the voice of Danny Kaye was issuing, made nauseously tinny by the throat of the machine's painted horn:<br><br>"Oh I've got a lov-ely bunch of coconuts.<br><br>There they are a-standin' in a row . . ."<br>I looked back at the Gypsy's tent just in time to see Mr. Haskins, St. Tancred's sexton, and another man whom I didn't recognize heave a tub of water, apples and all, onto the flames.<br><br>Half the villagers of Bishop's Lacey, or so it seemed, stood gaping at the rising column of black smoke, hands over mouths or fingertips to cheeks, and not a single one of them knowing what to do.<br><br>Dr. Darby was already leading the Gypsy slowly away towards the St. John's Ambulance tent, her ancient frame wracked with coughing. How small she seemed in the sunlight, I thought, and how pale.<br><br>"Oh, there you are, you odious little prawn. We've been looking for you everywhere."<br><br>It was Ophelia, the older of my two sisters. Feely was seventeen, and ranked herself right up there with the Blessed Virgin Mary, although the chief difference between them, I'm willing to bet, is that the BVM doesn't spend twenty-three hours a day peering at herself in a looking glass while picking away at her face with a pair of tweezers.<br><br>With Feely, it was always best to employ the rapid retort: "How dare you call me a prawn, you stupid sausage? Father's told you more than once it's disrespectful."<br><br>Feely made a snatch at my ear, but I sidestepped her easily. By sheer necessity, the lightning dodge had become one of my specialties.<br><br>"Where's Daffy?" I asked, hoping to divert her venomous attention.<br><br>Daffy was my other sister, two years older than me, and at thirteen already an accomplished co-torturer.<br><br>"Drooling over the books. Where else?" She pointed with her chin to a horseshoe of trestle tables on the churchyard grass, upon which the St. Tancred's Altar Guild and the Women's Institute had joined forces to set up a jumble sale of secondhand books and assorted household rubbish.<br><br>Feely had seemed not to notice the smoking remnants of the Gypsy's tent. As always, she had left her spectacles at home out of vanity, but her inattentiveness might simply have been lack of interest. For all practical purposes, Feely's enthusiasms stopped where her skin ended.<br><br>"Look at these," she said, holding a set of black earrings up to her ears. She couldn't resist showing off. "French jet. They came from Lady Trotter's estate. Glenda says they were quite fortunate to get a tanner for them."<br><br>"Glenda's right," I said. "French jet is nothing but glass."<br><br>It was true: I had recently melted down a ghastly Victorian brooch in my chemical laboratory, and found it to be completely silicaceous. It was unlikely that Feely would ever miss the thing.<br><br>"English jet is so much more interesting," I said. "It's formed from the fossilized remains of monkey-puzzle trees, you see, and--"<br><br>But Feely was already walking away, lured by the sight of Ned Cropper, the ginger-haired potboy at the Thirteen Drakes who, with a certain muscular grace, was energetically tossing wooden batons at the Aunt Sally. His third stick broke the wooden figure's clay pipe clean in two, and Feely pulled up at his side just in time to be handed the teddy bear prize by the madly blushing Ned.<br><br>"Anything worth saving from the bonfire?" I asked Daffy, who had her nose firmly stuck in what, judging by its spotty oxidized pages, might have been a first edition of Pride and Prejudice.<br><br>It seemed unlikely, though. Whole libraries had been turned in for salvage during the war, and nowadays there wasn't much left for the jumble sales. Whatever books remained unsold at the end of the summer season would, on Guy Fawkes Night, be carted from the basement of the parish hall, heaped up on the village green, and put to the torch.<br><br>I tipped my head sideways and took a quick squint at the stack of books Daffy had already set aside: On Sledge and Horseback to Outcast Siberian Lepers, Pliny's Natural History, The Martyrdom of Man, and the first two volumes of the Memoirs of Jacques Casanova--the most awful piffle. Except perhaps for Pliny, who had written some ripping stuff about poisons.<br><br>I walked slowly along the table, running a finger across the books, all of them arranged with their spines upwards: Ethel M. Dell, E. M. Delafield, Warwick Deeping . . .<br><br>I had noticed on another occasion that most of the great poisoners in history had names beginning with the letter C, and now here were all of these authors beginning with a D. Was I on to something? Some secret of the universe?<br><br>I squeezed my eyes shut and concentrated: Dickens . . . Doyle . . . Dumas . . . Dostoyevsky--I had seen all of them, at one time or another, clutched in Daffy's hands.<br><br>Daffy herself was planning to become a novelist when she was older. With a name like Daphne de Luce, she couldn't fail if she tried!<br><br>"Daff!" I said. "You'll never guess--"<br><br>"Quiet!" she snapped. "I've told you not to speak to me when I'm reading."<br><br>My sister could be a most unpleasant porpoise when she felt like it.<br><br>It had not always been this way. When I was younger, for instance, and Father had recruited Daffy to hear my bedtime prayers, she had taught me to recite them in Pig Latin, and we had rolled among the down-filled pillows, laughing until we nearly split.<br><br>"Od-gay ess-blay Ather-fay, Eely-fay, and Issis-may Ullet-may. And Ogger-day, oo-tay!"<br><br>But over the years, something had changed between my sisters and me.<br><br>A little hurt, I reached for a volume that lay on top of the others: A Looking Glasse, for London and Englande. It was a book, I thought, that would appeal to Feely, since she was mad about mirrors. Perhaps I would purchase it myself, and store it away against the unlikely day when I might feel like giving her a gift, or a peace offering. Stranger things had happened.<br><br>Riffling through its pages, I saw at once that it was not a novel, but a play--full of characters' names and what each of them said. Someone named Adam was talking to a clown:<br><br>". . . a cup of ale without a wench, why, alas, 'tis like an egg without salt or a red herring without mustard."<br><br>What a perfect motto for a certain someone, I thought, glancing across to where Ned was now grazing away at my sister's neck as she pretended not to notice. On more than one occasion I'd seen Ned sitting at his chores in the courtyard of the Thirteen Drakes with a tankard of ale--and sometimes Mary Stoker, the landlord's daughter--at his elbow. I realized with an unexpected shock that without either ale or a female within easy reach, Ned was somehow incomplete. Why hadn't I noticed that before? Perhaps, like Dr. Watson on the wireless in A Scandal in Bohemia, there are times that I see, but do not observe. This was something I needed to think about.<br><br>"Your handiwork, I suppose?" Daffy said suddenly, putting down a book and picking up another. She gestured towards the small knot of villagers who stood gawking at the smoking ruins of the Gypsy's tent. "It has Flavia de Luce written all over it."<br><br>"Sucks to you," I said. "I was going to help carry your stupid books home, but now you can jolly well lug them yourself."<br><br>"Oh, do stop it!" she said, clutching at my sleeve. "Please desist. My heartstrings are playing Mozart's Requiem, and a fugitive tear is making its way to my right eye, even as we speak."<br><br>I wandered away with a careless whistle. I'd deal with her insolence later.<br><br>"Ow! Leave off, Brookie! You're 'urtin' me."<br><br>The whining voice was coming from somewhere behind the shove ha'penny booth and, when I recognized it as belonging to Colin Prout, I stopped to listen.<br><br>By flattening myself against the stone wall of the church and keeping well back behind the canvas that draped the raffle booth, I could eavesdrop in safety. Even better, I was pleased to find that I had an unexpectedly clear view of Colin through the gaps in the booth's raw lumber.<br><br>He was dancing at the end of Brookie Harewood's arm like a great spectacled fish, his thick eyeglasses knocked askew, his dirty blond hair a hayrick, his large, damp mouth hanging open, gasping for air.<br><br>"Leave off. I didn't do nothin'."<br><br>With his other hand, Brookie took hold of the seat of Colin's baggy trousers and swiveled him round to face the smoking remains of the Gypsy's tent.<br><br>"Who did that, then, eh?" he demanded, shaking the boy to accentuate his words. "Where there's smoke, there's fire. Where there's fire, there's matches. And where there's matches, there's Colin Prout."<br><br>" 'Ere," Colin said, trying to ram a hand into his pocket. "Count 'em! You just count 'em, Brookie. Same number as I had yesterday. Three. I ain't used a one."<br><br>As Brookie released his grip, Colin fell to the ground, rolled over on his elbows, dug into his trouser pocket, and produced a box of wooden matches, which he waved at his tormentor.<br><br>Brookie raised his head and sniffed the air, as if for guidance. His greasy cap and India rubber boots, his long moleskin coat and, in spite of the hot summer weather, a woolen scarf that clung like a scarlet serpent to his bulldog neck made him look like a rat catcher out of Dickens.<br><br>Before I could even wonder what to do, Colin had scrambled to his feet, and the two of them had ambled away across the churchyard, Colin dusting himself off and shrugging elaborately, as though he didn't care.<br><br>I suppose I should have stepped out from behind the booth, admitted I was responsible for the fire, and demanded that Brookie release the boy. If he refused, I could easily have run for the vicar, or called for any one of the other able-bodied men who were within earshot. But I didn't. And the simple reason, I realized with a little chill, was this: I was afraid of Brookie Harewood.</p><h2>Gothic Tales (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Elizabeth Gaskell&#39;s chilling Gothic tales blend the real and the supernatural to eerie, compelling effect. &#39;Disappearances&#39;, inspired by local legends of mysterious vanishings, mixes gossip and fact; &#39;Lois the Witch&#39;, a novella based on an account of the Salem witch hunts, shows how sexual desire and jealousy lead to hysteria; while in &#39;The Old Nurse&#39;s Story&#39; a mysterious child roams the freezing Northumberland moors. Whether darkly surreal, such as &#39;The Poor Clare&#39;, where an evil doppelg�nger is formed by a woman&#39;s bitter curse, or mischievous like &#39;Curious, if True&#39;, a playful reworking of fairy tales, all the stories in this volume form a stark contrast to the social realism of Gaskell&#39;s novels, revealing a darker and more unsettling style of writing.</p><p>"The curse -- the curse!" I looked up in terror. In the great mirror opposite I saw myself, and right behind, another wicked, fearful self'<p>An encounter with the supernatural in an everyday setting accentuates its strangeness; a truth used to eerie effect in Gaskell's Gothic tales. A portrait turned to the wall, a hidden manuscript, a mysterious child that lives on the freezing moors, a doppelganger formed by a woman's bitter curse: all of these things hint at male tyranny and woman as avenging angel -- or devil.</p><p>Gaskell was fascinated by the dualities in women's lives and the way in which fact and fiction merge. 'Disappearances', a mix of gossip, legend and fact, relates stories of mysterious vanishings, 'Lois the Witch', a novella based on an account of the Salem witch hunts, shows how sexual desire and jealousy lead to communal hysteria and persecution, while 'The Grey Woman' explores a common Gothic theme, the way in which the ghosts of the past always return to haunt us.</p>Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-65) wrote her first novel, MARY BARTON, in 1848 as a distraction from her sorrow at the death of her only son in infancy. It won the attention of Dickens and was followed by 5 other full-length novels as well as numerous short stories and novellas.

Le Guin discusses her fiction, nonfiction, and poetry?both her process and her philosophy?with all the wisdom, profundity, and rigor we expect from one of the great writers of the last century.</strong></p><p>When the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;referred to Ursula K. Le Guin as America&#x2019;s greatest writer of science fiction, they just might have undersold her legacy. It&#x2019;s hard to look at her vast body of work?novels and stories across multiple genres, poems, translations, essays, speeches, and criticism?and see anything but one of our greatest writers, period.<br><br> In a series of interviews with David Naimon (<em>Between the Cover</em>s), Le Guin discusses craft, aesthetics, and philosophy in her fiction, poetry, and nonfiction respectively. The discussions provide ample advice and guidance for writers of every level, but also give Le Guin a chance to to sound off on some of her favorite subjects: the genre wars, the patriarchy, the natural world, and what, in her opinion, makes for great writing. With excerpts from her own books and those that she looked to for inspiration, this volume is a treat for Le Guin&#x2019;s longtime readers, a perfect introduction for those first approaching her writing, and a tribute to her incredible life and work.</p></p><p><p>Ursula K. Le Guin has published twenty-one novels, eleven volumes of short stories, four collections of essays, twelve books for children, six volumes of poetry and four of translation, and has received the Hugo, Nebula, Endeavor, Locus, Tiptree, Sturgeon, PEN-Malamud, and National Book Award and the Pushcart and Janet Heidinger Kafka prizes, among others.In recent years she has received lifetime achievement awards from the World Fantasy Awards, Los Angeles Times, Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association, and Willamette Writers, as well as the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Grand Master Award, the Library of Congress &#x201c;Living Legends&#x201d; award, and the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.

When Lovelace translated a description of Babbage&#x2019;s plans for an enormous mechanical calculating machine in 1842, she added annotations three times longer than the original work. Her footnotes contained the first appearance of the general computing theory, a hundred years before an actual computer was built. Sadly, Lovelace died of cancer a decade after publishing the paper, and Babbage never built any of his machines.<br><br> But do not despair! <i>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage </i>presents a rollicking alternate reality in which Lovelace and Babbage <i>do</i> build the Difference Engine and then use it to build runaway economic models, battle the scourge of spelling errors, explore the wilder realms of mathematics, and, of course, fight crime&#x2014;for the sake of both London and science. Complete with extensive footnotes that rival those penned by Lovelace herself, historical curiosities, and never-before-seen diagrams of Babbage&#x2019;s mechanical, steam-powered computer, <i>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage </i>is wonderfully whimsical, utterly unusual, and, above all, entirely irresistible.<br><br><b>(With black-and-white illustrations throughout.)&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>SYDNEY PADUA</b> is an animator and visual effects artist, usually employed in making giant monsters appear to be attacking people for the movies.

This is a condition that Frank himself aspires to. But at thirty-eight, he suffers from incurable dreaminess, occasional pounding of the heart, and the not-too-distant losses of a career, a son, and a marriage. In the course of the Easter week in which Ford&#39;s moving novel transpires, Bascombe will end up losing the remnants of his familiar life, though with his spirits soaring.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to imagine a book illuminating the texture of everyday life more brilliantly, or capturing the truth of human emotions more honestly, than Ford does in his account of an alienated scribe in the New Jersey suburbs. Frank Bascombe, Ford&#39;s protagonist, clings to his almost villainous despair in a way that Walker Percy&#39;s men don&#39;t, but the book is heavily influenced by Ford&#39;s fellow southerner nonetheless. Read this and you&#39;re ready for Ford&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning sequel, Independence Day.The author of five novels and two collections of stories, Richard Ford was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award for <b>Independence Day</b>, the first book to win both prizes. In 2001, he received the PEN/Malamud Award for excellence in short fiction.

A White House adviser to four presidents, both Republican and Democrat, he offers a vivid, behind-the-scenes account of their struggles to exercise power and draws from them key lessons for leaders of the future. Taking us inside the administrations of Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton, Gergen reflects on everything from why Nixon was the best global strategist among recent presidents to how the Bill-and-Hillary seesaw rocked the White House during Clinton's tenure as president. <br> Gergen argues that, as the twenty-first century begins, our success as a country will depend heavily upon the success of a new generation in power. Drawing upon his many experiences in the White House, he offers seven vital elements for future leaders. What they must have, he says, are inner mastery; a central, compelling purpose rooted in moral values; a capacity to persuade; skills in working within the system; a fast start; a strong, effective team; and a passion that inspires others to keep the flame alive.</p><p>David Gergen is probably the only person to have served at high levels in both the Reagan and Clinton White Houses--not to mention his posts in the Nixon and Ford administrations. He's a consummate Washington insider, a man who appears regularly as a centrist political commentator on PBS's <i>NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</i> and works as editor at large for <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>. <i>Eyewitness to Power</i>, his first book, draws upon this unique experience. It's part memoir, part political history, part portrait of White House culture, but it's mostly a meditation on what it takes to be a great political leader. Gergen focuses on the four presidents he has known best--Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Clinton--and offers pointed assessments of each. He calls Reagan "the best leader in the White House since Franklin Roosevelt," and says Clinton "is one of the smartest men ever elected president and has done some of the dumbest things." Gergen does not hesitate to offer harsh criticism: Nixon was hateful, Ford was overwhelmed by his predecessor's scandals, Reagan was often detached, and Clinton was not in control of his appetites. Yet there's a reflective admiration for each man.<p> What makes this volume rise above the mountain of books on leadership (usually written for executives) is its spot-on observations about the way Washington works, drawn from years of experience: "Republicans like hierarchy and order; they're not like Democrats, as I saw later on, who thrive on chaos and creativity"; the Nixon view of Watergate "was the same as the Victorians had of adultery: the sin was not in the doing of it but in getting caught"; "In most institutions, the power of a leader grows over time. A CEO, a university president, the head of a union, acquire stature through the quality of their long-term performance. The presidency is just the opposite: power tends to evaporate quickly."</p><p> Gergen concludes by describing the seven leadership qualities a great president must have: personal integrity, a sense of mission, the ability to persuade, the ability to work with other politicians, a strong start after inauguration, skilled advisers, and the ability to inspire. Those traits, of course, will serve people well from all walks of life--and <i>Eyewitness to Power</i> will appeal not just to readers interested in the presidency but to anyone occupying a position of responsibility (or interested in getting there). <i>--John J.

As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide."</em> Abraham Lincoln Nothing is more daring in the American experiment than the founders' belief that the American republic could remain free forever. But how was this to be done, and are Americans doing it today? It is not enough for freedom to be won. It must also be <em>sustained.</em> Cultural observer Os Guinness argues that the American experiment in freedom is at risk. Summoning historical evidence on how democracies evolve, Guinness shows that contemporary views of freedom--most typically, a negative freedom from constraint-- are unsustainable because they undermine the conditions necessary for freedom to thrive. He calls us to reconsider the audacity of sustainable freedom and what it would take to restore it. "In the end," Guinness writes, "the ultimate threat to the American republic will be Americans. The problem is not wolves at the door but termites in the floor." The future of the republic depends on whether Americans will rise to the challenge of living up to America's unfulfilled potential for freedom, both for itself and for the world.</p><p><strong>Os Guinness</strong> (D.Phil., Oxford) is the author or editor of more than twenty-five books, including <em>The American Hour, Time for Truth</em> and <em>The Case for Civility.</em> A frequent speaker and prominent social critic, he was the founder of the Trinity Forum and has been a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution as well as a guest scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Studies. Born in China and educated in England, he now lives near Washington, D.C."<em>A Free People's Suicide</em> challenges each and every citizen concerned about America's diminishing role as a beacon of liberty not only to comprehend the urgency, but also to participate comprehensively in freedom's preservation." (Albin Sadar, The Washington Times, washingtontimes.com)<br><br>"Dr. Guinness' book is rich in its explorations of Lincoln's words and their import for us today. As an expatriate friend of America, Guinness, like de Tocqueville, has a rare gift for helping us see our better selves. He casts a discerning eye at our modern institutions, and habits of the heart&#x2015;as reflected in the broader culture. He freely concedes that there are worrying signs on the horizon, but then, having thoughtfully set out the challenges we face in our historical moment, he brings us back to the best things the founders gave us. On the whole, it's a fascinating perspective from a British citizen." (Kevin Belmonte, Huffington Post Religion Blog, September 1, 2012)<br><br>"Os Guinness enlightens, cheers, chastises and informs with this latest contribution to our civic discourse. Guinness here solidifies his reputation as one of the most nimble voices from the Christian community as he surveys our history and our present with appreciation as well as deep concern. Highly recommended for all interested citizens, whatever their political or faith commitments." (Jean Bethke Elshtain, Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics at the University of Chicago, author of Sovereignty: God, State and Self)<br><br>"<em>A Free People's Suicide</em> is an inside view from the outside. Os Guinness has a clear eye, a quick mind, a profound grasp of political philosophy and an eloquent pen. His analysis of American freedom, what it has been, now is and is likely to become, is a clarion call for renewal of the founders' vision for a free people." (James W. Sire, author of The Universe Next Door and V�clav Havel: The Intellectual Conscience of International Politics)<br><br>"Sometimes a book is so important and so timely that not to have read it is to embarrass oneself. This is such a book. Its message is so crucial and so clear that all Americans are obligated to read it and have a national conversation on its themes. No cultural commentator or politician who has not read this book should ever be taken seriously again. Let this book be the new litmus test. If you are serious about America, be familiar with its themes and expect to discuss them and to be tested on them. Rest assured that you will be, because America is now herself being tested on them. Alas, we will not be graded on a curve. This book's clarion call is both piercing and full of hope. May God help us to hear it and to take action." (Eric Metaxas, author of Bonhoeffer:&nbsp;Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy and Amazing Grace:&nbsp;William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery)<br><br>"With passion and urgency Os Guinness gives a sweeping historical account of America's past and her prospects for the future. He urges us to pay serious attention to a deeper understanding of freedom and makes a compelling case for why freedom requires virtue. Weaving together a wide-ranging knowledge of classical, constitutional and contemporary history, Guinness warns of America's decline but charts a course for America's renewal. It is a straight-shooting and sober volume, yet in the end it is a hopeful book." (Michael Cromartie, vice president, Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington, DC)<br><br>"In a passionate work that blends historical-cultural analysis with moral exhortation, Os Guinness finds at the heart of America's culture wars something different than what many observers have seen. He identifies a 'freedom war,' a struggle over the very concept of freedom itself. As the Founders well understood, it is not enough for Americans to invoke endlessly the name of 'freedom' when they no longer agree as to what it means or what ends freedom is meant to serve. Guinness warns that freedom cannot long endure unless it is consecrated to purposes beyond itself. It is a warning worth heeding." (Wilfred M.

At least those are the attempts that I know about; there could have been more, as my father often ran interference, hiding things that he thought would hurt me. My mother suffered from major depression. She also had migraines. By most accounts they were unusually severe. She almost always had visual effects, seeing strange lines and flashes of light and sometimes hearing voices. When the migraines came she never left her room.<br> <br>Doctors tried to help, though it seemed to me like they were bailing out a sinking boat with a paper cup. Most just medicated her with the latest trending mind drug: Valium, Xanax, Prozac, etc. A few told her to &#x201c;buck up,&#x201d; which was like telling a stage-four cancer patient to just get over it. Then there were the insufferable people who said stupid things like, &#x201c;I was depressed once. I went for a walk,&#x201d; or, &#x201c;You have so much to be thankful for, how can you be depressed?&#x201d; then smugly walked off as if they&#x2019;d just performed a service to society.<br> <br>With my mother almost always ill, my father did his best to pick up the slack. It was not unusual for him to come home from a long day of work, make dinner, clean the kitchen (with my help), then put in the laundry. I could never figure out why my father stayed with her.<br> <br>The Christmas afternoon my mother died was the first time I ever saw my father cry. He also cried at her funeral, which for me was the most upsetting part of the day. I know that sounds weird, but in my young mind, my mother had died long before we buried her.<br> <br>After the funeral, my aunt took me for a couple of days, until my father came and got me and we went on with our lives. Just like that. Just like nothing had happened.<br> <br>My father, Robert Dante Rossi, didn&#x2019;t have a degree, but he was smart. He had started but never finished college (even though he insisted that I did). He was hardworking and good with people. I once heard one of his colleagues describe my father as &#x201c;the kind of guy who could tell you to go to hell and you&#x2019;d look forward to the trip.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was a Vietnam vet and had served two years in the air cavalry, which meant he saw a lot of combat. He rarely talked about those experiences, but he didn&#x2019;t seem overly affected by them either, at least not in the way the movies like to paint Vietnam vets: handicapped in mind and spirit. I remember when I was fifteen I asked him if he had ever killed anyone. He was quiet for almost a minute, then looked at me and said, &#x201c;I served my country.&#x201d;<br> <br>When he got back from the war he went to college for a year before deciding it wasn&#x2019;t for him. He took a job managing a Maverick convenience store in Henderson. After five years and as many promotions, he was in charge of the entire Las Vegas region for Maverick. I don&#x2019;t suppose that he ever made a lot of money, but I never felt like we were poor. My father was disciplined and frugal, the kind of guy who still mowed his own lawn and drove an old Ford Taurus.<br> <br>He did his best to raise me alone. He got up early every day, made my lunch, then drove me to school. He took a late lunch break so he could pick me up after school. I usually just stayed with him as he finished his rounds, talking about my day, then doing my homework in the car when he went inside a store. He&#x2019;d always return with a slushie drink, a chocolate MoonPie, and a couple of fashion or teen magazines&#x2014;the previous months that they were about to throw out. I liked being with him.<br> <br>When I was a little older he decided that as long as I was making the rounds with him I should get paid for it, and he hired me as an employee. I would go into the stores he was visiting and wipe down the soda dispensers and clean the glass on the refrigerators. That&#x2019;s pretty much how my life went during my teenage years.<br> <br><br> <br>My memories of my mother were vague and hazy, perhaps because they were so heavily wrapped in trauma. Most of them were of her in a dark room lying in bed. I didn&#x2019;t really know her. I suppose my father could have filled in the blanks, but the truth is, I didn&#x2019;t want them filled in. The few times my father started to tell me about her I stopped him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to know,&#x201d; I said. Looking back, I think that hurt him, but my intent was the opposite. I was trying to prove to him that I was okay without her. I felt my mother was a failure and a traitor, not just to me but even more to my father. I deserved someone who cared enough about me to stick around and so did he. We both deserved someone better than her.<br> <br>At least that&#x2019;s how I saw it.<br> <br><br> <br>In high school I was one of those girls who always had to have a boyfriend. Starting in the eighth grade, I had a string of boyfriends until my senior year in high school when I started dating Kent Clark. (Yes, people teased him about his name. His friends called him &#x201c;Steel of Man.&#x201d;) Kent was a popular guy. He was on the high school basketball team and lettered in track and wrestling as well.<br> <br>Two years after high school, Kent proposed to me and I said yes. My dad, with a neighbor woman&#x2019;s help, went through all the work of reserving the reception center, caterer, flowers&#x2014;the whole matrimonial shebang.<br> <br>Then the Steel of Man kryptonited the day of the wedding, running off with a high school girlfriend he&#x2019;d dated before me. It was the most humiliating experience of my life. Not the worst experience. Just the most humiliating.<br> <br>Alone, I continued on with college, pursuing my general education where my father had dropped out&#x2014;the University of Nevada&#x2013;Las Vegas. That&#x2019;s where I met Danny, another basketball player. Two years later, I was a fianc�e again.<br> <br>Danny was a walk-on for UNLV&#x2019;s basketball team and quickly moved up to starting forward. I should have known that the odds were against any kind of real relationship with a rising basketball star, but I thought I was in love and was caught up in the thrill of being the future wife of a professional athlete. I soon learned exactly what that meant, which was, to Danny, almost nothing. The more he rose in the public&#x2019;s (and his own) view, the less he regarded us. I began hearing that he was not behaving like a betrothed man on road trips. The next year he was drafted by the Orlando Magic and left Vegas, and me, behind.<br> <br>Twice burned by young athletes, I found Marcus, who was nine years older than me. I also met him at college. He was my history professor, which should have been my first red flag.<br> <br>My father wasn&#x2019;t thrilled with any of the guys I&#x2019;d been with, but for the most part kept his silence. For Marcus he made an exception. He said that a professor dating his student was as unethical as a psychiatrist courting a patient. Still, as much as it pained him, he believed in letting me make my choices no matter how stupid they were. I thought it a great accomplishment that Marcus didn&#x2019;t leave me before we reached the altar.<br> <br>In retrospect, I wish he had. I learned on our honeymoon night the extent of his cruelty. He got drunk at our wedding&#x2014;drunk enough that I drove to our hotel while he yelled at me about how the wedding had been all about me, how I had neglected him, and how selfish I was. In the pain of the moment I begged his forgiveness, but he still made me sleep on the couch in the guest section of the suite my father had paid for. That was our honeymoon night. I suppose it was a preview of how my life would be with him. Before we were married, Marcus couldn&#x2019;t keep his hands off me. Now he wouldn&#x2019;t touch me. I was embarrassed to undress in front of him since he started calling me chunky and telling me that I needed to lose weight, even though I knew I didn&#x2019;t. He criticized me constantly, not just the way I looked, but the things I said, the things I thought, even the music I liked. He constantly called me stupid or ditzy. Nothing I did met his expectations.<br> <br>What I didn&#x2019;t realize until later, much later, was that emotional manipulation was his modus operandi. He was a master at it. He should have taught psychology instead of history. He controlled our relationship by keeping me emotionally needy, giving me just enough &#x201c;love&#x201d; to not give up, but never enough to feel satisfied. It was like filling a dog&#x2019;s water bowl half-full. I never felt like I was enough, and apparently I wasn&#x2019;t. I should have left him, but I didn&#x2019;t. I suppose that I believed, like my father must have, that marriage was for better or for worse.<br> <br>Three years after our marriage, Marcus was offered a bigger paycheck at the University of Colorado in Boulder. I hated leaving my father and Las Vegas, but it was a promotion and Marcus was insistent. I didn&#x2019;t fight it. I believed that supporting my husband was the right thing to do. Also, Marcus frequently complained that I was too close to my father and that it got in the way of our marriage. I thought that the experience of being alone in a strange town would bring us closer together. It didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>I filed for divorce two years later when Marcus was exposed in a campus investigation for ethical misconduct, something you may have read about in the Huffington Post. I&#x2019;ll never forget the night he told me. In a cruel twist of irony, it was Valentine&#x2019;s Day and I had spent the day making him a romantic candlelit dinner. When I stopped crying I asked, &#x201c;Why did you cheat on me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re too clingy,&#x201d; he said stoically. &#x201c;You were suffocating me. You forced me into it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I forced you to cheat on me?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, you did,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Besides, monogamy is unnatural. Anyone with half a brain knows that.&#x201d;<br> <br>That evening when I called my father and told him what had happened, he never once said &#x201c;I told you so.&#x201d; He just wanted to beat Marcus to a pulp, and likely would have if he&#x2019;d been there.<br> <br>The next day the press arrived at our apartment. You wouldn&#x2019;t believe the things they asked me.<br> <br>Press: How do you feel about your husband being sexually involved with six university students?<br> <br>Me: You&#x2019;re really asking me that?<br> <br>Press: Are you upset?<br> <br>Me: . . .<br> <br>After our separation, Marcus ran off with not one but two of his female students. Alone again, I moved forty miles south to Denver. My father wanted me to come back to Las Vegas, but shame kept me away. I didn&#x2019;t want to return home a failure, even if that&#x2019;s what I was.<br> <br>I got a job in Thornton, a suburb of Denver, as a finance officer at a Lexus car dealership, which is where I was the winter this story began.<br> <br>As I look back at where I was in my life at that time, it wasn&#x2019;t so much that my life wasn&#x2019;t what I thought it would be, as that&#x2019;s likely true of all of us. Rather, it&#x2019;s that it wasn&#x2019;t what I wanted it to be. I wanted someone to build a life with, someone who would think about me when they weren&#x2019;t with me. I wanted someone who loved me.<br> <br>I also wanted to live a life of consequence. I wanted to be someone who mattered, which leads to something else you should know about me. In spite of my catastrophic love life, more than anything I wanted to be a romance writer. I know that sounds strange. Me writing about romance is like a vegan writing about barbecue. Still, I couldn&#x2019;t let the dream go. So when I got a flyer in the mail for a romance writers&#x2019; retreat at the Mistletoe Inn, a little voice inside told me that it might be my last chance to find what I was looking for. That voice was far more right than I could have imagined&#x2014;just not in the way I ever imagined it would be.</p><h2>Mercy Watson: Princess in Disguise</h2><p><b>Can visions of treats entice a porcine wonder to wear her princess costume?

Nine years later, her disappearance on an around-the-world flight brought her extraordinary life to an abrupt and mysterious end.<br><br>Based on a decade of archival research through Earhart's letters, journals, and diaries, and drawing on interviews with the aviator's friends and relatives, <i>East to the Dawn</i> provides the most authoritative and richly textured account of both Earhart's record-setting aviation career and her personal life: her early years with her grandparents, her experiences as a nurse and social worker, her famous marriage to publisher George Putnam, and her secret affair with Gene Vidal, head of the Bureau of Air Commerce.

And for Latter-day Saints, the Jesus Christ revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smithy is, in some very significant ways, a different kind of Christ than the Jesus of modern Christianity. The Christ of the restore gospel collaborated with Heavenly Parents for our salvation even before the foundation of the world, "does not anything" save it be for our benefit (2 Nephi 26:24), and is determined to patiently guide and nurture every one of God's children into an eternal heavenly family. Most significantly, this Christ does not rescue us from a condition of original sin or depravity. Rather, He is primarily a healer of the wounds incidient to a long-planned sojourn, one intended to immerse us in the trials, pains, and soul-stretching of this mortal schoolroom. He is not only the most remarkable being in the history of religious through; He is, in fact, <i>The Christ Who Heals.&lt;\i&gt;</i></p><p>Terryl L. Givens holds the James A.

Unsettled by a dark foreboding of menace within the house, she soon comes to believe that something malevolent is stalking the children in her care. But is the threat to her young charges really a malign and ghostly presence or something else entirely? <i>The Turn of the Screw</i> is James's great masterpiece of haunting atmosphere and unbearable tension and has influenced subsequent ghost stories and films such as <i>The Innocents</i>, starring Deborah Kerr, and <i>The Others</i>, starring Nicole Kidman. <br><br> This Penguin Classics edition contains a chronology, further reading, notes and an introduction by David Bromwich examining the dark ambiguity of James's work and the inseparability of narrative from point-of-view.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>The story starts conventionally enough with friends sharing ghost stories 'round the fire on Christmas Eve. One of the guests tells about a governess at a country house plagued by supernatural visitors. But in the hands of Henry James, the master of nuance, this little tale of terror is an exquisite gem of sexual and psychological ambiguity. Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered, <i>The Turn of Screw</i> generates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses. By using a running English-to-Spanish thesaurus at the bottom of each page, this edition of The Turn of the Screw by Henry James was edited for three audiences. The first includes Spanish-speaking students enrolled in an English Language Program (ELP), an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) program, an English as a Second Language Program (ESL), or in a TOEFL� or TOEIC� preparation program. The second audience includes English-speaking students enrolled in bilingual education programs or Spanish speakers enrolled in English speaking schools. The third audience consists of students who are actively building their vocabularies in Spanish in order to take foreign service, translation certification, Advanced Placement� (AP�) or similar examinations.

In his "wee house in the heather," where he lives with his family of twelve, he welcomes to his hearth every weary traveler who passes by on a stormy night. "There's always room for one more," says Lachie, and how his grateful guests say a wonderful "Thank you" provides a delightfully warm and tender ending to this hilarious tale of kindness.</p><p><i>Always Room for One More</i> is the winner of the 1966 Caldecott Medal.</p></p><p>Say you're traveling across Scottish fields and a storm breaks out. Where do you stay for the night? Whether you're a tailor or a sailor or a gallowglass or a fishing lass, you'll be relieved to hear good Lachie MacLachlan shouting from his doorstep, "There's room galore. Och, Come awa' in! There's room for one more, always room for one more!" In this sing-song story, derived from an old Scottish nursery tale, Lachie's boundless magnanimity, while well-received, backfires. The welcoming chap invites all passersby into his home, until the wee house literally explodes with his goodwill. Luckily, the grateful visitors devise a plan to help Lachie and his family (and themselves as well).<p> Sorche Nic Leodhas tells Lachie's story in the lilting, rhyming brogue of a time-worn Scottish folktale. A glossary helps readers through the less intuitive dialect, and Loedhas also provides a musical score so the main chorus of the legend can be sung as originally intended. Nonny Hogrogian's illustrations combine intricately crosshatched line drawings with sponge smudges of moss and berry hues. The effect, impressive enough to earn Hogrogian the Caldecott Medal, is one of a dreamy, watery heath, populated by jovial elfin sprites. The generosity of this tale is addictive, and readers will love being welcomed into Lachie's fold, time and time again. <i>(Picture Book)</i></p><p><b>Sorche Nic Leodhas</b>, author of <i>Thistle and Thyme</i>, a Newbery Honor Book, turns to her childhood to retell this Scottish folktale that was passed on to her by her own grandfather.

In <em>Unlocking the Emotional Brain,</em> authors Ecker, Ticic and Hulley equip readers to carry out focused, empathic therapy using the process found by researchers to induce memory reconsolidation, the recently discovered and only known process for actually unlocking emotional memory at the synaptic level. Emotional memory's tenacity is the familiar bane of therapists, and researchers have long believed that emotional memory forms indelible learning. Reconsolidation has overturned these views. It allows new learning to erase, not just suppress, the deep, unconscious, intensely problematic emotional learnings that form during childhood or in later tribulations and generate most of the symptoms that bring people to therapy. Readers will learn methods that precisely eliminate unwanted, ingrained emotional responses&#x2015;whether moods, behaviors or thought patterns&#x2015;causing no loss of ordinary narrative memory, while restoring clients' well-being. Numerous case examples show the versatile use of this process in AEDP, Coherence Therapy, EFT, EMDR and IPNB.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Bruce Ecker </strong>and <strong>Laurel Hulley </strong>are the originators of Coherence Therapy and coauthors of <em>Depth Oriented Brief Therapy: How To Be Brief When You Were Trained To Be Deep &#x2013; and Vice Versa</em>, the <em>Coherence Therapy Practice Manual&nbsp;and Training Guide, </em>and the <em>Manual of Juxtaposition Experiences: How to Create Transformational Change Using Disconfirming Knowledge in Coherence Therapy.</em> Ecker is&nbsp;codirector of the Coherence Psychology Institute, has taught for many years in graduate programs, and has been in private practice near San Francisco since 1986. Hulley is director of education and paradigm development of the Coherence Psychology Institute and co-founder of the Julia Morgan Middle School for Girls in Oakland, California. </p> <p><strong>Robin Ticic </strong>is director of training and development of the Coherence Psychology Institute and is in private practice near Cologne, Germany, specializing in trauma therapy and clinical supervision of trauma therapists.

What sets this book apart is how these elements are mixed, matched, and delivered to each individual client.

McIntosh</b> is a nationally known author, speaker, educator, consultant, and professor of Christian ministry and leadership at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, located in La Mirada, California. He has written extensively in the field of pastoral ministry, leadership, generational studies, and church growth.<br><br>Dr. McIntosh received his B.A. from Colorado Christian University in Biblical Studies, an M.Div. from Western C.B. Seminary in Pastoral Studies, and a D.Min. from Fuller Theological Seminary in Church Growth Studies.<br><br>As President of <i>The McIntosh Church Growth Network</i>, a church consulting firm he founded in 1989, Dr. McIntosh has served over 500 churches in 53 denominations throughout the United States and Canada. The 1995 and 1996 President of the American Society for Church Growth, he edits both the <i>Church Growth Network</i> newsletter and the <i>Journal of the American Society for Church Growth</i>.Gary McIntosh has done it again with his book entitled, One Size Doesnt Fit All. For whatever reason, most pastors dream and pray towards seeing their ministry grow in influence and numbers. There is nothing wrong with that. At best a small church is a distant cousin of the larger ministry. While sharing some things in common, their diversity must be understood if their ministry is going to realize all that God intended it to be. "Whats good for the goose is not always good for the gander. Dr. McIntosh has the ability to analyze the similarities and differences, surface the important differentiating factors and communicate them effectively to the broader church public. I believe Dr. McIntoshs book will encourage the churches regardless of their size to accept their limitations of their demographics and build solidly on those principles and practices that address their specific individual needs. One Size Doesnt Fit All will encourage, break the complacency of others, and hopefully refocus churches on the realities of their mission accepting both its limitations and potential. Each size ministry has its unique opportunities and its consistent problems. What works on a size C ministry may not be effective at all in a size A ministry. Dr. McIntoshs insights and analytical abilities enable him to surface for us those non-negotiables that must be in place if a ministry of any size is going to be blessed. Building on the non-negotiables are the unique characteristics of the individual church of whatever category. -- <i>Joe Aldrich, president emeritus, Multnomah Bible College and Biblical Seminary</i><br><br>Gary McIntoshs book, One Size Doesnt Fit All, is the easiest and most informative book on church leadership I have ever read. Why didnt a few seminary professors teach me this stuff twenty five years ago? It would have saved me and some parishioners a lot of grief along the way. Garys description of the small, medium, and large church with its needs and expectations is a gold mine of practical insights for all pastors, no matter what size church they lead. This book will be a classic in the area of church leadership and growth. -- <i>Dr. Michael Bradaric, senior pastor, Magnolia Baptist Church, Anaheim, CA</i><br><br>If only I had been able to read this book eighteen years ago when I became a pastor. What a difference it would have made! This is the most significant book Ive read in the last twenty-four months. It is a must read for every pastor, lay leader and committed church member.

This book has my enthusiastic endorsement. -- <i>Dr. Mark Belokonny, church consultant</i><br><br>In this book Dr. Gary McIntosh uses his warm conversational style and vast years of experience in church analysis and consulting to provide a book of wisdom for pastors. We dont need more church growth information, but we do need more wisdom to apply the principles of growth and leadership in the unique context of the churches in which we minister. I believe Gary provides this wisdom in One Size Doesnt Fit All. -- <i>Dr. David H. McKinley, senior pastor, Boca Raton Community Church, Boca Raton, FL</i><br><br>Nobody knows the organizational structure and social dynamics of the church better than my friend Dr. Gary McIntosh. I highly recommend this insightful book, which will enlighten your understanding of the critical differences that exist between various sized churches and how they function. -- <i>Dr. Neil T. Anderson, president and founder, Freedom in Christ Ministries</i><br><br>Reading this book and gleaning its insights into the churchs orientation, structure, direction, growth, and so forth will save the so-called experienced pastor as well as the new pastor much frustration and pain in leading and ministering more effectively in the local church. -- <i>Aubrey Malphurs, professor, Dallas Seminary and President of Vision Ministries International</i><br><br>The church is one of the most important institutions in our society today. In a world thats changing so fast, we need a little help in making sure the church stays on course. Gary McIntoshs new book One Size Doesnt Fit All is helpful to the small or large church trying to grow. This easy to read parable will help us bring out the best in our churches, no matter what their size. -- <i>Ken Blanchard, coauthor of <i>The One Minute Manager</i></i><br><br>Theres something here for all churches. This book is an insightful resource for pastors, church boards and staff, and people interested in church growth. -- <i>CBA Marketplace, July 1999</i><br><br>This book is a process of wisdom for church leaders in understanding the changes that impact churches at each stage of their development. This material was researched well, practical in nature and insightful for all church leaders. After serving in small, medium, and larger churches I wish that this material was available twenty five years ago. I wish every church leader would read and apply these principles. -- <i>Dr. J. Michael Broyles, executive pastor, Grace Baptist Church, Santa Clarita, CA</i><br><br>This is absolutely a great book. Every denominational leader should make sure that their pastors have a copy of this book. It is the most enjoyable, practical, and capsulated version of church growth dynamics I have ever seen. I sat down and read through it in one sitting. It is great information encased in an enjoyable story.

From psychoanalysis and myth to geology and neuroanatomy, from bioanalysis to chronopathy, from spinal colonies of proto-minds to the retroparasitism of the CNS, from &#x201c;railway spine&#x201d; to Elizabeth Taylor's lost gill-slits, this extravagantly comprehensive philosophical adventure uses the spinal cord as a guiding thread to rediscover forgotten pathways in modern thought. <br>Moynihan demonstrates that, far from being an fanciful notion rendered obsolete by advances in biology, spinal catastrophism dramatizes fundamental philosophical problematics of time, identity, continuity, and the transcendental that remain central to any attempt to reconcile human experience with natural history.</p></p><p>Thomas Moynihan focuses on intellectual history and existential risk, aiming to supply a historically reflective dimension to the emerging field of "future studies.&#x201d;</p><h2>Smoke Screen</h2><p>From the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestsellng author of <i>Seeing Red </i>comes a "scorching...action-filled" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) tale of corruption and betrayal, revenge, and reversal.<br><br>When newswoman Britt Shelley wakes up to find herself in bed with Jay Burgess, a star detective in the Charleston PD, she remembers nothing of how she got there&#x2014;or how Jay wound up dead.

Without cream to dilute it, Raley thought it better to pass.<br> <br>He glanced at the silent TV. &#x201c;You need to adjust your rabbit ears.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t the rabbit ears. I turned off the sound.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How come?&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man replied with one of his customary harrumphs that said he couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to answer. A self-proclaimed recluse, he had lived in voluntary exile ever since &#x201c;the war,&#x201d; although which war had never been specified. He had as little as possible to do with other Homo sapiens.<br> <br>Shortly after Raley had moved into the vicinity, the two had come upon each other in the woods. Raley was staring down into the beady eyes of a dead opossum when the old man came crashing through the underbrush and said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About taking my possum.&#x201d;<br> <br>Touching the bloated, flyblown, limp body with the pink, hairless tail and horrible stench was the last thing Raley intended to do. He raised his hands in surrender and stood aside so the barefoot old man in stained overalls could retrieve his kill from the metal jaws of the small trap.<br> <br>&#x201c;Way you been stampin&#x2019; &#x2019;round out here, it&#x2019;s a wonder to me it ain&#x2019;t you caught in this trap &#x2019;stead of the possum,&#x201d; he grumbled.<br> <br>Raley wasn&#x2019;t aware that anyone lived within miles of the cabin he&#x2019;d recently purchased. He&#x2019;d rather not have had a neighbor of any kind, but especially one who kept track of his comings and goings.<br> <br>As the old man stood up, his knees protested in loud pops and snaps, which caused him to grimace and mutter a string of curses. With the carcass dangling from his hand, the old man looked Raley over, from his baseball cap and bearded face to the toes of his hiking boots. Inspection complete, the old man spat tobacco juice into the dirt to express his opinion of what he saw. &#x201c;Man&#x2019;s got a right to walk in the woods,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t go messin&#x2019; with my traps.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It would help me to know where they are.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man&#x2019;s cracked lips spread into a wide grin, revealing tobacco-stained stubs that once were teeth. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t it though?&#x201d; Still chuckling, he turned away. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find &#x2019;em, I&#x2019;m bettin&#x2019;.&#x201d; Raley could hear his laughter long after he disappeared into the dense foliage.<br> <br>Over the ensuing months, they&#x2019;d accidentally bumped into each other in the woods several times. At least to Raley these were chance meetings. He reasoned the old man made himself visible when he wanted to and didn&#x2019;t when he was disinclined to give his new neighbor even a grunt of a greeting.<br> <br>One hot afternoon, they met in the doorway of the general store in the nearest town. Raley was coming in, the old man going out. They nodded to each other. Later, when Raley left with several sacks of groceries, he noticed the old man sitting in a chair on the shaded porch of the store, fanning himself with his straw hat. Acting on impulse, Raley peeled a cold can of beer from the plastic webbing and tossed it to the old man, who, revealing excellent reflexes, caught it in one hand.<br> <br>Raley stowed his groceries in the bed of his pickup and climbed into the cab. The old man regarded him with patent suspicion as he put the truck in reverse and backed away, but Raley noticed that he&#x2019;d popped the top on the beer.<br> <br>The following morning there was hard knocking on Raley&#x2019;s door. This being a first, he approached the door cautiously. The old man was there, holding a chipped ceramic bowl containing a heap of some raw animal flesh that Raley couldn&#x2019;t identify. He feared it was carrion that even the trio of hounds had rejected.<br> <br>&#x201c;In exchange for the beer. I don&#x2019;t like bein&#x2019; beholden to nobody.&#x201d;<br> <br>Raley took the bowl thrust at him. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; His visitor turned and walked down the steps. Raley called after him, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who wants to know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Raley Gannon.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man hesitated, then grumbled, &#x201c;Delno Pickens.&#x201d;<br> <br>From that morning, they developed a quasi friendship founded on loneliness and a shared reluctance for interaction with other people.<br> <br>The sum-total value of Delno&#x2019;s possessions wouldn&#x2019;t be a hundred dollars. He was always dragging home something he&#x2019;d salvaged from God knew where, items he had no practical use for. His cabin was situated on stilts to prevent it from flooding when the Combahee overflowed its banks. Junk had been stuffed into the crawl space beneath the structure, as though to provide a more solid foundation. The area surrounding the cabin was also littered with junk that was never utilized so far as Raley could tell. Collecting it seemed more important to Delno than the articles themselves.<br> <br>He drove a truck that Raley called Frankenstein because it was made of parts Delno had assembled himself, held together with baling wire and duct tape. It was a miracle to Raley that he ever got the contraption started, but as Delno said, &#x201c;It ain&#x2019;t pretty, but it gets me anywhere I want to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>He would eat anything. Anything. Anything he could knock from a tree, trap, or pull out of the river. But whatever he had, once their friendship had been established, he was always willing to share it.<br> <br>Surprisingly, he was very well read and conversant on subjects which, to look at him, one wouldn&#x2019;t have expected him to have even a passing knowledge of. Raley came to suspect that his hillbilly accent and vocabulary were affected. Like the squalor he lived in, they were protests against a former life.<br> <br>But whatever that former life had entailed remained Delno&#x2019;s secret. He never mentioned a hometown, his childhood or parents, an occupation, children, or wife. Beyond his hounds, he talked to no one except Raley. Intimate relationships were limited to a stack of old nudie magazines with well-thumbed pages, which he kept on the floor beneath his cot.<br> <br>Raley shared nothing personal with Delno, either. Not for the first two years of their acquaintanceship. And then one evening at sunset, Delno showed up at Raley&#x2019;s cabin, bringing with him two Mason jars filled with a murky liquid that he&#x2019;d fermented himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen you in over a week. Where you been?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Raley didn&#x2019;t want company, but Delno elbowed his way inside anyway. &#x201c;Thought you might be needin&#x2019; a swig or two.&#x201d; Giving Raley one of his scornful once-overs, he added, &#x201c;Lookin&#x2019; at you, I&#x2019;d say my hunch was right. You appear to be in bad shape. Could smell you as I was coming up the steps.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a fine one to criticize someone else&#x2019;s appearance and personal hygiene.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;d you call?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That blabbermouth that runs the cash register at the store? The one with her hair piled up high, wears long, dangly earrings? Told me you come in there last week, got a handful of change, and fed it into the pay phone outside. Said you talked a few minutes, then hung up, looking like you was ready to kill somebody. Got in your truck and took outta there without even paying for your groceries.&#x201d;<br> <br>He uncapped one of the jars and passed it to Raley, who sniffed the contents, then shook his head and passed it back. &#x201c;So, I&#x2019;m askin&#x2019;,&#x201d; Delno continued after taking a hefty swallow from the jar, &#x201c;who&#x2019;d you call?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was dawn before Raley stopped talking. By then, Delno had drained both jars. Raley was simply drained&#x2014;emotionally, mentally, physically. It had been a painful but therapeutic catharsis. He had lanced a dozen wounds.<br> <br>With nothing more to say and no breath left to say it, Raley looked over at the old man, who had listened for hours without making a single comment. The expression on the creased, leathery face was one of profound sadness. His eyes were naked and unguarded for the first time since Raley had known him, and Raley knew he was looking straight into the soul of a man who&#x2019;d experienced indescribable heartache. It seemed Delno Pickens had collected all the misery and injustice in the world and packed it into that one hopeless gaze.<br> <br>Then he sighed, and in one of the rare times they&#x2019;d ever made physical contact, reached across the space separating them and patted Raley on the knee. &#x201c;Go wash your armpits before the stink of you makes me puke up all that good liquor. I&#x2019;ll cook you some breakfast.&#x201d;<br> <br>They never again referred to anything Raley had told him that night. It was as though the long night had never happened. But Raley never forgot the bleakness with which Delno had looked at him that morning. And this morning when he raised his head from staring into his coffee mug and looked up at Raley, he was wearing that same expression of despair.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d; Raley&#x2019;s heart hitched, automatically thinking disaster. A 747 loaded with passengers crashing into a mountainside. A presidential assassination. A terrorist attack on the scale of 9/11.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go and do somethin&#x2019; crazy, now, okay?&#x201d; Delno said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br> <br>Muttering dire predictions about &#x201c;nothin&#x2019; good comin&#x2019; outta this,&#x201d; Delno hitched his chin toward the TV.<br> <br>Raley went over to the vintage set and turned the volume knob, then fiddled with the rabbit-ear antenna in the hope of getting a better picture.<br> <br>The video remained erratic and the audio was scratchy, but within moments he had a clear understanding of what had happened and why Delno had dreaded telling him:<br> <br>Jay Burgess was dead.</p><h2>To Tame a Highland Warrior (Highlander, Book 2)</h2><p>Only her love could gentle his savage soul&#x2014;<br><br>He was born to a clan of warriors of supernatural strength, but Gavrael McIllioch abandoned his name and his Highland castle, determined to escape the dark fate of his ancestors.

Eight days later, France accepted a humiliating defeat and foreign occupation. Subsequently, an eerie sense of normalcy settled over the City of Light. Many Parisians keenly adapted themselves to the situation-even allied themselves with their Nazi overlords. At the same time, amidst this darkening gloom of German ruthlessness, deportations, shortages, and curfews, a resistance arose. Parisians of all stripes---Jews, immigrants, adolescents, communists, rightists, cultural icons such as Colette, de Beauvoir, Camus, and Sartre, as well as police officers, teachers, students, and store owners---rallied around a little-known French military officer, Charles de Gaulle. <br><br>WHEN PARIS WENT DARK evokes with stunning precision the detail of daily life in a city under occupation, and the brave people who fought against the darkness. Relying on a range of resources---memoirs, diaries, letters, archives, interviews, personal histories, flyers and posters, fiction, photographs, film and historical studies---Rosbottom has forged a groundbreaking book that will forever influence how we understand those dark years in the City of Light.<br><br></p><p><b>Ronald C.

He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts."Ronald C. Rosbottom's rigorously researched and deeply compelling book, <i>When Paris Went Dark</i>, examines the relationship between the occupiers and the occupied, specifically how the vanquished Parisians either fought against or adapted to the conditions imposed by their Nazi rulers....Rosbottom strikes a perfect tone that is neither too scholarly nor too familiar and produces a chronicle that edifies as it entertains."&#x2015;<b>Malcom Forbes</b>, <b><i><em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em></i></b><br><br>"Ronald C. Rosbottom's <i>When Paris Went Dark: The City of Light Under German Occupation, 1940-1944 </i>resonated eerily with 2017 America. From its analysis of the French right's rise to power and the many attempts to deny what was occurring, to its nuanced exploration of how both government and average French citizen resisted--or collaborated with--the occupiers, this book is a compelling, sobering warning about the dangers of complacency in the face of intolerance."&#x2015;<b>Celeste Ng</b>, <b><i><i>Wall Street Journal</i></i></b><br><br>"A well-rounded overview....The strength of Mr. Rosbottom's book lies in the details he has culled from memoirs, letters, papers, films, plays, songs, and diaries that illuminate the experience of both the occupiers and the occupied."&#x2015;<b>Caroline Moorehead</b>, <b><i><em>Wall Street Journal</em></i></b><br><br>"A profound historical portrait of Paris for anyone who loves the city."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Dallas Morning News</em></i></b><br><br>"A riveting account of one of the most resonant hostage-takings in history: the 1,500 days when a swastika flew from the Eiffel Tower. Ronald Rosbottom illuminates every corner of a darkened, heartsick city, exploring the oddities, capturing the grisly humor, and weighing the prices of resistance, accommodation, collaboration.

Backman relies upon a consistent set of questions: What did people think and feel throughout the centuries about politics, science, religion, and sex?

It contains definitive essays on the relation of the Torah to Jewish mysticism, the mythology of the kabbalah, and the place of Jewish mystics in the Jewish community. This book helped reinvigorate 20th-century Jewish studies with an awareness of the living reality of God, after the 19th century's more astringent scholarly emphasis on law and philosophy. It shows how Jewish mystics have been less concerned with adherence to orthodoxy than their Christian counterparts, and freer in their expression of the divine aspects of eroticism. Furthermore, Scholem offers great insight regarding the ways that kabbalah has not only threatened the authority of institutional religion, but also served as a source of its vitality. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, Gershom Scholem guides the reader through the central themes in the intricate history of the Kabbalah, clarifying the relations between mysticism and established religious authority, the mystics&#39; interpretation of the Torah and their attempts to discover the hidden meaning underlying Scripture, the tension between the philosophical and the mystical concepts of God, and the symbolism employed in mystical religion.</p><h2>Crazy Horse: A Life</h2><p>Legends cloud the life of Crazy Horse, a seminal figure in American history but an enigma even to his own people in his own day. This superb biography looks back across more than 120 years at the life and death of this great Sioux warrior who became a reluctant leader at the Battle of Little Bighorn. With his uncanny gift for understanding the human psyche, Larry McMurtry animates the character of this remarkable figure, whose betrayal by white representatives of the U.S. government was a tragic turning point in the history of the West. A mythic figure puzzled over by generations of historians, Crazy Horse emerges from McMurtry&#x2019;s sensitive portrait as the poignant hero of a long-since-vanished epoch.</p><p>In writing his superb life of Crazy Horse, Larry McMurtry faced the same obstacle as every previous biographer of the Oglala Sioux icon: a notable paucity of facts. This didn't inhibit such chroniclers as Mari Sandoz or Stephen Ambrose (whose dual portrait of Crazy Horse and George Custer featured a certain amount of authorial ventriloquism). In this case, however, the shortage of documentation actually works to the reader's advantage. Unencumbered by reams of scholarly detail, McMurtry's book has the shapeliness and inevitability of a fine novella. The author may describe it as an "exercise in assumption, conjecture, and surmise"--but his phrase does scant justice to this elegant, admirably scrupulous portrait.<p> As McMurtry recounts, Crazy Horse was born around 1840 in what is now South Dakota. Already the arrival of white settlers--who brought with them such mixed blessings as metal tools, firearms, and smallpox--had begun to transform the culture of the Plains Indians. But soon a more ominous note crept into the relationship: "The Plains Indians were beginning to be seen as mobile impediments; what they stood in the way of was progress, a concept dear to the American politician." As whites sought to remove these impediments with increasing brutality, Crazy Horse led his people in a sporadic and ultimately doomed resistance, which peaked at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Within a year the young warrior (and occasional visionary) had surrendered to the United States Army. Four months later he was dead, stabbed in a highly suspicious scuffle with white <i>and</i> Indian policemen, and the Sioux resistance died with its legendary leader.</p><p> McMurtry's powers of compression are formidable. In no more than a few rapid paragraphs, he gives a sense of how this "prairie Platonist" divided the world into transient things and eternal, invisible spirits. He also conveys his opinion of Caucasian double-dealing with fine, acerbic efficiency: "In August, Custer emerged and described the beauties of the Black Hills in mouthwatering terms. In another life he would have made a wonderful real-estate developer. In this case he sold one of the most beautiful pieces of real estate in the West to a broke, depressed public who couldn't wait to get into those hills and start scratching up gold." McMurtry's <i>Crazy Horse</i> is the leanest and least rhetorical version yet of this American tragedy--which makes it, oddly enough, among the most moving. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><b>Larry McMurtry</b> is the author of twenty-one bestselling novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <b>Lonesome Dove</b> and <b>The Last Picture Show</b>.

Each speech has an insightful introduction on the current relevance of Dr. King&#39;s words by such renowned defenders of civil rights as Rosa Parks, the Dalai Lama, and Ambassador Andrew Young, among others.</p><p>Dr. Carson was born in Buffalo, New York. His wife, Susan Ann Carson, is managing editor of the<i>King Papers Project.</i>The Carsons, who live in Palo Alto, have two grown children.A CALL TO CONSCIENCE is composed of original recordings of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., including the famed "I Have a Dream" speech in Washington. The quality of some is poor, but the words are still understandable. And the tinny nature of some only adds to the realism. It makes listeners feel like they are sitting in the back of a Baptist church hearing history being made. Each speech is introduced by an essay by another prominent civil rights activist. Some, such as the one by the Dalai Lama, are personal reminiscences, as well as inspirational charges in their own right. Others are meant to set the scene for King's speech and discuss its impact.

But what is the key to unlocking the great lessons of Esther? It is this: Read correctly, the lead character of the book of Esther is not even Esther. The lead character is God.

Rachel Calof&#x2019;s Story combines her memoir of a hard pioneering life on the prairie with scholarly essays that provide historical and cultural background and show her narrative to be both unique and a representative western tale. Her narrative is riveting and candid, laced with humor and irony.</p><p>The memoir, written by Rachel Bella Calof in 1936, recounts aspects of her childhood and teenage years in a Jewish community, (shtetl) in Russia, but focuses largely on her life between 1894 and 1904, when she and her husband carved out a life as homesteaders. She recalls her horror at the hardships of pioneer life&#x2015;especially the crowding of many family members into the 12 x 14&#x2019; dirt-floored shanties that were their first dwellings. "Of all the privations I knew as a homesteader," says Calof, "the lack of privacy was the hardest to bear." Money, food, and fuel were scarce, and during bitter winters, three Calof households&#x2015;Abraham and Rachel with their growing children, along with his parents and a brother&#x2019;s family&#x2015;would pool resources and live together (with livestock) in one shanty.</p><p>Under harsh and primitive conditions, Rachel Bella Calof bore and raised nine children.

In this fascinating examination of the roots of human trust and virtue, a zoologist and former American editor of the <b>Economist</b> reveals the results of recent studies that suggest that self-interest and mutual aid are not at all incompatible. In fact, he points out, our cooperative instincts may have evolved as part of mankind's natural selfish behavior&#x2014;by exchanging favors we can benefit ourselves as well as others.Brilliantly orchestrating the newest findings of geneticists, psychologists, and anthropologists, <b>The Origins of Virtue</b> re-examines the everyday assumptions upon which we base our actions towards others, whether in our roles as parents, siblings, or trade partners. With the wit and brilliance of <b>The Red Queen</b>, his acclaimed study of human and animal sexuality, <b>Matt Ridley</b> shows us how breakthroughs in computer programming, microbiology, and economics have given us a new perspective on how and why we relate to each other.</p><p>Human life, scientific journalist Matt Ridley suggests, is a complex balancing act: we behave with self-interest foremost in mind, but also in ways that do not harm, and sometimes even benefit, others. This behavior, in a strange way, makes us good. It also makes us unique in the animal world, where self-interest is far more pronounced. &#34;The essential virtuousness of human beings is proved not by parallels in the animal kingdom, but by the very lack of convincing animal parallels,&#34; Ridley writes. How we got to be so virtuous over millions of years of evolution is the theme of this entertaining book of popular science, which will be of interest to any student of human nature.<b>Matt Ridley</b> has worked as a science editor, Washington correspondent, and American editor for the <i>Economist</i>.

Or, like, Martha Washington or something?" one of the boys edging toward the front of Allison Leigh's tour asked. He was about nine or ten, still awkward, but obviously determined to create some havoc&#x2014;no doubt to avoid embarrassing himself in front of the few other teens and preteens on the tour.<br><br>A taller, older boy, maybe twelve, who might have been his brother, nudged him. "You idiot, they're both dead, and she's alive. And she's hot, buddy. She's way too hot even in that getup to be one of <em>those</em> old ladies." The second boy tried to look mature. He reminded Allison of a very young Adam Sandler. The boys were part of her tour, which included a mix of ages. Summer was just drawing to a close and families were still on vacation.<br><br>She heard someone behind her choke back laughter; it was Nathan Pierson, longtime board member for the nonprofit organization that now owned the Tarleton-Dandridge House. They'd had a meeting in the attic, where a small office was located. Cherry Addison, the remaining descendent of the Dandridge clan, had already moved on, spike heels clicking. Ethan Oxford, their eldest member, had politely made his way through the crowd. Nathan and Sarah Vining were the last of the four board members to leave the house.<br><br>Nathan grinned and winked at Allison as he approached. Sarah hurried to catch up with him. She was a wisp of a woman who had given herself frown lines worrying about the board's every move, while Nathan was the opposite, always certain things would work out. He was a slim and stately man in his forties, not exactly a father figure, more like a cool-uncle figure. And he was amused.<br><br>Ally shot him a warning glance, but he kept grinning as he stepped past her. When he looked back and winked again, she forced a smile to her lips and turned her attention back to the group.<br><br>"Well, thanks, I think," she told the boy who'd spoken. There was nothing like having a few young kids on the tour, giggling and not the least bit interested in the history of the Tarleton-Dandridge House&#x2014;or the nation, for that matter. They didn't want to be here and were going to be thorns in her side if she didn't do something quickly. Ghost tours were the answer in situations like this.<br><br>To most kids an old house just seemed stuffy and boring. She understood how they felt, even though she'd always been the odd kid out herself&#x2014;a history nerd, as Julian liked to call her. She was from Philadelphia; she'd gone to Boston for her bachelor and master's, and to New York for her doctorate, but she loved her own city almost as if it were a friend with whom she'd grown up. From the time she was little, she'd gaped at Independence Hall and marveled that she could stand in the same place where some of the greatest men in American history had stood.<br><br>She surveyed the crowd and concluded that the two boys were indeed brothers, dragged along on a historical jaunt by their parents, the attractive couple a few feet back.<br><br>"Actually, my name is Allison Leigh, and the person I'm dressed to portray is Lucy Tarleton. And," she added teasingly, "she's supposed to haunt the place, so I'd be careful if I were you." She took a step closer to the taller of the two brothers. "She wants you to know your history."<br><br>He grinned and struck a swaggering pose. "I wouldn't mind meeting up with a hot ghost," he said. "And I know all about her. Lucy Tarleton, that is. We went on a ghost tour last night! She was a <em>spy.</em> Like a Hairy Mata."<br><br>"Mata Hari!" his dad whispered, shaking his head in amusement but setting a hand on the boy's shoulders. "Sorry!" he murmured to Allison.<br><br>"It's fine," Allison assured him. She turned back to the boy. "Great, then you're in the know," she said gravely. "You could meet up with Lucy today. Or maybe the ghost of Lord Brian 'Beast' Bradley, who is said to have murdered several patriots in cold blood, among them Lucy Tarleton."<br><br>"Ghosts? Bring 'em on!" the boy shouted.<br><br>"Todd," his father chastised. "Keep it down."<br><br>"It's all right. Everyone loves historic ghost stories," Allison said. She did like kids and understood that they were going to be, well, kids. She just wished people would recognize the human toll of war and what history could teach them.<br><br>She stepped back to welcome her entire group of fifteen. "Good evening," she said loudly, "and welcome to the Tarleton-Dandridge House, here in historic Philadelphia!"<br><br>Trees swayed gently in the breeze, and the air had taken on a sweet chill that might have been the promise of rain or merely the slow descent from summer into fall. Dusk was coming, and with it, a soft fog. They hadn't shortened their hours at the mansion yet, but the last tour was usually out while there was still a glimmer of light in the sky.<br><br>Watching the sky and feeling the breeze, Allison Leigh thought she didn't mind the long days at all, even if she was tired tonight. Of course, a lot of what she did was by rote and she could do it in her sleep, but she was fascinated by history, and adored the old historic house where she worked as a guide when her teaching schedule allowed. Summers generally meant full-time guiding. She liked people, too, especially children and young adults, and valued the opportunity to show them where the fate of a nation had been decided and to discuss both the Colonial era and the Revolution itself.<br><br>On most busy days the other three guides did their share of the tours. Annette Fanning, a good friend as well as coworker, had left early, scheduled for a root canal. Jason Lawrence was leading the tour group just ahead, dressed in the manner of the British dandy, Lord Bradley, who'd resided in the house when the patriots had fled. Julian Mitchell, the fourth guide employed by the private nonprofit corporation that owned the house, had disappeared around lunchtime. He was an effective guide, but he was also running around auditioning with his band, and had a tendency to show up late or disappear early. With the last of the school-age crowd going through at the tail end of summer, his lack of responsibility was irritating, but this tour was it for the night&#x2014;and then she'd be ready to close up and go home. They all liked Julian; he was just driving them crazy.<br><br>"Watch out! A ghost's going to follow you home," a young man in the crowd whispered to the boys. He smiled, looking at the young woman with him, his wife or girlfriend, as if watching the boys because he might want a few of his own one day.<br><br>"I don't think ghosts follow you home," the younger of the two brothers said bravely. "I mean, they're supposed to haunt a <em>place,</em> right?"<br><br>"Maybe they <em>can</em> follow you home!" his brother teased. "They can go through walls, can't they?"<br><br>"Stop it!" the younger one said.<br><br>His brother made chicken sounds.<br><br>Allison clapped her hands to draw their attention back to the tour. "The Tarleton-Dandridge House is open to help you understand the Revolutionary War and the occupation of Philadelphia, not to send ghosts home with anyone," she announced. "So, we'll start with a brief history, although I'm sure you know most of this. Philadelphia was the first capital of the United States. And the Declaration of Independence was written and signed here. But by that time, shots had been fired in Boston&#x2014;and the British navy was occupying Staten Island. What you may not realize is that the First Continental Congress worked here before they decided on independence. At first, they were seeking a means to achieve...can someone tell me?"<br><br>Oddly enough, it was her swaggering young beau, the older brother, who raised his hand. "No taxation without representation!" he said.<br><br>"Very good. So, since it looked like the royal foot was coming down to punish the colonies for their revolt against taxes&#x2014;and they'd already risked being hanged for protesting lack of representation, the next step was to go all the way. Make the stakes worth the consequences, in other words. But it wasn't the citizens of Philadelphia who were eager for war, or at least not all of them. Remember, this area was settled by the Quaker William Penn. He granted the city its charter. Those who believe in the Quaker creed are and have always been antiwar and antiviolence, but by the time of the American Revolution, this was a city of about thirty thousand, all mixed in their beliefs and backgrounds."<br><br>"Yeah! They were ready to fight for freedom!" the older boy said.<br><br>She nodded. "By then the colonies had formed the Second Continental Congress, so a fight for independence it became. But Philadelphia would pay the price. The British wanted the capital. According to their logic, if you took the capital, the rest of the upstarts would fall apart and surrender. However, General George Washington had learned from his Indian wars, and he waged a different kind of warfare. Still, we lost many battles and, as I said, Philadelphia and her residents paid a heavy toll."<br><br>She seemed to have won over the boys, which pleased her, and they were looking at her intently now rather than gawking.<br><br>"Gentlemen, if you will?" she asked the two brothers.<br><br>They actually seemed nervous as she walked back to the podium by the gate. She took out two mock Colonial muskets and gave them to the boys. The male guides carried exceptionally accurate reproduction muskets, but to entertain young adults before entering the house, the guides used mock-up plastic muskets.<br><br>"Now, how would you feel if I put you twenty feet apart and told you to shoot at each other? Do you think it would make a lot of sense?"<br><br>"You shoot enough and.I guess we could hit each other," the taller boy said. "Eventually."<br><br>"Maybe," the younger brother added.<br><br>She nodded. "Muskets of the day weren't great on aim. For every shot, a man had to load his powder, tamp it down and hope the enemy wasn't upon him before he could fire again. What are your names?" she asked the boys.<br><br>The younger brother was Jimmy, she discovered, and the older one was Todd. She had them perform and they followed her instructions, demonstrating a manner of fighting in which they walked toward each other, and then another manner, in which one of them hid behind a tree.<br><br>"George Washington had learned well, don't you think? He knew the British could outman, outpower and outdiscipline him. So if they wanted the city, he'd take to the countryside. Back in the 1770s, for about a hundred miles all around Philadelphia, there was nothing but wilderness. Washington could abandon the city, let the British move in for a while, and the Revolutionary government could keep trying to sway the French to join us, which happened in 1778. And the British knew they could become locked in, trapped. So they in turn had to abandon the city."<br><br>Allison checked the little watch she wore on a chain around her neck, and saw that she'd given Jason plenty of time to take his group through.<br><br>"Shall we enter the house?" she said, opening the gate that led up to the handsome brick house.<br><br>"Let's go!" Todd blurted out.<br><br>She arched a brow at him. He grinned, and she smiled back.<br><br>As she led her group into the small but beautifully manicured yard, Allison told them, "The house was built in 1752 of brick and stone, in what was known as the Flemish style, with alternating longer and shorter bricks. It was built for Lucy Tarleton's father, an Irish immigrant who rose to success and attained great riches as a merchant&#x2014;and had no love for the British King George."<br><br>"Mad King George!" Jimmy said.<br><br>"Yes, so they called him." Allison paused on the porch, waiting for the stragglers to catch up.<br><br>"King George never set foot here, of course," she went on. "The days of kings leading their men into battle were long gone. But as for King George's war," Allison said, "there were two English brothers in control of the war effort here&#x2014;Admiral Richard Howe on the water and General William Howe on land. One thing they hoped, of course, was that many citizens would be loyal to Britain and start coming out of the woodwork when they arrived."<br><br>"And there <em>were</em> citizens loyal to Great Britain, right?" Jimmy asked.<br><br>"Yep. There were citizens loyal to Great Britain, although many moved to Canada&#x2014;the United Empire Loyalists&#x2014;when the war began. But this city was a prize to the British, harder to obtain than they'd expected."<br><br>"The rivers weren't deep enough for the Royal navy!" Todd said. "I know that because we've been on so many history tours already!"<br><br>"Exactly," Allison agreed. "And there were numerous unseen obstacles under the water. It was difficult!<br><br>But eventually they made their way here." She continued the story she'd told so many times before. "Philadelphia fell to the British, and was held by them from September 26, 1777, through June 18, 1778. General Washington deprived them of greater victory by seeing that the city was abandoned and the Continental Congress moved to New York City. The British set up a puppet government in Philadelphia for that nine-month period. Meanwhile, the British soldiers enjoyed the warmth and comfort of some of these splendid homes, while Washington's men froze at Valley Forge. And so here, at this beautiful mansion, Lucy Tarleton stayed behind, pretending to be loyal to the Crown, throwing parties, and even feigning a romance with Lord Brian Bradley&#x2014;soon to be known as 'Beast' Bradley, and soon to execute&#x2014;without trial or king's command&#x2014;the lovely patriot, Lucy Tarleton. Lucy was indeed passing British secrets to General Washington down in Valley Forge. She was passionate about her cause and she was to die for her efforts, in a rare but tragically vindictive incident. Follow me."<br><br>The front door led through a tiny mudroom with cut-glass windows and then into a grand foyer. "In the city, you'll find that many businesses were on the first floors of what are now historic buildings, while the living quarters were upstairs. But here, a servant would greet guests in the foyer, and determine where they'd go. Mr. Tarleton's study was to your right, while the salon was the first room to your left," she said, gesturing in those directions. "The kitchen is still a separate house out back, which prevented a cooking fire from reaching the main house. Beyond the salon is the dining room, and it gave the servants easy access to the kitchen. The left side of the house as you face me was the entertainment area, you might say, and to your right were the family rooms. In back of the study is the ladies' parlor, and behind that, the music room. You'll see an exquisite harpsichord there that actually belonged to the Tarleton family. Upstairs, there are five bedrooms and the attic, which contained storage space and rooms for the servants. The Tarletons had five household servants who lived in the main house and a number of gardeners and grooms who lived over the carriage house, which is also preserved."<br><br>"Servants! I could use a few!" the boys' mother said, ruffling her younger son's hair.<br><br></p><h2>Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Read it and you will never think of civilization in the same way again.&#x201d;&#x2014;Kirkpatrick Sale</p><p>This anthology about "the pathology of civilization" offers insight into how progress and technology have led to emptiness and alienation.</p></p><p>Well known for his anarchist critique of technology and his work on the origins of our contemporary society in crisis, John Zerzan offers an anthology of critical commentary on civilization itself, from the Greeks to the Unabomber.Discontent with civilization has been with us all along, but is coming on now with a new freshness and insistence, as if it were a new thing. To assail civilization itself would be scandalous, but for the conclusion, occurring to more and more people, that it may be civilization that is the fundamental scandal. <p> I won't dwell here on the fact of the accelerating destruction of the biosphere. And perhaps equally obvious is the mutilation of "human nature," along with outer nature. Freud decided that the fullness of civilization would bring the zenith of universal neurosis. In this he was evidently a bit sanguine, too mild in his prognosis. It is impossible to scan a newspaper and miss the malignancy of daily life. See the multiple homicides, the 600 percent increase in teen suicide over the past thirty years; count the ways to be heavily drugged against reality; ponder what is behind the movement away from literacy. One could go on almost endlessly charting the boredom, depression, immiseration. The concept of progress has been in trouble for a few decades, but the general crisis is deepening now at a quickening pace. From this palpable extremity it is clear that something is profoundly wrong. How far back did this virus originate? How much must change for us to turn away from the cultural death march we are on? At the same time, there are some who cling to the ideal of civilization, as to a promise yet to be fulfilled. Norbert Elias, for example, declared that "civilization is never finished and always endangered." More persuasive is the sobering view of what civilization has already wrought, as in today's deadening and deadly convergence of technological processes and mass society. Richard Rubenstein found that the Holocaust "bears witness to the advance of civilization," a chilling point further developed by Zygmunt Bauman in his Modernity and the Holocaust. Bauman argued that history's most gruesome moment so far was made possible by the inner logic of civilization, which is, at bottom, division of labor. This division of labor, or specialization, works to dissolve moral accountability as it contributes to technical achievement--in this case, to the efficient, industrialized murder of millions. But isn't this too grim a picture to account for all of it? What of other aspects, like art, music, literature--are they not also the fruit of civilization? To return to Bauman and his point about Nazi genocide, Germany was after all the land of Goethe and Beethoven, arguably the most cultural or spiritual European country. Of course we try to draw strength from beautiful achievements, which often offer cultural criticism as well as aesthetic uplift. Does the presence of these pleasures and consolations make an indictment of the whole less unavoidable? Speaking of unfulfilled ideals, however, it is valid to point out that civilization is indeed "never finished and always endangered." And that is because civilization has always been imposed, and necessitates continual conquest and repression. Marx and Freud, among others, agreed on the incompatibility of humans and nature, which is to say, the necessity of triumph over nature, or work. Obviously related is Kenneth Boulding's judgment that the achievements of civilization "have been paid for at a very high cost in human degradation, suffering, inequality, and dominance." There hasn't been unanimity as to civilization's most salient characteristic. For Morgan it was writing; for Engels, state power; for Childe, the rise of cities. Renfrew nominated insulation from nature as most fundamental. But domestication stands behind all these manifestations, and not just the taming of animals and plants, but also the taming of human instincts and freedoms. Mastery, in various forms, has defined civilization and gauged human achievement. To name, to number, to time, to represent--symbolic culture is that array of masteries upon which all subsequent hierarchies and confinements rest. </p><p> Civilization is also separation from an original wholeness and grace. The poor thing we call our "human nature" was not our first nature; it is a pathological condition. All the consolations and compensations and prosthetics of an ever more technicized and barren world do not make up for the emptiness. As Hilzheimer and others came to view domestications of animals as juvenilizations, so also are we made increasingly dependent and infantilized by the progress of civilization. Little wonder that myths, legends, and folklore about gardens of Eden, Golden Ages, Elysian fields, lands of Cockaigne and other primitivist paradises are a world-wide phenomenon. This universal longing for an aboriginal, unalienated state has also had its dark flip side, a remarkable continuity of apocalyptic beliefs and prophets of doom. Two sides of the same coin of a deep unhappiness with civilization. Centuries of the persistence of utopias in the literature and politics of the West have more recently been replaced by a strong dystopian current, as hope seems to be giving way to nightmare apprehensions. This shift began in earnest in the nineteenth century, when virtually every major figure--e.g. Goethe, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Melville, Thoreau, Nietzsche, Flaubert, Dostoevski--expressed doubt about the vitality and future of culture. At the time that technology was becoming a world-wide unifying force, social scientists such as Durkheim and Masaryk noted that melancholy and suicide increased precisely with the forward movement of civilization. In terms of the current intellectual domestication, postmodernism, despite a certain rhetoric of rebellion, is merely the latest extension of the modern civilizing process. For its moral cowardice as well as its zero degree of content, a horrific present is thus captured all too well. Meanwhile, Forbes magazine's 75th anniversary cover story explored "Why We Feel So Bad When We Have it so Good," and the simple graffito "I can't breathe!" captures our contemporary reality with precision. </p><p> From every camp, voices counsel that there can be no turning back from the path of progress, the unfolding of still more high-tech consumerist desolation. How hollow they sound, as we consider what has been lost and what may yet, one desperately hopes, be recovered.</p></p><h2>Manual of Christian Doctrine</h2><p>This concise introduction to the systematized body of Christian doctrine is presented in clear and simple language, which makes it suitable for high school and college students as well as adult study groups.

"Brooklyn Wainwright."<br><br>The young woman gave an absent nod and began to skim the thick stack of envelopes standing upright in the box in front of her. Not exactly the friendliest greeting, but the crowd was huge and the woman was probably feeling overwhelmed. Halfway through the stack, she stopped suddenly and gaped up at me. "Wait. You're Brooklyn Wainwright? Wow. I signed up for your workshop."<br><br>"Oh." I smiled. "I hope you'll enjoy it."<br><br>"I know it'll be fantastic," she said brightly. "I'm, like, your biggest fan."<br><br>"That's so nice." I peered at her badge to catch her name. "Thanks, Lucy."<br><br>For the fifth year in a row, I had been asked to present the bookbinding workshop for the annual National Librarians Association conference. It was a real honor to be asked because there had to be hundreds of talented bookbinders among the librarians who attended every year. I was doubly thrilled that the conference was being held in San Francisco this year so I wouldn't have to lug all of my supplies and equipment halfway across the country.<br><br>Sighing inwardly, I admitted that I would've been looking forward to the workshop a lot more if I hadn't botched up my schedule so badly. But nobody here needed to know that.<br><br>Lucy flipped her pink-streaked hair away from her face and continued to stare at me as though I were a rock star. Her former boredom had turned into wide-eyed excitement. It was fun, but also a little intimidating. She knew me and my work. What if she hated the workshop?<br><br>"I saw your Alice in Wonderland pop-up display at the Covington Library," she said. "It was amazing."<br><br>"Thank you." I sensed the people in line behind me getting antsy to move things along. I turned and flashed an apologetic smile.<br><br>But my new biggest fan didn't seem to notice the impatient crowd. Instead, she leaned forward and whispered loudly, "Everyone says you're going to dish about the murders during the workshop. I'm so psyched!"<br><br>"Uh . . . what?"<br><br>She nodded eagerly. "Is it true you found a body inside the Covington? What a rush!"<br><br>"Umm, no, I . . ." I had no words. The fact was, I had found a body inside the Covington. More than once, to be honest. But I wasn't about to discuss the details with a stranger.<br><br>She frowned at me, clearly confused by my reticence. Then she began to nod slowly as if she and I were in on a secret together. "Ah, I get it. You're saving the gory details for the workshop. I understand. Don't worry. I can wait."<br><br>Snapping back into work mode, she pulled a manila envelope from the stack and handed it to me. "Here you go. This envelope contains your badge and your program book. It's got all the events listed, as well as the speakers' bios. And there's a map of the convention center inside the back cover. This place is huge, so we don't want anyone to get lost." She pointed toward the opposite side of the massive hall. "You can pick up a book bag at the south end of the auditorium."<br><br>"Okay. Thanks, Lucy."<br><br>"Enjoy the conference, Brooklyn." She gave me a conspiratorial wink. "See you at the workshop."<br><br>"You bet." A little dazed and a touch breathless, I stepped away from the registration table feeling like I'd just run a sprint. Pulling my rolling briefcase behind me, I began the long trek across the crowded room.<br><br>An enormous woman in pink bumped into me and kept walking, obviously in a hurry to get her conference bag. My head was so filled with questions, I hardly noticed.<br><br>Was someone spreading the word that I would be talking about murder? Seriously? I didn't even like thinking about the bodies I'd stumbled across, let alone using them as filler in my workshop program. It wasn't going to happen. Which meant that there were going to be some disappointed people-like Lucy, for instance. I sighed and shook my head. The conference had just gotten more complicated.<br><br>I'm a bookbinder specializing in rare book restoration, which means I make my living refurbishing old books. I also enjoy creating handmade books when I'm feeling particularly artistic. Unfortunately, in connection with my work, I happened to have stumbled across more than a few dead bodies over the past several years. And yes, the victims were all connected to the various books I had been working on at the time.<br><br>But that didn't mean I was an expert on the subject of murder! I absolutely refused to draw attention to myself or to these crimes simply because of my weird proclivity for finding dead people. Why would anyone think I would take time out of a bookbinding class to talk about murder?<br><br>When it came to any connection between rare books and murder, the only bit of information I was willing to offer was this: If you thought that books weren't worth killing for, you were dead wrong.<br><br>I scanned the enormous hall, noting that in the time it had taken me to register, hundreds more people had arrived for the conference. Dozens were waiting in line to register. Some peered around anxiously, trying to get their bearings. Others were gathered in small groups chatting and laughing and, in the case of the cluster of five women closest to me, shrieking.<br><br>I did a quick mental calculation as I studied the diverse crowd. There had to be at least eight hundred people milling around this cavernous space. Probably closer to a thousand. No wonder the noise level was deafening.<br><br>The racket didn't bother me. These were my people. Librarians. Book nerds. "And apparently a few murder fans," I muttered to myself.<br><br>I headed toward the south end of the convention center, asking myself all the way: Did I really need a book bag?<br><br>More importantly, did I really need to be here at all?<br><br>The organizers had called me months ago to ask if I would give a bookbinding workshop during the conference. I had said yes because I loved giving that workshop and it was a real thrill to be asked. Then somewhere along the way they had also roped me into giving a speech on book conservation. And if that wasn't enough, I had also agreed to donate a raffle prize. I was all for fundraising for librarians, but I had to ask myself why I couldn't have simply given a basket of books or a gift card. No, I had offered to take twenty lucky librarians on a three-hour "Book Lovers' Tour" of San Francisco. We were renting a bus and everything. Good grief. What had I been thinking?<br><br>Of course, all those months ago, I had never dreamed that I would be getting married to Derek Stone this weekend.<br><br>My gaze softened and I sighed happily at the thought of marriage to Derek-and almost crashed into a gray-haired man minding his own business reading the program booklet.<br><br>"Sorry," I stammered, and kept walking. It wasn't the first time I'd spaced out and almost injured someone lately. Whenever I thought of Derek and our upcoming wedding, I sort of lost consciousness for a few seconds.<br><br>I had considered cancelling my conference events this week, but after talking it over with Derek, we decided that it would be a good idea for me to keep to my original conference schedule. Because amazingly, every last detail of the wedding was taken care of. And Derek had pointed out that attending the conference would-hopefully-distract me from any pre-wedding jitters I might be susceptible to. He had a good argument there, seeing as how I was more than a little overwhelmed by the fact that his entire family-including his parents, four brothers and their spouses and children, and various aunts and uncles-had arrived from England several days ago. They had gone directly to Sonoma to visit my family so I wouldn't see most of them until the day of the rehearsal dinner. But still.<br><br>Derek had insisted that his family would be fine in the wine country without us and that my family would provide them with plenty of fun and friendship. It all sounded good in theory. But now that I was here, staring at this massive convention space and all of these people, I began to wonder if there wasn't something I should've been doing to welcome his family more personally. And what about the rest of the wedding preparations? Had I really completed everything on my list of bridal duties? I checked my watch. Would it be wrong to leave the conference after I'd just arrived?<br><br>Not just wrong, but stupid, I silently lectured myself as I made my way through the crowd toward the book bag counter. Attending this conference would be great for my business, my career, I reminded myself. I would make new contacts, possibly acquire some new clients, and reacquaint myself with old friends.<br><br>So I was here to stay. At least for a few hours. As I wound my way through the crowd, I realized that despite my neurotic compulsion to check all of my wedding lists on an hourly basis, I was happy to be here. I had always enjoyed this conference and I was grateful to the organization for all the good things I'd received by being a part of it. Besides, being among all these librarians made me feel nostalgic for my post-graduate years. Those were good times.<br><br>Even though I had never planned to work as a librarian, I knew that starting out with a degree in library science was one of the best routes to a career as a bookbinder. Consequently, everyone I knew in school had been working feverishly toward their master of library science degree back then. I had to admit it had been daunting to be surrounded by all of those highly intelligent, compulsively organized, overwhelmingly detail-oriented people. I used to cope by wearing T-shirts that said things like: How many times have you washed your hands today? and Do you spell anal retentive with a hyphen?<br><br>Instead of the quick laugh I always expected when I showed up wearing one of my dumb T-shirts, my gifted friends would actually spend an hour or two seriously discussing whatever statement I was displaying.<br><br>"It's simple really. You spell it with a hyphen when it's used as a descriptive. For instance, if you said, 'I hate my anal-retentive professor,' that would require a hyphen. But if you said 'I'm feeling rather anal retentive today,' no hyphen is necessary."<br><br>I chuckled at the memory. God, I missed them!<br><br>I finally snagged my book bag, a sporty navy blue backpack that everyone around me agreed was highly impressive. Especially compared to last year's offering, a cheap beige fiber tote that barely held up for the length of the event. Free conference bags-and free books-were an important part of the conference experience and clearly a contentious issue.<br><br>I tested the weight of the book-laden backpack and then slipped my arms through the straps. I decided to head for the coffee kiosk, when I heard someone call my name.<br><br>"Brooklyn? Is that you?"<br><br>I whirled around and frowned at the red-haired woman standing a few feet away. "Yes?"<br><br>She laughed and ruffled her short red hair self-consciously. "I know it's been years and I've changed a few things, but I don't look that different, do I?"<br><br>I blinked. "Oh my God. Heather? Heather Babcock?"<br><br>"Yes!" She squealed and grabbed me in a crushing hug. "I was so afraid I wouldn't find you!"<br><br>"I was just thinking about you," I said. It was the absolute truth. She had been one of my favorite people back in the day. "I didn't realize you were coming. Why didn't you call me?"<br><br>"I didn't know I was coming until two days ago and then it was like a whirlwind trying to get ready for the trip."<br><br>"Wow. I'm stunned. But it's a good feeling," I added quickly, grinning to hide the fact that I was in complete shock. Heather had been one of my roommates in graduate school and a best pal from the good old days. She was so beautiful and petite, with a delicate bone structure and short-short hair. She always looked like an adorable pixie to me, but today she looked almost . . . haggard. Like maybe she hadn't slept in a week. "Gosh, it's been . . . how many years?"<br><br>"Ten, maybe? You look fantastic."<br><br>"So do you." It had been twelve years, but who was counting?<br><br>"Yeah, right." She chuckled ruefully. "I do own mirrors, let's not get carried away."<br><br>"Don't be silly, you're beautiful," I insisted, but quickly changed the subject. "Do you have time for a cup of coffee?"<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>I bought two caf&#x17d; lattes and two biscotti and we found a small table in the far corner. Within seconds we were talking and laughing like the old friends we had been, as if twelve long years hadn't passed since we'd last seen each other.<br><br>Heather and I, along with our best friend, Sara Martin, had been roommates back in library school. We had clicked from the get-go and became so inseparable that our classmates took to calling us the Three Musketeers. Sadly, though, a few weeks before graduation, Sara and Heather had a major falling-out when Heather found out that her boyfriend, Roderick, had been cheating on her-with Sara.<br><br>Heather had been inconsolable, especially when news filtered back that Sara and Rod had run off to get married. About a year later, I heard through the grapevine that Sara had caught Rod cheating on her. This was not a big surprise to anyone since Rod was adorable, but very shallow and prone to believing his own hyped-up PR. But in the end, Sara forgave him and they were still together, as far as I knew.<br><br>Heather and I avoided the dreaded subject of Sara and Roderick. Instead, Heather talked about her fulfilling job at the local library in her small town, and I told her all about my adventures in bookbinding and my relationship with Derek. I didn't mention the wedding, worried that my happiness would make her feel even worse. After thirty minutes of chatting and catching up, we both sat back and smiled.<br><br>"It's really good to see you," I said wistfully.<br><br>"You, too." Heather's smile turned enigmatic. "So, are we ever going to mention the big fat bitchy elephant in the room?"<br><br>I reached across the table and grabbed her hand. "I didn't want to ask."<br><br>She raised an eyebrow. "But you're dying to know."<br><br>"Sorry," I said, wincing. "But yeah, I would love to know if you've had any news or run-ins with . . ."</p><h2>Leaving Lavender Tides: A Lavender Tides Novella</h2><p><p><em>Shauna and Zach&#x2019;s dream honeymoon&#x2014;turned nightmare.</em></p><p>Having narrowly avoided tragedy in their hometown of Lavender Tides, Washington, Shauna and Zach Bannister are finally on a honeymoon cruise through the Hawaiian islands.

She makes her home in Southern California, where she shares a cozy, cluttered bungalow with her husband, their two children, and a dog.<b><br>Chapter One</b><br><br><i><b>London, June 1817</b></i><br><br><i>Blackberry glaze.<br></i><br>Biting the inside of her cheek, Amelia d&#x2019;Orsay suppressed a small cry of jubilation. Even at a rout like this one, a well-bred lady&#x2019;s abrupt shout of joy was likely to draw notice, and Amelia did not care to explain herself to the crush of young ladies surrounding her. Especially when the reason for her delight was not a triumph at the card table or a proposal of marriage, but rather the completion of a dinner menu.<br><br>She could imagine it now. &#x201c;Oh, Lady Amelia,&#x201d; one of these young misses would say, &#x201c;only you could think of food at a time like this.&#x201d;<br><br>Well, it wasn&#x2019;t as though Amelia had <i>planned</i> to stand in a ballroom, dreaming of menus for their family summer holiday. But she&#x2019;d been puzzling for weeks over a new sauce for braised pheasant, to replace the same old applejack reduction. Something sweet, yet tart; surprising, yet familiar; inventive, yet frugal. At last, the answer had come to her. Blackberry glaze. Strained, of course. Ooh, perhaps mulled with cloves.<br><br>Resolving to enter it in her menu book later, she swept the imaginary dish aside and compressed her grin to a half-smile. Summer at Briarbank would now officially be perfect.<br><br>Mrs. Bunscombe brushed past in a flounce of scarlet silk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s half-eleven,&#x201d; the hostess sang. &#x201c;Nearly midnight.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Nearly midnight.</i> Now there was a thought to quell her exuberance.<br><br>A cherub-faced debutante swaddled in tulle grasped Amelia by the wrist. &#x201c;Any moment now. How can you remain so calm? If he chooses me tonight, I just know I&#x2019;ll swoon.&#x201d;<br><br>Amelia sighed. And so it began. As it did at every ball, when half-eleven ticked past.<br><br>&#x201c;You needn&#x2019;t worry about making conversation,&#x201d; a young lady dressed in green satin said. &#x201c;He scarcely utters so much as a word.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are we even certain he speaks English? Wasn&#x2019;t he raised in Abyssinia or . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no. Lower Canada. Of course he speaks English. My brother plays cards with him.&#x201d; The second girl lowered her voice. &#x201c;But there is something rather <i>primitive</i> about him, don&#x2019;t you think? I think it&#x2019;s the way he moves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s the gossip you&#x2019;re heeding,&#x201d; Amelia said sensibly.<br><br>&#x201c;He waltzes like a dream,&#x201d; a third girl put in. &#x201c;When I danced with him, my feet scarcely skimmed the floor. And he&#x2019;s ever so handsome up close.&#x201d;<br><br>Amelia gave her a patient smile. &#x201c;Indeed?&#x201d;<br><br>At the opening of the season, the reclusive and obscenely wealthy Duke of Morland had finally entered society. A few weeks later, he had all London dancing to his tune. The duke arrived at every ball at the stroke of midnight. He selected a single partner from among the available ladies. At the conclusion of one set, he would escort the lady in to supper, and then . . . disappear.<br><br>Before two weeks were out, the papers had dubbed him &#x201c;the Duke of Midnight,&#x201d; and every hostess in London was jostling to invite His Grace to a ball. Unmarried ladies would not dream of promising the supper set to any other partner, for fear of missing their chance at a duke. To amplify the dramatic effect, hostesses positioned timepieces in full view and instructed orchestras to begin the set at the very hour of twelve. And it went without saying, the set concluded with a slow, romantic waltz.<br><br>The nightly spectacle held the entire <i>ton</i> in delicious, knuckle-gnawing thrall. At every ball, the atmosphere thickened with perfume and speculation as the hour of twelve approached. It was like watching medieval knights attempting to wrest Excalibur from the stone. Surely one of these evenings, the gossips declared, some blushing ing�nue would get a proper grip on the recalcitrant bachelor . . . and a legend would be born.<br><br>Legend indeed. There was no end of stories about him. Where a man of his rank and fortune was involved, there were always stories.<br><br>&#x201c;I hear he was raised barefoot and heathen in the Canadian wilderness,&#x201d; said the first girl.<br><br>&#x201c;I hear he was barely civilized when his uncle took him in,&#x201d; said the second. &#x201c;And his wild behavior gave the old duke an apoplexy.&#x201d;<br><br>The lady in green murmured, &#x201c;My brother told me there was an <i>incident</i>, at Eton. Some sort of scrape or brawl . . . I don&#x2019;t know precisely. But a boy nearly died, and Morland was expelled for it. If they sent down a duke&#x2019;s heir, you know it must have been dreadful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll not believe what I&#x2019;ve heard,&#x201d; Amelia said, widening her eyes. The ladies perked, leaning in close. &#x201c;I hear,&#x201d; she whispered, &#x201c;that by the light of the full moon, His Grace transforms into a ravening hedgehog.&#x201d;<br><br>When her companions finished laughing, she said aloud, &#x201c;Really, I can&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;s so interesting as to merit this much attention.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t say that if <i>you&#x2019;d </i>danced with him.&#x201d;<br><br>Amelia shook her head. She had watched this scene unfold time and again over the past few weeks, admittedly with amusement. But she never expected&#x2014;or desired&#x2014;to be at the center of it. It wasn&#x2019;t sour grapes, truly it wasn&#x2019;t. What other ladies saw as intriguing and romantic, she took for self-indulgent melodrama. Really, an unmarried, wealthy, handsome duke who felt the need to command <i>more</i> female attention? He must be the most vain, insufferable sort of man. <br><br>And the ladies of his choosing&#x2014;all flouncy, insipid girls in their first or second seasons. All petite, all pretty. None of them anything like Amelia.<br><br>Oh, perhaps there was a hint of bitterness to it, after all.<br><br>Really, when a lady dangled on the outer cusp of marital eligibility, as she did, society ought to allow her a quiet, unannounced slide into spinsterhood. It rather galled her, to feel several years&#x2019; worth of rejection revisited upon her night after night, as the infamous duke entered at the stroke of midnight, and at twelve-oh-one his eyes slid straight past her to some primping chit with more beauty than brains.<br><br>Not that he had reason to notice her. Her dowry barely scraped the floorboards of the &#x201c;respectable&#x201d; range, and even in her first season, she&#x2019;d never been a great beauty. Her eyes were a trifle too pale, and she blushed much too easily. And at the age of six-and-twenty, she&#x2019;d come to accept that she would always be a little too plump.<br><br>The girls suddenly scattered, like the flighty things they were.<br><br>A deep whisper came from behind her shoulder. &#x201c;You look ravishing, Amelia.&#x201d;<br><br>Sighing, she wheeled to face the speaker. &#x201c;Jack. What is it you&#x2019;re after?&#x201d;<br><br>Pressing a hand to his lapel, he pulled an offended expression. &#x201c;Must I be after something? Can&#x2019;t a fellow pay his dearest sister a compliment without falling under suspicion?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not when the fellow in question is you. And it&#x2019;s no compliment to be called your dearest sister. I&#x2019;m your only sister. If you&#x2019;re after my purse, you must come up with something better than that.&#x201d; She spoke in a light, teasing tone, hoping against all previous evidence that he would protest: <i>No, Amelia. This time, I&#x2019;m not after your purse. I&#x2019;ve ceased gambling and drinking, and I&#x2019;ve thrown over those ne&#x2019;er-do-well &#x201c;friends&#x201d; of mine. I&#x2019;m returning to University. I&#x2019;ll take orders in the Church, just as I promised our dying mother. And you truly do look lovely tonight.<br></i><br>Eyes flicking toward the crowd, he lowered his voice. &#x201c;A few bob. That&#x2019;s all I need.&#x201d;<br><br>Her chest deflated. Not even midnight, and already his eyes held that wild, liquor-flared spark that indicated he was on the verge of doing something spectacularly ill-conceived.<br><br>Steering him by the elbow, she left the young ladies to titter amongst themselves and guided her brother through the nearest set of doors. They stepped into the crescent of yellow light shining through the transom window. The night air closed around them, cloying and humid.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anything,&#x201d; she lied.<br><br>&#x201c;A few shillings for the hack, Amelia.&#x201d; He grabbed for the reticule dangling from her wrist. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re off to the theater, a gang of us.&#x201d;<br><br>Off to the theater, her eye. Off to the gaming hells, more likely. She clutched the beaded drawstring pouch to her bosom. &#x201c;And how will I get home, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, Morland will take you.&#x201d; He winked. &#x201c;Right after your dance. I&#x2019;ve two pounds sterling on you tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>Wonderful. Another two pounds she&#x2019;d have to siphon from her pin money. &#x201c;At tremendously long odds, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t speak like that.&#x201d; A touch grazed her arm. Jack&#x2019;s expression was suddenly, unexpectedly sincere. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d be damned lucky to have you, Amelia. There&#x2019;s no lady your equal in that room.&#x201d;<br><br>Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. Since their brother Hugh&#x2019;s death at Waterloo, Jack had changed, and not for the better. But in rare flashes, that dear, sensitive brother she loved would surface. She wanted so desperately to gather him close and hold tight to him for weeks, months . . . however long it took, to coax the old Jack out from this brittle shell.<br><br>&#x201c;Come now. Be a sweet sister, and lend me a crown or two. I&#x2019;ll send a runner to Laurent&#x2019;s, and he&#x2019;ll send that garish new landau for you. You&#x2019;ll be driven home in the finest style his copper heiress can afford.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her name is Winifred. She&#x2019;s the Countess of Beauvale now, and you ought to speak of her with respect. It&#x2019;s her fortune that purchased Michael&#x2019;s commission and supports young William at school. It&#x2019;s thanks to her and Laurent that I even have a home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m the worthless ingrate who brings the family nothing but disgrace. I know, I know.&#x201d; His flinty gaze clashed with a forced smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s worth a few coins to be rid of me, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you understand? I don&#x2019;t want to be rid of you at all. I love you, you fool.&#x201d; She smoothed that incorrigible wisp of hair that always curled at his left temple. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t you let me help you, Jack?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. If you&#x2019;ll start with a shilling or two.&#x201d;<br><br>With clumsy fingers, she loosened the strings of her reticule. &#x201c;I will give you everything I have, on one condition.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must promise me you&#x2019;ll join us this summer, at Briarbank.&#x201d;<br><br>The d&#x2019;Orsays always summered at Briarbank&#x2014;a rambling stone cottage overlooking the River Wye, down the slope from the ruins of Beauvale Castle. Amelia had been planning this summer&#x2019;s holiday for months, down to the last damask tablecloth and saucer of currant jelly. Briarbank was the answer to everything, she knew it. It had to be.<br><br>Hugh&#x2019;s death had devastated the entire family, but Jack most of all. Of all her brothers, the two of them had been the fastest friends. Hugh had been just one year older, but several years wiser, and his serious bent had always balanced Jack&#x2019;s wilder personality. Without that check on his impulsive nature, Amelia feared Jack&#x2019;s grief and recklessness were conspiring to disaster.<br><br>What he needed was love, and time to heal. Time spent far from Town, and close to home and family&#x2014;what remained of both. Here in London, Jack was surrounded by temptation, constantly pressured to keep pace with his spendthrift peers. At Briarbank, he would surely return to his good-humored self. Young William would come on his break from school. Michael would still be at sea, of course, but Laurent and Winifred would join them, at least for a week or two.<br><br>And Amelia would be the perfect hostess. Just as Mama had always been. She would fill every room with great vases of snapdragons, arrange theatricals and parlor games, serve braised pheasant with blackberry glaze.<br><br>She would make everyone happy, by sheer force of will. Or bribery, if she must.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve a crown and three shillings here,&#x201d; she said, extracting the coins from the pouch, &#x201c;and six pounds more saved at home.&#x201d; Saved, scrimped, scraped together, one penny at a time. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s yours, all of it&#x2014;but you must promise me August at Briarbank.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack tsked. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t tell you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who? Who didn&#x2019;t tell me what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Laurent. We&#x2019;re not opening the cottage this summer. It was just settled this week. We&#x2019;re letting it out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Letting it out?&#x201d; Amelia felt as though all the blood had been let from her veins. Suddenly dizzy, she clutched her brother&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Briarbank, let out? To strangers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, not to strangers.We&#x2019;ve put the word around at the clubs and expect inquiries from several good families. It&#x2019;s a plum holiday cottage, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she bit out. &#x201c;Yes, I do know. It&#x2019;s so ideal, the d&#x2019;Orsay family has summered there for centuries. <i>Centuries</i>, Jack. Why would we dream of leasing it out?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t we outgrown the pall-mall and tea biscuits routine? It&#x2019;s dull as tombs out there. Halfway to Ireland,&nbsp;for God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dull? What on earth can you mean? You used to live for summers there, angling on the river and&#x2014;&#x201d; Comprehension struck, numbing her to the toes. &#x201c;Oh, no.&#x201d; She dug her fingers into his arm. &#x201c;How much did you lose? How much do you owe?&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes told her he&#x2019;d resigned all pretense. &#x201c;Four hundred pounds.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Four hundred! To whom?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To Morland.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Duke of Midni&#x2014;&#x201d; Amelia bit off the absurd nickname. She refused to puff the man&#x2019;s notoriety further. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s not even arrived yet. How did you manage to lose four hundred pounds to him, when he&#x2019;s not even here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not tonight. Days ago now. That&#x2019;s why I must leave. He&#x2019;ll be here any moment, and I can&#x2019;t face him until I&#x2019;ve made good on the debt.&#x201d;<br><br>Amelia could only stare at him.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look at me like that, I can&#x2019;t bear it. I was holding my own until Faraday put his token in play. That&#x2019;s what brought Morland to the table, drove the betting sky-high. He&#x2019;s out to gather all ten, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All ten of what? All ten <i>tokens</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course. The tokens are everything.&#x201d; Jack made an expansive gesture. &#x201c;Come now, you can&#x2019;t be so out of circulation as <i>that</i>. It&#x2019;s only the most elite gentlemen&#x2019;s club in London.&#x201d;<br><br>When she only blinked at him, he prompted, &#x201c;Harcliffe. Osiris. One stud horse, ten brass tokens. You&#x2019;ve heard of the club, I know you have.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;ve no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about. You seem to be telling me you&#x2019;ve wagered our ancestral home against a brass token. And lost.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was in for hundreds already; I couldn&#x2019;t back down. And my cards . . . Amelia, I swear to you, they were unbeatable cards.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Except that they weren&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>He gave a fatalistic shrug. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s done is done. If I had some other means of raising the funds, I would. I&#x2019;m sorry you&#x2019;re disappointed, but there&#x2019;s always next year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but&#x2014;&#x201d; But next year was a whole year away. God only knew what trouble would find Jack in the meantime. &#x201c;There must be another way. Ask Laurent for the money.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know he can&#x2019;t give it.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course he was right. Their eldest brother had married prudently, almost sacrificially. The family had been desperate for funds at the time, and Winifred had come with bags of money from her mining-magnate father. The trouble was, the bags of money came cinched tightly with strings, and only Laurent&#x2019;s father-in-law could loosen them. The old man would never authorize the use of four hundred pounds to pay off a gaming debt.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to leave before Morland arrives,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You understand.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack unlooped the reticule from her limp wrist, and she did not fight him as he shook the coins into his palm. Yes, she understood. Even if nothing remained of their fortune, the d&#x2019;Orsays would cling to their pride.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you at least learned your lesson now?&#x201d; she said quietly.<br><br>He vaulted the low terrace rail. Rattling the coins in his palm, he backed away into the garden. &#x201c;You know me, Amelia. I never was any good with lessons. I just copied my slate from Hugh&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>As she watched her br...</p><h2>Organization Theory &amp; Design</h2><p>Discover the most progressive thinking about organizations today as acclaimed author Richard Daft balances recent, innovative ideas with proven classic theories and effective business practices.

His many prestigious Nordic crime-writing awards include the Glass Key Award, also won by Henning Mankell, Jo Nesb�, Stieg Larsson, and Peter H�eg.<b>Prologue</b><br><br>It was the third morning, and the smell of tar and seaweed had got into his clothes. Under the boathouse floor, the mush of ice lapped soundlessly against the wooden stilts and awakened memories of days when everything had been all right.<br><br>He lifted his upper body from the bedding of waste paper and pulled himself sufficiently upright as to be able to make out his younger brother&#x2019;s face, which even in sleep seemed tormented, chilled to the bone.<br><br>Soon, he would wake and glance around in panic. He would feel the leather straps tight around his wrists and waist and hear the jangle of the chain that constrained him. He would see the snowstorm and the light as it struggled to penetrate the tarred timber planks. And then he would start to pray.<br><br>Countless were the times desperation had sprung forth in his brother&#x2019;s eyes. Through the heavy-duty tape that covered his mouth came the repeated sound of his muffled pleas that Jehovah have mercy upon them.<br><br>Yet both of them knew that Jehovah no longer paid heed, for blood had passed their lips. Blood that their jailer had let drip into their cups. The cups from which he had allowed them to drink before revealing to them what they had contained. They had drunk water, but in the water was blood, so forbidden, and now they were damned for ever. And for that reason, shame pierced deeper even than thirst.<br><br><i>What do you think he&#x2019;ll do to us?</i> his brother&#x2019;s frightened eyes seemed so incessantly to ask. But how could he ever know the answer? All he knew was that he had an instinctive feeling that it would all soon be over.<br><br>He leaned backwards and scanned the room once again in the dim light, allowing his gaze to pass across the collar beams and through the formations of cobwebs, noting each and every projection, each and every knot. The worn paddles and oars that hung from the apex of the ceiling. The rotten fishing nets that had long since made their last catch.<br><br>And then he discovered the bottle. A gleam of sunlight played momentarily on the blue-white glass to dazzle him.<br><br>So near, and yet so hard to reach. It was just behind him, wedged between the thick, rough-hewn planks of the floor.<br><br>He stuck his fingers through the gap and tried to prise the bottle upwards by the neck, but the air froze upon his skin. When the thing came loose, he would smash it and use the shards to cut through the strap that kept his hands tied tight together behind his back. And when it succumbed, his numb fingers would find the buckle at his spine. He would loosen it, tear the tape from his mouth, remove the straps from around his waist and thighs, and as soon as the chain that was fastened to the leather strap at his waist no longer held him back, he would lunge forward and free his brother. He would draw him towards him and hold him tight until their bodies ceased to tremble.<br><br>Then, he imagined, he would use all his strength to gouge into the timber around the door with the broken glass. He would see if he could hollow out the planks on which the hinges were placed. And if the worst should happen and the car came before he was finished, he would lie in wait for the man. He would stand poised behind the door with the broken glass in his hand. That was what he told himself he would do.<br><br>He leaned forward, folded his freezing fingers behind his back and prayed for forgiveness for his wicked thought.<br><br>Then he scraped again in the space between the planks to try to free the bottle. He scraped and scratched until the neck angled enough for him to grab hold of it.<br><br>He listened.<br><br>Was that an engine? Yes, it was. The powerful engine of a large car. But was it approaching or simply passing by in the distance out there?<br><br>For a moment, the low, deep sound seemed to get louder. He began to pull so desperately at the neck of the bottle that his knuckles cracked audibly. But then the sound died away. Had it been the wind turbines, rumbling and whirring? Maybe it was something else entirely. He had no idea.<br><br>He expelled warm breath from his nostrils. It steamed the air around his face. He wasn&#x2019;t so afraid any more, not now. As long as he thought about the grace of Jehovah, he felt better.<br><br>He pressed his lips together and laboured on. And when finally the bottle came free, he struck it so hard against the timber of the floor that his brother lifted his head with a startled jolt and looked around in terror.<br><br>Again and again, he brought the bottle down against the floor. It was hard to get purchase with his hands behind his back. Too hard. Eventually, when his fingers were no longer able to maintain their grip, he let the bottle slide from his hand, turned himself around and stared emptily at it as dust gently descended through the cramped space from the beams.<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t break it. He simply wasn&#x2019;t able. A pathetic little bottle. Was it because they had drunk blood? Had Jehovah abandoned them?<br><br>He looked at his brother, who rolled himself slowly into his blanket and fell back on to his bedding. He was silent, not even attempting to mumble a word through the tape that sealed his lips.<br>It took a while to gather the things he needed. The hardest part was stretching himself, confined by his chain, to reach the tar between the roofing planks with the tips of his fingers. Everything else was at hand: the bottle, the sharp sliver of wood from the timbered floor, the paper on which he was sitting.<br><br>He pushed off one of his shoes and stabbed so sharply at his wrist with the sliver that tears welled in his eyes. He let the blood drip on to his polished shoe for a minute, perhaps two. Then he tore a large shred of paper from his bedding, dipped the wooden fragment in his blood and twisted his body, pulling at his chain, until he was able to see what he was writing behind his back. As best he could, and in the smallest of handwriting, he put down in words what was happening to them. When he had finished, he signed the letter with his name, rolled up the paper and stuffed it inside the bottle.<br><br>He allowed himself plenty of time to press the lump of tar down into the neck. He shifted his weight so as to see better, and checked and double-checked to make sure it was well done.<br><br>When finally there was no more to do, he heard the dull sound of a car engine. This time there was no mistake. He cast a pained glance at his little brother and stretched with all his might towards the light that seeped in through a broad crack in the timbered wall, the only opening through which the bottle would be able to pass.<br><br>Then the door was opened and a thick shadow entered amid a flurry of white snow.<br><br>Silence.<br><br>And then the plop.<br><br>The bottle was released.</p><h2>Winning at New Products: Creating Value Through Innovation</h2><p><b>A fully updated edition of the classic business reference book on product development from a world renowned innovation management scholar</b><br>For more than two decades, <i>Winning at New Products</i> has served as the bible for product developers everywhere.

Barbara's book features fifty quilt blocks that commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. Each block (most were first published in the 1930s) was selected for the symbolism its name lends to recounting stories from the era's women. This compilation of quilt block patterns includes period photos and first-person accounts. Choose from pieced or appliqu�d blocks, each in two colorways with instructions for 8&#x201d; and 12&#x201d; sizes. Dig into your reproduction fabrics and enjoy combining blocks to make your own tribute quilt.</p><p>Barbara Brackman, a renowned quilt historian, has written several books about quilts during the Civil War era. She was a founding member of the American Quilt Study Group and is an honoree of the Quilters Hall of Fame. Barbara lives in Kansas.If you are a history buff like some of us here, along with quilting, Barbara Brackman introduced the Civil War Sampler: 50 Quilt Blocks with Stories from History coming out from C&amp;T. The blocks and possibilities are endless and have appear on her blog but you can get them and the history in her book. (<i>Fons &amp; Porter's Love of Quilting, 11/15/12</i>)<br><br>Each week throughout 2011, renowned quilt historian Barbara Brackman posted instructions for making a patchwork block on her blog to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the start of the American Civil War. Although the blocks were traditional, most had been published in the 1930s in newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and the Kansas City Star&#x2014;not many actually dated from the Civil War era. But Barbara uses the symbolism of the block names and words taken from the diaries and journals of the time to acknowledge the war's events and honour those who lived through them. The series became extremely popular, and Barbara was encouraged to package them, along with a few new features, in this book. She provides instructions for cutting the fabric to make both 8 in and 12 in blocks, a diagram to help you construct it, photographs of the block made in two different colourways, and a historical note that explains the significance of its name. There aren't detailed step-by-step instructions for making a quilt from all 50 blocks&#x2014;that's up to your imagination. (<i>Australian Homespun Magazine, April 2013</i>)<br><br>Here is an opportunity to learn more about the lives of Civil War women and travel through this period of American history with this special compilation of 50 quilt block patterns, combined with period photographs and first-person accounts. Choose from a variety of pieced or appliqued blocks, each shown in two colorways with instructions for assembling two sizes, 8" and 12" blocks. Look out for the display of Foxy Quilters, Barnsley, which are based on Barbara Brackman's Civil War Sampler. The quilts will be touring the quilt shows this autumn with Grosvenor Shows at Harrogate, Edinburgh, Malvern and Duxford. (<i>Fabrications Quilting For You, April/May 2013</i>)<br><br>This is another stunning book from quiltmaker and historian Barbara Brackman. The book is based on the blog she ran in 2011, publishing one quilt block a week and sharing one personal account linked to the American Civil War as 2011 was the 150th anniversary of the start of that conflict. The book contains 50 blocks and each one has a personal recount of an interesting historical piece or both, some relating to the blocks and all relating to the war. There are cutting and piecing instructions to make all of the blocks as either 8 in or 12 in and each block is shown in at least two colour variations. This is another lovely book of Barbara's to add to the collection.

Parker</b>&nbsp;was the author of seventy books, including the legendary Spenser detective series, the novels featuring police chief Jesse Stone, and the acclaimed Virgil Cole-Everett Hitch westerns, as well as the Sunny Randall novels. Winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award and long considered the undisputed dean of American crime fiction, he died in January 2010.Parker&#39;s Boston-based PI, Spenser, is hired as a bodyguard for a socialite who is hosting her daughter&#39;s wedding on her private island. When the groom is murdered and the bride is kidnapped, Spenser is determined to get to the bottom of the suspicious circumstances--especially the appearance of the Gray Man. Joe Mantegna&#39;s characterization of Spenser is as rock-steady as Spenser&#39;s integrity. Mantegna IS Spenser: determined and erudite, equally capable of killing a foe and cooking a gourmet meal. The dialogue, sometimes lacking the concise perfection that is Parker&#39;s hallmark, is rescued by Mantegna&#39;s portrayals of the characters, Spenser himself, Susan (elegantly cultured but remarkably tolerant of Spenser&#39;s life-and-death world), and Hawk (ever stalwart and loyal). Thanks to Mantegna&#39;s skill, this audiobook is better than the print publication.

She would be stranded without a home, without shelter, in a town where the two people she cared most about in the world were both gone.<br><br>The lateness of the hour and her own exhaustion from the stress of the past week pressed in on her, macerating her control. She felt it slipping through her fingers like fine-grained sand but she forced herself to take a deep breath.<br><br><em>Okay. Calm.</em> She could handle this. She had fully expected the door to be locked. No one had lived here for months. If she had showed up on the doorstep of the old house and found it wasn't secure, <em>then</em> she would have cause to worry.<br><br>This wasn't a problem. She knew right where her great-aunt always hid the spare key&#x2014;assuming no one had changed the locks, of course....<br><br>She wasn't going to go there yet. Instead, she turned on the flashlight app of her phone and used the small glow it provided to guide her way around the corner of the wraparound porch.<br><br>The chains of the old wood porch swing clanked and rattled as she sat down, a familiar and oddly comforting sound. She reached for the armrest closest to the front door with one hand, aiming the light from her phone with the other.<br><br>After a little fumbling, her fingers found the catch and she opened the tiny, clever hidden compartment Annabelle had created herself inside the armrest.<br><br>Only someone who knew the magic secret of the porch swing could ever find the hollowed-out hiding place. She reached inside and felt around until her fingers encountered the ice-cold metal of the key to Iris House.<br><br>"Thank you, Annabelle," she murmured.<br><br>She discovered that no one had changed the locks when she inserted the key and turned it. See, there was a bright spot. Next hurdle: What if the security code had been changed since her last visit?<br><br>Knowing she didn't have a moment to spare, she didn't take time to savor the scents of rosemary and lemon wood polish and <em>home</em> that greeted her inside.<br><br>Instead, she bolted to the keypad for the state-of-the-art security system Annabelle had installed several years ago. Her fingers fumbled on the keypad but she managed to type in the numbers that corresponded with the letters <em>H-O-P-E.</em><br><br>The system announced it was now disarmed. Only then did she let herself sigh with relief, trying not to notice how the small sound echoed through the empty space.<br><br>She flipped the light switch in the entryway, with its parquet floor and the magnificent curving staircase made up of dozens of intricately turned balusters.<br><br>How many times had she rushed into this entry-way during the two years she'd lived here during her teen years and called to Annabelle she was home before dropping her books on the bottom step to take up to her room later?<br><br>Suddenly she had an image of when she'd first arrived at fifteen, her heart angry and battered, showing up at a distant relative's home with everything she owned in bags at her feet.<br><br>Apparently, things hadn't changed that much in seventeen years&#x2014;except this time her bags were still out in the car.<br><br>She turned around, half expecting Annabelle to come bustling through the doorway from the kitchen in one of those zip-up half aprons she always wore that had a hundred pockets, arms outstretched and ready to wrap her into a soft, sweet-smelling embrace.<br><br>That familiar sense of disorienting loss gnawed through her as she remembered Annabelle wouldn't bustle through that door ever again.<br><br>She felt something dig into her palm and realized she was still clutching the key from the front porch. She slid it onto the table, making a mental note to return it to its hiding place later then took another of her cleansing breaths.<br><br>Right now she needed to focus. She desperately needed sleep and a chance to regroup and regain a little perspective.<br><br>The air inside Iris House was stale, cold. She walked through turning on lights as she headed for the thermostat outside the main-floor bedroom Annabelle had used the past few years when it became harder for her to reach the second or third floors.<br><br>The heating system thermostat was set for sixty-two degrees, probably to keep the pipes from freezing during the winter, but the actual temperature read in the mid-fifties.<br><br>She tried turning the heating system off and then on again&#x2014;about the sum total of her HVAC expertise. When no answering whoosh of warm air responded through the vents, she frowned. Annabelle used to complain the pilot light in the furnace could be tricky at times. Apparently this was one of those times.<br><br>Lucy was torn between laughter and tears. What did a girl have to do to catch a break around here? She had walked away from everything and packed up her life to come here, seeking the security and safety she had always found at Iris House.<br><br>With all the possible complications that could have ensnarled her journey here from Seattle, she had finally made it and now a stupid pilot light would be the one thing keeping her from reaching her goal of staying here.<br><br>It didn't have to be a stumbling block. Last time she counted, the old house had nine fireplaces and she had seen a pile of seasoned firewood against the garage when she pulled up. She didn't have to heat the whole house, just one room. She could pick one and spend a perfectly comfortable night in front of the fire then have a furnace technician come in the next day.<br><br>And wasn't that some kind of metaphor for her life right now? Who ever said she had to fix every disaster she had created right this moment? She only had to focus on making it through tonight then she could sort the rest of it out later.<br><br>Considering none of the beds likely had linens at all&#x2014;and certainly not fresh ones&#x2014;for tonight she would bunk on the sofa in the room Annabelle had used as a TV room, she decided, and deal with the rest of the mess in the morning.<br><br>"You can do this," she said aloud.<br><br>Hearing her own voice helped push away some of the ghosts that wandered through the house. Annabelle. Jess. Even her younger self, angry and wounded.<br><br>Energized by having a viable plan of action, she quickly headed out into the rain again and grabbed an armload of wood from the pile, enough to keep the cold at bay for several hours, at least. Trust Annabelle to keep her woodpile covered and protected so the wood was dry and ready to burn. Her great-aunt had probably cut it all herself.<br><br>Back inside, she dropped the pile of wood on the hearth in the cozy little den and found matches and kindling sticks in a canister on the mantel.<br><br>She was <em>so</em> not a Girl Scout, but Annabelle had insisted both she and Jessica learn the proper way to light a fire. Those long-ago lessons bubbled back to the surface, and in moments she had a tidy little blaze going.<br><br>Perfect. In no time, the room would be cozy and comfortable.<br><br>She added a larger split log and watched the flames dance around it for a moment before they caught hold. Already the house felt a little warmer, not quite as empty and lonely.<br><br>She yawned, tempted to curl up right this instant on the sofa and drop off. No. She would sleep better in a nightgown, with her teeth brushed and her face washed. Closing the door to the room behind her to hold on to the heat, she headed out for one more bonechilling trip to the car for the suitcase that held her essentials.<br><br>She carried the case straight to the bathroom just off the kitchen and made it through her ablutions with bleary eyes. After grabbing a couple of blankets out of the linen chest in the downstairs guest room, she opened the door to the den&#x2014;and was greeted by thick, choking black smoke.<br><br>For an instant, her exhausted brain couldn't quite process this latest disaster in a depressingly long line of them. Then in a wild burst of panic, her synapses started blasting messages, one after the other, and she had the presence of mind to slam the door shut.<br><br>Smoke. Blaze. Iris House was on fire.<br><br>"No! No, no no!"<br><br>It was probably just the chimney not drawing correctly. That's all. <em>Calm down.</em> She would just put the fire out and air out the room and all would be fine.<br><br>Fire extinguisher! Where was the bloody fire extinguisher? Annabelle always kept one under the kitchen sink, she remembered. She raced back and yanked open the cabinets then blessed her great-aunt's independent, self-reliant mindset. The fire extinguisher was attached right to the inside door.<br><br>Lucy yanked it off and quickly scanned the instructions, then stopped long enough to grab a dishcloth out of a drawer to cover her mouth before charging back to the den.<br><br>She couldn't see any flames through the smoke, which further reinforced the idea that a chimney draw issue was to blame. She hoped, anyway. At the same time, she wasn't completely stupid. If she couldn't deal with the problem on her own, she would call the fire department.<br><br>Coughing, eyes burning from the smoke, she activated the fire extinguisher and sprayed toward the logs.<br><br>The fire sizzled and spat at coming into contact with the chemical as the extinguisher did its job.<br><br>Okay. Crisis averted.<br><br>She hurried and unlatched the window to let some of the smoke out. Just as she turned around, she heard an ominous crackling and a loud, angry roar from overhead.<br><br>Her stomach turned over. She had heard that sound once before, in one of the upstairs bedrooms one memorable wintry January day when she was seventeen. This was more than a problem with a poorly drawing flue. This was a chimney fire.<br><br>In that previous fire when she was living here, that had been a case of an old bird's nest falling and igniting. This could be another one or perhaps creosote buildup had ignited.<br><br>Whatever the reason, this was a nightmare. Chimney fires burned hot and fierce and could burn through the masonry, the walls. Everything. In addition, flying debris could ignite the roof and take down the entire hundred-twenty-year-old historic mansion.<br><br>She couldn't burn down Iris House. She had nothing else left.<br><br>Though she knew it was risky, in one last desperate effort, she aimed the fire extinguisher up the chimney, adrenaline shooting through her as fast and fierce as those flames, until the chemical ran out then she scooped up her purse and raced for the door with her phone in hand, already dialing 911.<br><br>Apparently, someone beat her to it. She ran out onto the porch just as a couple of guys in full uniforms were running out of a fire truck parked behind her car, lights flashing. Another engine was just pulling up behind it.<br><br>Somebody must have seen the smoke pouring out the window and called it in. Yay for nosy neighbors.<br><br>"Is there anybody else inside?" one of the firefighters asked her.<br><br>"No. Just me. It's a chimney fire, centered in the den. Go to the end of the hall, last door on the right."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>"Oh, am I so glad to see you guys," she called to the third firefighter she encountered as she headed down the steps of the porch.<br><br>This one wasn't in turnout gear, only a coat and helmet that shielded his features in the smoke and the gloomy night. She had only an impression of height and impressive bulk before he spoke in a voice as hard and terrifying as the fire.<br><br>"You won't be so glad to see us when we have you arrested for trespassing, arson and criminal mischief."<br><br>Lucy screwed her eyes shut as recognition flooded through her.<br><br>Oh, joy.<br><br>She should have known. Brendan Caine. He was probably the reason she hadn't wanted to call the fire department in the first place. Her subconscious probably had been gearing up for this encounter since she saw that first puff of smoke.<br><br>It would have been nice if she could have spent at least an hour or two in Hope's Crossing before she had to face this man who just happened to despise her. Not the way her luck was going these days, apparently.<br><br>She lifted her chin. "How can I be trespassing in my own house, Chief Caine?"<br><br>He jerked his head up as if she had lobbed a fireball at him. In the glow from the porch light, she saw his rugged features go slack with shock. "Lucy? What the hell?"<br><br>She tried for a nonchalant shrug. "Apparently, having the chimneys cleaned is now at the top of my to-do list."<br><br>"You did this?"<br><br>"The furnace wouldn't kick on so I thought I would warm the place up with a fire"<br><br>"The pilot light has been dicey all winter. I've been meaning to have somebody in to look at it. I've had to relight it a couple times a week."<br><br>Of course. He only lived about four houses down the street&#x2014;and since Annabelle had been Jessica's great-aunt, too, Brendan would naturally feel responsible for looking after Iris House.<br><br>"I didn't know how to light it and I was freezing," she said. "I just figured I would stay warm with a fire tonight and deal with the furnace in the morning."<br><br>"And you never thought to go to a hotel?"<br><br>"Why go to a hotel when I happen to own a twenty-room mansion?"<br><br>Before he could answer, the two firefighters who had first charged into the house came out. "Chimney fire," one said. "Looks like some creosote ignited. It's mostly extinguished but we'll need to head up to the roof to put out any hot spots."<br><br>She wanted to sit right down on the porch steps and sob with relief&#x2014;but she would never do that in front of Brendan Caine, of course.<br><br>He pulled out a radio and issued instructions in it that were completely beyond her understanding, something about a ladder truck.<br><br>"I want my paramedics to take a look at you," he said to her after he finished.<br><br>"That's not necessary. I'm fine."<br><br>"It wasn't a request," he said, his tone hard. "We need to be sure your lungs are okay after breathing all that smoke."<br><br></p><h2>The Unifying Force (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 19)</h2><p><b>At long last, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series that launched the <i>Star Wars</i> saga into the next generation and into thrilling new territory reaches its spectacular finale.

He is also the author of the fantasy novel <i>Hunt for the Mayan Looking-Glass</i>, available as an eBook.&nbsp;He lives in Annapolis, Maryland, with his wife and youngest child.</p>&#x201c;Cakhmaim&#x2019;s getting to be a pretty good shot,&#x201d; Han said over the sound of the reciprocating quad laser cannon. &#x201c;Remind me to up his pay&#x2014;or at least promote him.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia glanced at him from the copilot&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;From bodyguard to<br>what&#x2014;butler?&#x201d;<br><br>Han pictured the Noghri in formal attire, setting meals in front of<br>Han and Leia in the <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s forward cabin. His upper lip curled in<br>delight, and he laughed shortly. &#x201c;Maybe we should see how he does<br>with the rest of these skips.&#x201d;<br><br>The YT-1300 was just coming out of her long turn, with Selvaris&#x2019;s<br>double suns off to starboard and an active volcano dominating the forward<br>view. Below, green-capped, sheer-sided islands reached up into<br>the planet&#x2019;s deep blue sky, and the aquamarine sea seemed to go on<br>forever. Two coralskippers were still glued to the <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s tail, chopping<br>at it and holding position through all the insane turns and evasions,<br>but so far the deflector shields were holding.<br><br>His large hands gripped on the control yoke, Han glanced at the<br>console&#x2019;s locator display, where only one bezel was pulsing.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d the other swoop go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We lost it,&#x201d; Leia said.<br><br>Han leaned toward the viewport to survey the undulating sea.<br>&#x201c;How could we lose&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I mean it&#x2019;s gone. One of the coralskippers took it out.&#x201d;<br><br>Han&#x2019;s eyes blazed. &#x201c;Why, that&#x2014;which one of &#x2019;em?&#x201d;<br><br>Before Leia could answer, two plasma missiles streaked past the<br>cockpit, bright as meteors and barely missing the starboard mandible.<br><br>&#x201c;Does it matter?&#x201d;<br><br>Han shook his head. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the other swoop?&#x201d;<br><br>Leia studied the locator display, then called up a map from the<br>terrain sensor, which showed everything from the mouth of the<br>estuary clear to the volcano. Her left forefinger tapped the screen.<br>&#x201c;Far side of that island.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any skips after it?&#x201d;<br>A loud explosion buffeted the <i>Falcon </i>from behind.<br><br>&#x201c;We seem to be the popular target,&#x201d; Leia said. &#x201c;Just the way you<br>like it.&#x201d;<br><br>Han narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;You bet I do.&#x201d;<br><br>Determined to lure their pair of pursuers away from the swoop, he<br>threw the freighter into a sudden ascent. When they had climbed<br>halfway to the stars, he dropped the ship into a stomach-churning<br>corkscrew. Pulling out sharply, he twisted the ship through a looping<br>rollover, emerging from the combo headed in the opposite direction,<br>with the two coralskippers in front of him.<br><br>He grinned at Leia. &#x201c;Now who&#x2019;s in charge?&#x201d;<br><br>She blew out her breath. &#x201c;Was there ever any doubt?&#x201d;<br><br>Han focused his attention on the two enemy craft. Over the long<br>years, Yuuzhan Vong pilots faced with impossible odds had surrendered<br>some of the suicidal resolve they had displayed during the early<br>days of the war. Maybe word had come down from Supreme Overlord<br>Shimrra or someone that discretion really was the better part of valor.<br>Whatever the case, the pilots of the two skips Han was stalkling apparently<br>saw some advantage to fleeing rather than reengaging the ship<br>their plasma missiles had failed to bring down. But Han wasn&#x2019;t content<br>to send them home with their tails tucked between their legs&#x2014;<br>especially not after they had killed an unarmed swoop pilot he had<br>come halfway across the galaxy to rescue.<br><br>&#x201c;Cakhmaim, listen up,&#x201d; he said into his headset mike. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fire the<br>belly gun from here. We&#x2019;ll put &#x2019;em in the Money Lane and be done<br>with them.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Money Lane </i>was Han&#x2019;s term for the area where the quad lasers&#x2019;<br>firing fields overlapped. In emergency situations, both cannons could<br>be fired from the cockpit, but the present situation didn&#x2019;t call for that.<br>What&#x2019;s more, Han wanted to give Cakhmaim the chance to hone his<br>firing technique. All Han and Leia had to do was help line up the<br>shots.<br><br>From the way the coralskippers reacted to the <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s sudden<br>turnabout, Han could almost believe that the enemy pilots had been<br>eavesdropping on his communication with the Noghri. The first<br>skip&#x2014;the more battered of the pair, showing charred blotches and<br>deep pockmarks&#x2014;poured on all speed, separating from his wingmate<br>at a sharp angle. Smaller and faster, and seemingly helmed by a better<br>pilot, the second skip shed velocity in an attempt to trick the <i>Falcon<br></i>into coming across his vector.<br><br>That was the skip that had taken out the swoop, Han decided,<br>sentencing the pilot to be the first to feel the <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s wrath.<br><br>Leia guessed as much, and immediately plotted an intercept<br>course.<br><br>Exposed, the skip pilot went evasive, moving into the gunsights<br>and out again, but with mounting panic as the <i>Falcon </i>settled calmly<br><br>into kill position. The dorsal laser cannon was programmed to fire<br>three-beam bursts that, all these years later, still had the ability to<br>outwit the dovin basals of the older, perhaps more dim-witted coralskippers.<br>While the enemy craft was quick to deploy a gravitic anomaly<br>that engulfed the first and second beams, the third got through,<br>blowing a huge chunk of yorik coral from the vessel&#x2019;s fantail. Han<br>tweaked the yoke to place the skip in the Money Lane, and his left<br>hand tightened on the trigger of the belly gun&#x2019;s remote firing mechanism.<br>Sustained bursts from the twin cannons whittled the skip to<br>half its size; then it blew, throwing pieces of coral wreckage in every<br>direction.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s for the swoop pilot,&#x201d; Han said soberly. He turned his<br>attention to the second skip, which, desperate to avoid a similar fate,<br>was jinking and juking all over the sky.<br><br>Zipping through the showering remains of the first kill, the <i>Falcon<br></i>quickened up and pounced on the wildly maneuvering skip from<br>above. The targeting reticle went red, and a target-lock tone filled the<br>cockpit. Again the quad lasers rallied, catching the vessel with burst<br>after burst until it disappeared in a nimbus of coral dust and whitehot<br>gas.<br><br>Han and Leia hooted. &#x201c;Nice shooting, Cakhmaim!&#x201d; he said into<br>the headset. &#x201c;Score two more for the good guys.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia watched him for a moment. &#x201c;Happy now?&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of replying, Han pushed the yoke away from him, dropping<br>the <i>Falcon </i>to within meters of the surging waves. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the<br>swoop?&#x201d; he asked finally.<br><br>Leia was ready with the answer. &#x201c;Come around sixty degrees, and<br>it should be right in front of us.&#x201d;<br><br>Han adjusted course, and the swoop came into view, streaking<br>over the surface, bearing two seriously dissimilar riders. In pursuit,<br>and just visible beneath the surface, moved an enormous olive-drab<br>triangle, trailing what appeared to be a lengthy tail.<br><br>Han&#x2019;s jaw dropped.<br><br>&#x201c;What is that thing?&#x201d; Leia said.<br><br>&#x201c;Threepio, get in here!&#x201d; Han yelled, without taking his eyes from<br>the creature.<br><br>C-3PO staggered into the cockpit, clamping his hands on the<br>high-backed navigator&#x2019;s chair to keep from being thrown off balance,<br>as had too often happened.<br><br>Han raised his right hand to the viewport and pointed. &#x201c;What is<br>that?&#x201d; he asked, enunciating every word.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, my,&#x201d; the droid began. &#x201c;I believe that what we&#x2019;re looking at<br>is a kind of boat creature. The Yuuzhan Vong term for it is <i>vangaak</i>,<br>which derives from the verb &#x2018;to submerge.&#x2019; Although in this case the<br>verb has been modified to suggest&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Skip the language lesson and just tell me how to kill it!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I would suggest targeting the flat dome, clearly visible on<br>its dorsal surface.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A head shot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Precisely. A head shot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Han,&#x201d; Leia interrupted. &#x201c;Four more coralskippers headed our<br>way.&#x201d;<br><br>Han manipulated levers on the console, and the <i>Falcon </i>accelerated.<br>&#x201c;We gotta work fast. Threepio, tell Meewalh to activate the<br>manual release for the landing ramp. I&#x2019;ll be there in a flash.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia watched him undo the clasps of the crash webbing. &#x201c;I take it<br>you&#x2019;re not planning to land.&#x201d;<br><br>He kissed her on the cheek as he stood up. &#x201c;Not if I can help it.&#x201d;<br><br>The swoop fought to maintain an altitude of eight meters, but<br>that was enough to keep it from the snapping jaws of the Yuuzhan<br>Vong vangaak that had almost snagged it on surfacing.<br><br>Thorsh might have opted to head inland if the Yuuzhan Vong<br>search parties and their snarling beasts hadn&#x2019;t reached the marshy<br>shore. Worse, four specks in the northern sky were almost certainly<br>coralskippers, soaring in to reinforce the pair the YT-1300 was chasing.<br>Instead, the Jenet had the swoop aimed for deeper water, out<br>toward the volcano, where the waves mounded to a height of ten<br>meters.<br><br>Thorsh and his rider could feel the sting of the saline spray on<br>their scratched and bruised faces and hands. Behind them, the vangaak<br>was rapidly closing the gap, but if it had weapons other than tor-<br>pedo analogs it wasn&#x2019;t bringing them to bear. An unsettling vociferation<br>from the Bith broke Thorsh&#x2019;s concentration.<br><br>&#x201c;The vangaak&#x2019;s gone! It submerged!&#x201d;<br><br>Thorsh didn&#x2019;t know whether to worry or celebrate. The vangaak<br>put a quick end to his indecision. Breaching the surface in front of the<br>swoop, the dull olive triangle spiked straight up out of the waves,<br>venting seawater from blowholes on its dorsal side, and opening its<br>tooth-filled mouth.<br><br>Thorsh demanded all he could from the swoop, climbing at<br>maximum boost, but there was no escaping the reach of the creature.<br><br>He heard a surprised scream, then felt his flight jacket rip away.<br>Lightened, the swoop ascended at greater speed, only to stall. Thorsh<br>threw a distraught glance over his shoulder. The Bith was pinned<br>between the vangaak&#x2019;s teeth, mouth wide in a silent scream, black eyes<br>dull, Thorsh&#x2019;s jacket still clutched in his dexterous hands. But there<br>wasn&#x2019;t time for despair or anger. The repulsorlift came back to life,<br>and Thorsh veered away, even as he was falling.<br><br>A roar battered his eardrums, and suddenly the YT-1300 was practically<br>alongside him, skimming the waves not fifty meters away. The<br>quartet of coralskippers began firing from extreme range, their plasma<br>projectiles cutting scalding trails through the whitecapped crests.<br><br>The old freighter&#x2019;s landing ramp was lowered from the starboard<br>docking arm. It was clear what the ship&#x2019;s pilots had in mind. They<br>were expecting him to come alongside and hurl himself onto the<br>narrow incline. But Thorsh faltered. He knew the limitations of the<br>swoop, and&#x2014;more important&#x2014;his own. With the coralskippers approaching<br>and the vangaak submerged who-knew-where beneath the<br>waves, it was unlikely that he could even reach the freighter in time.<br>Additionally&#x2014;and despite what were obviously military-grade de-<br>flector shields&#x2014;the freighter was being forced to make slight vertical<br>and horizontal adjustments, which only decreased Thorsh&#x2019;s chances of<br>clambering aboard.<br><br>His grimace disappeared, and in its place came a look of sharp<br>attentiveness.<br><br>As sole bearer of the secret intelligence contained in the holo-<br>wafer, he had to give it his best try. Tightening his grip, he banked for<br>the sanctuary of the matte-black ship.<br>Crouched at the top of the extended ramp, Han peered down at<br>the rushing water not twenty meters below. Wind and salt spray<br>howled through the opening, blowing his hair every which way and<br>making it difficult for him to keep his eyes open.<br><br>&#x201c;Captain Solo,&#x201d; C-3PO said from the ring corridor. &#x201c;Princess<br>Leia wishes you to know that the swoop is approaching. Apparently<br>the pilot feels confident that he can complete the transfer to <i>Millennium<br>Falcon </i>without suffering too much internal damage or . . . perishing<br>in the attempt.&#x201d;<br><br>Han threw the droid a wide-eyed look. &#x201c;Perishing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly the odds are against him. If he were piloting a speeder<br>bike, perhaps. But swoops are notorious for going out of control at<br>the slightest provocation!&#x201d;<br><br>Han nodded grimly. A former swoop racer, he knew that C-3PO<br>was right. Taking in the situation now, he wondered if even he could<br>make the jump.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to the bottom!&#x201d; he shouted.<br><br>C-3PO canted his golden head. &#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br><br>Han made a downward motion. &#x201c;The bottom of the ramp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir, I have a bad feeling . . .&#x201d;<br><br>The wind drowned out the rest of the droid&#x2019;s words. Han crabbed<br>down to the base of the ramp, where he could hear the <i>Falcon</i>&#x2019;s belly<br>turret slicing through the agitated peaks of the waves. A distinctive<br>throbbing sound captured his attention. The swoop was beginning to<br>angle for the ramp. The pilot&#x2014;a Jenet, of all species&#x2014;took his right<br>hand off the handgrips just long enough to signal Han with a wave.<br>Considering that even that slight movement sent the swoop into a<br>wobble, there was simply no way the Jenet would be able to let go<br>completely&#x2014;especially not with the <i>Falcon </i>adding to the turbulence<br>of the sea itself.<br><br>Han reconsidered, then swung around to C-3PO.<br><br>&#x201c;Threepio, tell Leia we&#x2019;re going with Plan B!&#x201d;<br><br>The droid raised his hands to his head in distress. &#x201c;Captain Solo,<br>just the sound of that makes me worry!&#x201d;<br><br>Han raised his forefinger. &#x201c;Just tell Leia, Threepio. She&#x2019;ll<br>understand.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Plan B?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was precisely my reaction,&#x201d; C-3PO said in an agitated<br>voice. &#x201c;But does anyone ever listen to my concerns?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Threepio, I&#x2019;m sure Han knows what he&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is hardly a comforting thought, Princess.&#x201d;<br><br>Leia swung back to the console and allowed her eyes to roam over<br>the instruments. <i>Plan B, </i>she mused. <i>What can Han have in mind? </i>She<br>placed him squarely in her thoughts, then smiled in sudden revelation.<br><br><i>Of course </i>. . .<br><br>Her hands slid switches while she studied the displays. Then she<br>sat away from the console in contemplation. Yes, she decided at last,<br>she supposed it could be done&#x2014;though it would mean relying largely<br>on the attitude and braking thrusters, and hoping that they didn&#x2019;t stall<br>or fail.<br><br>She looked over her shoulder at C-3PO, who had evidently followed<br>her every move and manipulation.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell Han I&#x2019;ve got everything worked out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, dear,&#x201d; the droid said, turning and exiting the cockpit. &#x201c;Oh,<br>dear.&#x201d;<br>The four coralskippers were closing fast, lobbing plasma missiles<br>into the blustery stretch of water between the swoop and the freighter.<br>Thorsh dipped his head instinctively as one fireball plunged into the<br>waves not ten meters away. The ferocity of the impact geysered superheated<br>water high into the air, and sent the swoop into a sustained<br>wobble.<br><br>The freighter held to its course regardless, its top gunner keeping<br>the coralskippers at bay with bursts of laserfire. A human male was<br>crouched at the base of the landing ramp, his left arm wrapped around<br>one of the telescoping hydraulic struts, and the fingers of his right<br>hand making a gesture that on some worlds implied craziness on the<br>part of its recipient.

"A Beginner's Guide to Short-term Trading" is written to those of you who want to profit by grabbing the "sweet spots" out of a stock's uptrend or downtrend. The book explains two styles of trading: swing trading and position trading. When you place a swing trade, you buy a stock with the intent of taking gains in 2 - 5 days. When you enter a position trade, you typically buy a stock breaking out of a base into an uptrend. You hold that position as long as the stock rises in that uptrend, approximately 3 - 6 weeks. <p>If you have a have full-time job, yet want to participate in the stock market, short-term trading may appeal to you. And, if you're a traditional buy-and-hold investor, the knowledge you find in this book will help you keep your profits, instead of gaining them . . . and then giving them back. </p><p>I wrote "A Beginner's Guide to Short-Term Trading" in the same lighthearted, reader-friendly style as my previous book, "A Beginner's Guide to Day Trading Online." Although the material is comprehensive and substantial, I firmly believe that humor, woven into a serious subject like the stock market, promotes the learning process. I also continued the "Center Points," as I've received a lot of positive feedback from people who enjoyed them in my last book. </p><p>"A Beginner's Guide to Short-Term Trading," is designed to teach you skills and strategies needed to enter the stock market on a relatively short-term basis, safely and successfully. Please educate yourself thoroughly before you jump into the market, just as you would do with any worthwhile endeavor. </p><p>My best wishes are with you, and keep those trades green!

I love my mom, but this was the same woman who swore by espresso enemas to perk up your spirits. The same woman who performed magic spells and exorcisms on a regular basis and astral traveled around the universe with her trusted spirit guide, Ramlar X.</p><p>Believe me, I&#x2019;m very careful about taking advice from my mother.</p><p>Besides, the thing I was wishing for was more work. Why would that be a problem?</p><p>I&#x2019;d been in between bookbinding jobs last month and was telling my friend Ian McCullough, chief curator of the Covington Library, that I wished I could find some new and interesting bookbinding work. That&#x2019;s when Ian revealed that he had submitted my name to the television show This Old Attic to be their expert book appraiser. I was beside myself with excitement and immediately contacted the show&#x2019;s producer for an interview. And I got it! I got what I wished for. A job. A great job. With books.</p><p>That was a good thing, right?</p><p>Of course, I didn&#x2019;t dare tell my mother that I considered her advice a bunch of malarkey. After all, some of those magic spells she&#x2019;d spun had turned out to be alarmingly effective. I would hate to incur her wrath and wake up wearing a donkey&#x2019;s head&#x2014;or worse.</p><p>&#x201c;Yo, Brooklyn,&#x201d; Angie, the show&#x2019;s stage manager said. &#x201c;You look right into this camera and start talking. Got it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; I lied, pressing my hands against my knees to keep them from shaking uncontrollably. &#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; the stage manager said. &#x201c;No dead air. Got it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dead air. Right. Got it.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded once, then shouted to the studio in general, &#x201c;Five minutes, everyone!&#x201d;</p><p>I felt my stomach drop, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. I was in show business!</p><p>This Old Attic traveled around the country and featured regular people who wanted their precious family treasures and heirlooms appraised by various local experts. The production was taping in San Francisco for three whole weeks, and I was giggly with pleasure to be a part of it.</p><p>And terrified, too. But the nerves were sure to pass as soon as I started talking about my favorite topic: books. I hoped so, anyway.</p><p>Today was the initial day of taping and my segment was up first. My little staging area was decorated to look like a cozy antiques-strewn hideaway in the corner of a charming, dust-free attic. There were Oriental carpets on the floor. A Tiffany lamp hung from the light grid, which was suspended high above the set. Old-fashioned wooden dressers, curio cabinets, and armoires stood side by side, creating the three walls of my area. I sat in the middle of it all in a comfy blue tufted chair at a round table covered with a cloth of rich burgundy velvet.</p><p>Seated across from me was the owner of the book we would be discussing. She was a pretty, middle-aged woman with an impressive bosom and thick black hair styled in the biggest bouffant hairdo I&#x2019;d ever seen. She wore a clingy zebra-print dress with a shiny black belt that cinched in her waist and emphasized her shapely hourglass figure.</p><p>She had excellent posture, though. I&#x2019;d give her that much. My mother would be impressed.</p><p>Between us on the table was a wooden bookstand with her book in place, ready to be appraised.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you Vera?&#x201d; I whispered. I&#x2019;d already seen her name on the segment rundown but wanted to be friendly.</p><p>She smiled weakly. &#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;m Vera Stoddard.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled at the sound of her high-pitched little-girl voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Brooklyn. It&#x2019;s good to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Settle down, people!&#x201d; Angie shouted, and everyone in the television studio instantly stopped talking. Angie listened to something being said over her headset and then added loudly, &#x201c;First on camera today is the book expert. It&#x2019;s segment eight-six-nineteen on the rundown, people! Stand by!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so nervous,&#x201d; Vera whispered.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. We&#x2019;ll have a good time.&#x201d; I could hear my voice shaking but I smiled cheerfully, hoping she wouldn&#x2019;t notice. It wasn&#x2019;t like me to be this anxious. All I had to do was talk about books, something I was born to do. It was a piece of cake. Unless I thought about the millions of people who would be watching. It didn&#x2019;t help that several zillion watts of lighting were aimed down at me, and the stage makeup I wore, while it made me look glamorous, was beginning to feel like an iron mask.</p><p>&#x201c;So stop thinking about it,&#x201d; I muttered, and plastered a determined smile on my face.</p><p>Angie caught my eye and pointed again at the television camera to her right. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget, this camera here is your friend. This is camera one. When you see the red light go on, it means you&#x2019;re on the screen.&#x201d; She turned and pointed to another camera a few feet behind her on the left. &#x201c;Camera two will get close-ups of the book and the owner&#x2019;s reactions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; I said, nodding firmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Angie glanced around, then bellowed, &#x201c;Here we go! Quiet, please! We&#x2019;re live in . . . Five! Four! Three! Two!&#x201d; She mouthed the word One and waved her finger emphatically at me.</p><p>I took a deep breath and tried to smile at the friendly camera. &#x201c;Hello. I&#x2019;m Brooklyn Wainwright, a bookbinder specializing in rare-book restoration and conservation. Today I&#x2019;m talking with Vera, who&#x2019;s brought us a charming first edition of the beloved children&#x2019;s classicThe Secret Garden, written by Frances Hodgson Burnett.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled at the older woman and noticed her lips were trembling badly and her eyes were two big circles of fear. Not a good sign. So instead of engaging her in conversation, I gestured toward the colorful book on the bookstand.</p><p>&#x201c;This version of The Secret Garden was printed as a special limited edition in nineteen eleven.&#x201d;</p><p>I touched the book&#x2019;s cover. &#x201c;The first thing you&#x2019;ll notice about the book is this stunning illustration on the front cover. The iconic picture of a blond girl in her red coat and beret, leaning over to insert a key into the moss-covered door that leads to the secret garden, is famous in its own right. There are some wonderful details, such as this whimsical frame around the picture, painted in various shades of green with thick vines of pink roses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even notice that,&#x201d; Vera muttered in her oddly charming sexy-baby voice.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s subtle,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The artist was Maria Kirk, known professionally as M. L. Kirk. She was never as famous as her illustrations were, but she did beautiful work. Isn&#x2019;t this lovely?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; Vera said softly.</p><p>I picked up the book and stood it near me on the table, keeping the cover turned toward the camera. &#x201c;What makes this even more outstanding is that this illustration is actually an original painting on canvas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You can see that it&#x2019;s been signed by the artist here in the lower-left corner.&#x201d;</p><p>Vera blinked in surprise and leaned closer. &#x201c;Oh. And look, there&#x2019;s a robin in the tree.&#x201d;</p><p>I grinned at her, happy that she was getting into the spirit of things. The show&#x2019;s director had urged us to keep the owner in the conversation, so I hoped Vera would play along. &#x201c;Yes, that robin has a role in the story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I like birds,&#x201d; she said with a sigh.</p><p>Uh-oh. I shot a quick look at her. Was Vera going spacey on me? My smile stayed firmly in place as I spoke to the camera. &#x201c;Another unusual feature is that the painting has actually been inlaid into the leather cover. You can see how the edges of the leather have been beveled so nicely.&#x201d; For the camera, I ran my fingers along the edge of the beveling and gave silent thanks to my friend Robin, who had insisted that I get a manicure before the show.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like that before,&#x201d; Vera said, her spacey moment apparently past.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really quite rare,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;The bookbinder was clearly an artist, too, in the way he chose a rich forest green leather to blend with the painter&#x2019;s softer green frame. And the intricate floral gilding on the leather is patterned after the vines and roses on the painting.&#x201d; I glanced at Vera. &#x201c;Do you have any idea what the book might be worth?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a clue,&#x201d; she said, shaking her head. &#x201c;It cost three dollars at a garage sale last Saturday.&#x201d;</p><p>I choked out a laugh. &#x201c;Wow. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m giving too much away if I tell you it&#x2019;s worth a little more than that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, good.&#x201d; She pressed her hands to her remarkable chest, obviously relieved by the news. Maybe now she would be able to carry on a normal conversation. Her voice was high yet sultry, but it seemed to suit her personality. I wasn&#x2019;t sure why I thought that. I&#x2019;d never met her before this moment.</p><p>I opened the book and showed the frontispiece illustration to the camera. &#x201c;There are eight color plates throughout the book, all in excellent condition and each with tissue guards intact.&#x201d;</p><p>I angled the book toward Vera. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re charming illustrations, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded politely. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re very nice.&#x201d;</p><p>Nice? I thought. Was she kidding? They were spectacular. The entire book was fantastic. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it had been allowed to molder away in someone&#x2019;s garage. But I wasn&#x2019;t about to criticize Vera&#x2019;s lackluster response aloud.</p><p>I should&#x2019;ve been used to that sort of attitude by now. Nobody gushed about books as much as bookbinders did. I would&#x2019;ve loved to have mentioned how rare it was that a children&#x2019;s book printed in 1911 was this beautifully preserved. Children were not generally known for their ability to treat books gently.</p><p>I sighed inwardly and changed the subject. &#x201c;Now, obviously not every copy of this book could be printed with original artwork attached to its cover. So let me explain briefly about this particular edition. Back in nineteen eleven, when this book was printed, a publisher would occasionally release two versions of the same book. A regular edition and a limited, more expensive edition. This version is obviously one of the limited-edition copies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How limited?&#x201d; Vera asked, her gaze focusing in on the book.</p><p>&#x201c;Very.&#x201d; I turned to the next page. It was almost blank except for two lines of print in the middle. &#x201c;This is called the limitation page. It states here that only fifty copies of this numbered edition were printed. And the number six is handwritten on the next line. So this particular book is number six out of fifty copies made. It&#x2019;s beyond rare.&#x201d;</p><p>Vera gulped. &#x201c;And . . . and that&#x2019;s good, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s very good. And, of course, you will have noticed that on the same page we see that it&#x2019;s been authenticated with the date and original signature of the author, Frances Hodgson Burnett.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I did notice that.&#x201d; She bit her lip, still nervous, though this time I figured it was from excitement, not fear.</p><p>Now that she was finally showing some emotion, it was time to bum her out. Earlier at rehearsal, Jane Dorsey, the show&#x2019;s director, had advised us to balance things out by mentioning a few negatives. So I flipped to a page in the middle. &#x201c;I should point out a few flaws.&#x201d;</p><p>Vera&#x2019;s expression darkened. &#x201c;No, you shouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>I chuckled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but the book isn&#x2019;t without its imperfections.&#x201d; I faced the page toward the camera and pointed at some little brown spots. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s foxing on a number of pages. These patches of brownish discoloration are fairly common in old books.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eww.&#x201d; She drew the word out as she leaned in to get a good look. &#x201c;Are those bugs?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. They&#x2019;re clumps of microscopic spores, but that&#x2019;s not important. Sometimes foxing can be lightened or bleached, but you should always hire a professional bookbinder to do the work.&#x201d;</p><p>Turning to the inside front cover, I said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s also an additional signature on the endpaper, right here.&#x201d; I made sure the camera could see what I was referring to, and then I took a closer look at it myself. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t look like a child&#x2019;s handwriting. It was probably a parent signing for the child. I can&#x2019;t quite make out the name, but I assume it&#x2019;s the signature of one of the book&#x2019;s first owners. They used a fountain pen, and it&#x2019;s faded a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s a bad thing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Writing one&#x2019;s name in a book can diminish its value, but that&#x2019;s another topic altogether.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not dwell on the negatives,&#x201d; I hurried to add, &#x201c;because other than those items and a few faded spots on the leather, it&#x2019;s in excellent condition and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And what?&#x201d; Vera demanded, interrupting what was about to be my rapturous summary of the book&#x2019;s qualities.</p><p>I pursed my lips, thinking quickly. I had been given six minutes to talk about the book, but the director had warned me that as soon as I revealed my appraisal amount, my segment would be over, even if I had minutes to spare.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t ready to stop talking about the book&#x2014;big surprise. But Vera was finished listening and it was time to put her out of her misery. More important, I noticed Angie hovering. And Randolph Rayburn, the handsome host of the show, stood next to her, looking ready to pounce into the camera shot and cut me off.</p><p>&#x201c;And for a book of this rarity,&#x201d; I continued hastily, &#x201c;in such fine condition and with the author&#x2019;s original signature included, it&#x2019;s my expert opinion that an antiquarian book dealer would pay anywhere from twenty to twenty-five thousand dollars for this book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wha&#x2014;?&#x201d; Vera&#x2019;s eyes bugged out of their sockets. &#x201c;Twenty . . .

Everyone in the studio started talking again, moving here and there between the sets, carrying on normal conversations.</p><p>I had watched the program a bunch of times, so I knew that when they went in to edit the shows, they would plaster across the TV screen a green graphic banner announcing the amount of money I had quoted, accompanied by the sound of a cash register making a sale.Cha-ching!</p><p>Angie approached me, but suddenly stopped and cupped her hand over her ear to hear what was being said over the headset.

Not only is he the only dog Leandra, Paul, and Jeannie have ever met with a first and a last name, he's a living, breathing monster! When they ride their bikes, he chases them, snapping at their heels. When they run, he runs. If they cross the street, he follows. There's no getting away from him -- over him or under him. He's their number one enemy. <br> Leandra, Paul, and Jeannie try to come up with a plan to stop Tippy Lemmey, but nothing works. But then Tippy does something totally unexpected, and the kids realize that maybe he's not their enemy after all.</p><p>Patricia C.

Narrator Leandra and her friends Jeannie and Paul agree that the new neighborhood dog, called Tippy Lemmey, has a "sweet teddy-bear face," but there's no question that he's making their lives miserable by chasing, barking, and snapping at them. Nothing they do seems to help. Then Tippy is dognapped, and the kids are torn between enjoying their peace and rescuing a critter they know is someone's beloved pet. Their decision to help their nemesis leads to unexpected troubles and a surprising discovery, as the pup eventually turns out to be a good doggy friend. Leandra is an observant, appealing narrator, whose dilemmas are sympathetically portrayed, and the book's short chapters, straightforward prose, and suspense will keep the pages turning. Although the story is set in 1951 in Templeton, Tennessee, and there are a few references to the Korean War, readers will be more involved with the canine conflict than the backdrop.

But at a traveler&#39;s inn, he encounters an unexpected and far more maddening foe: Sorrel Kendrick, a young lady who is strikingly pretty, shockingly outspoken, and entirely unimpressed with him. Indeed, Sorrel cannot believe the nerve of this gentleman, who rudely accuses her of theft and insults her feminine dignity. Doubly annoyed when they both end up at a party hosted by mutual friends, Philip and Sorrel privately declare war on one another. But Philip&#39;s tactics, which range from flirting to indifference, soon backfire as he finds himself reluctantly enjoying Sorrel&#39;s company; and, much to her dismay, Sorrel finds Philip&#39;s odd manner to be increasingly endearing. In the midst of this waning war and growing attraction, Philip catches wind of the French spy he&#39;s been tracking, and Sorrel inadvertently stumbles upon a crucial piece of the puzzle, making her indispensable to the mission. But can two proud hearts negotiate a ceasefire when cooperation matters most?</p><p>Sarah M. Eden read her first Jane Austen novel in elementary school and has been an Austen addict ever since.

Writing in <em>Harper's</em>, Irving Howe described it as "an exhilarating performance--this, one tells oneself, is what the life of the mind can be."<br> Berlin's editor Henry Hardy has revised the text, incorporating a fifth essay that Berlin himself had wanted to include. He has also added further pieces that bear on the same topic, so that Berlin's principal statements on liberty are at last available together in one volume. Finally, in an extended preface and in appendices drawn from Berlin's unpublished writings, he exhibits some of the biographical sources of Berlin's lifelong preoccupation with liberalism. These additions help us to grasp the nature of Berlin's "inner citadel," as he called it--the core of personal conviction from which some of his most influential writing sprung.<br></p><p><br>Isaiah Berlin was a Fellow of All Souls and New College, Professor of Social and Political Theory, and founding President of Wolfson College. He also held the Presidency of the British Academy. He died in 1997. Henry Hardy is a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, and is one of Isaiah Berlin's Literary Trustees. He has edited several other books by Berlin, and is currently preparing his letters and his remaining unpublished writings for publication.<br>'For anyone wishing to have the essence of Berlin's thinking, Liberty is the volume to have.'

Browne was an inspiration to the Romantics as well as to W.G. Sebald, and his work is quirky, sonorous, and enchanting. <br><br>Here this baroque master&#x2019;s two most enduring and admired works, <i>Religio Medici</i> and <i>Urne-Buriall</i>, appear in a new edition that has been annotated and introduced by the distinguished scholars Ramie Targoff and Stephen Greenblatt (author of the best-selling <i>Will in the World</i> and the National Book Award&#x2013;winning <i>The Swerve</i>). In <i>Religio Medici</i> Browne mulls over the relation between his medical profession and his profession of the Christian faith, pondering the respective claims of science and religion, questions that are still very much alive today. The discovery of an ancient burial site in an English field prompted Browne to write Urne-Buriall, which is both an early&nbsp; anthropological examination of different practices of interment and a profound meditation on mortality. Its grave and exquisite music has resounded for generations.</p><p>Sir Thomas Browne (1605&#x2013;1682) was the son of a prosperous London merchant who died while his son was still young. Browne attended Winchester College and Oxford, then spent several years studying medicine at Montpellier, Padua, and Leiden, before receiving his MD in 1633. In 1637 he settled in Norwich where he practiced medicine and lived for the rest of his life. <i>Religio Medici</i> was first published in 1642, without the author&#x2019;s consent; a year later he approved a new printing (with some of the controversial material removed), and the book became a best seller, subsequently translated into several European languages (and placed on the Papal Index). Browne&#x2019;s eccentric encyclopedia, <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>, was first published in 1646 and went through six editions. His last work to be published in his lifetime, <i>Urne-Buriall</i>, appeared in 1658.

It is an era, too, in which the roles of parents and professionals require them to reconsider their individual responsibilities. Who decides what a child will learn? And who takes action to see that the learning happens? Simply stated, this new era for children with special needs requires parents to reexamine what it means to be a parent and requires teachers to reexamine what it means to be a teacher.</p><p><b>PARENT ROLES</b></p><p>There is no one "correct" approach to reexamining roles. Teaching is a natural part of being a parent. Virtually every time you interact with your child, you are teaching him or her something &#x2014; whether you realize it or not. Many parents of children with special needs have decided to become more intentional teachers; some parents are conducting daily teaching sessions in their home. Other parents, after considering their full range of responsibilities at work and/or at home, have realistically decided that an everyday teaching role would be impractical. Their teaching will have to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves throughout the day or on the weekend. In either case, the child gains, particularly when the parents have participated actively with their child's teachers in shaping an individualized education program (IEP). We talk more about working with your child's school in Chapter 20.</p><p><b>GOOD TEACHING</b></p><p>One of our basic assumptions in writing this book was that no matter what decisions you may have made about your role as a teacher, you will be better able to fulfill that role if you understand firsthand what good teaching is all about. Put another way, once you know how to teach your child a skill systematically &#x2014; from beginning to end &#x2014; and once you know how to manage behavior problems, then you will be a much better collaborator with others in your child's educational world.</p><p>A related assumption is that the only way to learn about good skills teaching is to do good skills teaching. Of course, you have already taught your child many skills. (Take a minute and think about all of the things your child has learned to do with your help.) For most readers, this book primarily will strengthen teaching skills they already have and suggest new ways to use them. But whether or not you have been teaching already in the systematic way we suggest, while you read this book we urge you to find some time, somehow, during which you will teach your child another new skill. We're not suggesting that you find additional teaching time to spend with your child. We're simply suggesting that you take some of the time you already spend and direct it toward what we believe will be a rewarding and long-lasting experience for you both. Like most parents, you'll probably be delighted at how good you are at teaching. But, just as important, you'll be much better prepared to be a partner on your child's educational team.</p><p><b>PHILOSOPHIES AND FADS</b></p><p>"Okay," you might say. "Teaching certainly makes sense. But there seem to be a lot of ways to go about this. What's the approach in this book, and how do I know whether it will work?" Good questions. The disability field has more than its share of different approaches, each with very vocal cheerleaders. It is very difficult to be an informed consumer, to separate the various philosophies about education for people with developmental disabilities from sound evidence about what works.</p><p>Because we want to help children with intellectual and related disabilities, we are particularly aware of new fads and philosophies. Some of these will be found to have merit and will survive to become the common practices of tomorrow. Others will fade, to be replaced by whatever next new trend is rounding the corner. For example, a philosophy that is guiding educators' thinking today is full inclusion &#x2014; the proposition that all children with special needs should be educated entirely within the general education environment. This is an extreme outgrowth of earlier philosophies, such as integration, mainstreaming, and normalization, which argued that opportunities for children with special needs should be as close as possible to those for typically developing children. These earlier ideas turned out not to be passing fads but perspectives that have become widely accepted, not so much because they were demonstrated to "work," but because they seemed to many of us to be the right thing to do.</p><p>Other philosophies and fads have not fared so well. Have you heard of patterning? Megavitamin therapy? Additive-free diets? Facilitated communication? Each of these offered new hope to parents and absorbed immeasurable amounts of time and money, only to finally be discarded from the weight of professional opinion and scientific studies that failed to document success.</p><p>Be assured that the teaching techniques in this book are based on principles of behavior change, primarily those of applied behavior analysis, which educators have known and practiced for decades. They have been derived from thousands of published studies of effective teaching, as well as from the shared experiences of countless parents and teachers. These behavioral teaching principles have become an integral part of effective school programs.</p><p>Although most educators would generally agree with the broad teaching principles we employ, there is one point with which some will disagree. Some educators argue that teaching should always be done informally, in the child's natural environment and within ongoing play and living activities. Other educators point out the benefits of separate designated teaching sessions in which the teacher repeatedly practices a skill with the child. Our opinion is . . . well, it depends. There is good evidence that both approaches are successful, and a blend of the two approaches is likely best for most children. You will decide how closely to follow the specific teaching programs that we suggest and how much to adapt them to provide teaching moments throughout your child's day.</p><p><b>YOU'RE THE EXPERT</b></p><p>A final point before we &#x2014; and you &#x2014; get started. It's an obvious point, perhaps, but one that hundreds of parents reminded us could not be made too often. Though you may be the parent or teacher of a child with special needs, you are unlike any other parent or teacher of such children. You are uniquely you. You have your own dreams and visions, your own wants and needs. And in one essential way, you have a kind of information that no one else could possibly have: You know your child more intimately than anyone else.</p><p>We ask you, therefore, as you begin this book, not to think at all about trying to change who you are. Rather, add to what is uniquely you a new set of skills and, perhaps, a new way of looking at your child, to become an even more substantial partner in building his educational future. Much of what we say here may not seem all that new to you; perhaps you've already used a version of the techniques we describe. It is our hope, though, that this book will help you to build on these experiences so that you can do what you are doing even better. Remember: Keep your expectations high &#x2014; for both you and your child.</p><p>Chapter 2 gets you started on the road to becoming a successful skills teacher. But before jumping in, let's take a moment to look at one parent who's already been traveling that road for some time. The teaching program you're about to glimpse will, on the surface, seem fairly simple. But the strategies behind it were carefully developed and practiced in ways that you'll learn about in the following chapters.</p><p>Excerpted from chapter 1 of <b>Steps to Independence: Teaching Everyday Skills to Children with Special Needs, <i>Fourth Edition,</i></b> by Bruce L.

Reexamining the narrative of the death and resurrection of Jesus from the middle day-liturgically named as Holy Saturday-she seeks a theology that addresses the experience of living in the aftermath of trauma. Through a reinterpretation of "remaining" in the Johannine Gospel, she proposes a new theology of the Spirit that challenges traditional conceptions of redemption.

This book, which introduces the Westerner to a rich and mysterious world, is based on a classic compilation of the Chinese language done in the 18th century, which determined that all the characters then in use were devised from 214 root pictographs or symbols. Each of these 214 key characters, called radicals is charmingly explored by the author, both for its etymology and for what it reveals about Chinese history and culture. Chinese characters are marvels of graphic design, and this book shows, stroke by stroke, how each radical is written and gives examples of how radicals are combined with other radicals and character elements to form new characters.</p><p><b>Edoardo Fazzioli,</b> who has studied Chinese language and culture at Hong Kong University and is a member of the Italo&#x2013;Chinese Institute for Economic and Cultural Exchange, has written newspaper articles and scholarly pieces on Chinese life and civilization.<br>Excerpt from <i>Chinese Calligraphy:</i> <br> <br> <b>A Living Language, Six Thousand Years Old</b> <br> <br>Many great civilizations have punctuated man&#x2019;s presence on earth, but only the Chinese civilization has survived into modern times with its principal characteristics intact. Also and this makes it unique it retains a language more than 6,000 years old. This is undoubtedly the outcome of a series of happy coincidences but, first and foremost, it results from the Chinese system of writing: those fascinating, mysterious characters, each of which hides a snatch of history, literature, art and popular wisdom.<br> <br>Never has the word calligraphy been so aptly used as here, even though it is still difficult for the Western eye to appreciate the full beauty and depth of this writing or to understand the aesthetic message contained in its lines. The nature of the written language and the use of the same instruments, brush and ink, has ensured that the writing of characters has formed an integral part of the history of Chinese painting.<br> <br>W�ng Xi Zhi (321-379), the "calligrapher sage" who lived under the Eastern Jin (317-420), is regarded as the greatest master of all time and the model for all those wishing to become engaged in the art of character writing. His rich poetical and imaginative style is conveyed in his portrayal of writing as a real battle. In his work <i>The Calligraphic Strategy of the Lady W�i,</i> he writes: "The sheet of paper is a battleground; the brush: the lances and swords; the ink: the mind, the commander-in-chief; ability and dexterity: the deputies; the composition: the strategy. By grasping the brush the outcome of the battle is decided: the strokes and lines are the commanders orders; the curves and returns are the mortal blows." An exciting battle, but fortunately a bloodless one: one of the few that mankind can enjoy and be proud of.<br> <br>The first characters were incised, using wooden sticks, pointed stones, jade knives or bronze styli. These are the marks we find on ceramics, on bones, inside vases and on bronze artefacts. The graphic transformation of characters was caused by changes in the implements used for writing or the introduction of new writing surfaces such as wood, silk and paper. On a Shang bronze (16th-11th century B.C.) we find a design for a pen with a reservoir; it takes the form of a cup shaped container attached to one end of a hollow straw which deposited the colouring liquid on strips of bamboo. The result was a thick, uniform line. Around 213 B.C. widespread use appears to have been made of brushes with a fibrous tip suitable for writing on silk: these worked faster, but were still too rigid and gave a thick, square line.<br> <br>During the same period a further advance was made by replacing the fibrous tip with one made of leather, which was softer and more flexible. It is to a general in the imperial army of the Q�n dynasty (229-206 B.C.), however, that we owe a marked improvement in the quality of writing instruments. M�ng Ti�n, who wielded the sword as skillfully as the brush, replaced the leather tip with a tuft of soft animal hairs. His intuitive innovation was linked to the discovery of a new writing material: paper. This quickly absorbed the water, making it possible to create lines of varying intensity. He maintained that the brush, with its very soft, pliable tip, could create every sort of effect when placed in the hands of a skilled calligrapher: everything from a thin, thread like line to a thick one; from a full, rich stroke to a broken, fading one; from a squared line to a rounded one with either a sharp or blunted point. This moment marked the birth of calligraphy, which now entered the history of Chinese painting and was treated with the same honour and dignity accorded to figurative works.<br> <br>Apart from the instrument and the writing surface, another important element was India ink, in fact a Chinese discovery, obtained from soot, or lampblack, mixed into a paste with glue and perfumed with camphor and musk. Shaped into tablets or small sticks, it was decorated with figures or extracts from famous calligraphers written in gold characters. It is one of the "treasures of the literate," together with the brush, the paper and the "ink stone" (a type of Chinese ink pot). These stones were carefully selected, then carved and finely decorated, with two wells hollowed out in their surface: one to act as a container for water; the other, larger, in which to rub the ink tablet to produce a fine black powder. This would then be diluted with water. Using the best stones, and skillfully mixing the powder with water, it is possible to obtain the shades known to the Chinese as "the five shades of black."<br> <br> <b>The history and mythology of a script</b> <br> <br>Knots tied in lengths of vegetable fiber, which represented a sort of calendar, marked the first attempts by Chinese man to establish records. Later on, notches scored on wooden laths acted as a means of recording harvests and other events; later still, sticks, stones and bones were used to make marks on clay objects. The Neolithic village of B�npo, more than 6,000 years old discovered in 1953 near Xian and the largest and most complete human settlement so far excavated represents one of the most important sources of information on ancient Chinese writing. Two types of signs appear on red clay pots found there: the simplest ones are probably numerals, while other, more complex ones indicate names of clans and tribes (see page 12).<br> <br>These are the forerunners of the characters as they are known today, even though they anticipate pictographs by several millennia; the latter require a degree of skill and manual dexterity those early Neolithic Chinese appear not to have possessed. The development of Chinese characters can be loosely subdivided into four chronological stages: the primitive period (8000 3000 B.C.), during which man expressed himself first in conventional signs that had a mnemonic function and later in designs that reproduced the world around him: pictographs. The archaic period (3000 c. 1600 B.C.) includes the pre dynastic period and the Xi� dynasty, during which there was a transition from pictographs to ideograms, from direct to indirect symbols, thus filling the gap left by early Chinese man when faced with abstract concepts. The historic period spanned 18 centuries beginning with the Shang or Yin dynasty and ending with the fall of the Eastern H�n (A.D. 220) during which writing completed its evolution and took on its definitive form: the determinative characters and phonetics were born, the main styles were developed and form and meaning were established. Over the centuries that followed, the Chinese merely made use of what had already been invented and codified during the earlier period. Finally we come to the contemporary period, which began in 1949 with the founding of the Peoples Republic of China. This is an important age for the changes made to the writing and structure of characters, the result of a campaign to eradicate illiteracy. These modifications had three main aims: to simplify characters that were difficult but in common use; to achieve a common national pronunciation by means of the Put�nghu� (common language); to be able to transcribe the characters in alphabetical letters in accordance with a system known as Pin yin, that is, combining the sounds with syllables, which gave uniformity to the earlier differences in transliteration. This programme of intensive "alphabetization" has clearly favoured a quantitative rather than qualitative knowledge of the written language, which is regarded as an inalienable part of the Chinese national heritage.<br> <br>The mythological account is altogether more romantic and mysterious. This tells how the notion of progressing from knots tied in a piece of rope to drawings of words and ideas to a quicker and easier graphic sign belongs to the mythical F� Xi, the first of the Five Emperors of the legendary period. Living 5,000 years ago, he is credited with the invention of rope, fishing and hunting nets, musical instruments and the eight trigrams. He taught man how to use fire to cook food and how to raise and tend livestock, becoming the protective deity of nomadic life. Legends clearly pay little heed to archaeology.<br> <br>In a commentary to the <i>Book of Changes</i> (Y� Jing), one of the worlds oldest books, there is a passage that reads as follows: "When F� Xi governed everything under the sky, he looked upward and admired the splendid designs in the heavens, and looking down he observed the structure of the earth. He noted the elegance of the shapes of birds and animals and the balanced variety of their territories. He studied his own body and the distant realities and afterwards invented the eight trigrams in order to be able to reveal the transformations of nature and understand the essence of things." In this way, it was alleged, characters were born.<br> <br>But F� Xi is not alone; Hu�ng Di, who lived 4,700 years ago, is also believed to have been the father of writing. The legendary Yellow Emperor is said to have been given the characters by a dragon that emerged from the waters of the Hu�ng Gh�, the Yellow River. Another legend attributes the invention of the characters to Cang Ji�, a learned minister of the Yellow Emperor. He was struck by the tracks left by animals on the ground, particularly those of birds, whose claw marks gave him the idea for the lines that make up the characters. Two thousand years later, a style of writing was born known as niao zhu�n, bird character. Finally, there is talk of a third claimant, who was given the characters as a token of gratitude by a tortoise saved from drowning. He was the third of the Five Emperors, the Great Yu, founder of the Xi� dynasty (21st 16th century B.C.), the same person who taught man how to channel water and cultivate the land, the patron of farming life.<br> <br> <b>Classification and radical characters</b> <br> <br>Learning how to recognize Chinese characters and how to write them correctly has never been easy. Ancient scribes often filled spaces with incorrect or even invented characters: such lexical monstrosities, the fruits of ignorance or fantasy, cause philologists considerable trouble.<br> <br>In order to put a stop to this, the great emperor Q�n ordered his prime minister Li Si to compile a catalogue of the characters to be used in official documents and literary works. And so the first Chinese dictionary was born, the San Chang, containing 3,300 characters, some of them so called "monster characters" (Ji zi), which were thus assured a place in history. For the first time, the shape and meaning of words were officially defined.<br> <br>Three centuries later, the scholar X� Shen composed the first carefully researched lexicon, complete with definitions and commentaries. Its 15 volumes, published in A.D. 121 under the name Shuo wen jie zi, extended and updated Li Sis dictionary. It was an imposing work that brought the number of characters up to 10,516, grouped under 540 radicals.<br> <br>A further 1,600 years were to elapse before the appearance of another dictionary as innovative and important as X� Shens work. Under the final imperial dynasty, the Qing (1644 1911), the last dictionary of the classical language was compiled. In 1717 the second emperor of the dynasty, Kang Xi (1661 1722), published the Kang Xi zi dian. This dictionary, which bears his name, contains 40,000 characters arranged under 214 radicals, less than half the number in X� Shens lexicon.<br> <br>Finally, in 1967, the Xinhua zi dian (<i>Dictionary of New China</i>) was published, a work that has been used as the basis for many bilingual dictionaries. The radicals were modified and some of them doubled, their number rising to 227; simplified characters were introduced to replace 2,252 others considered "difficult." Although this publication is by no means a literary work, and although many of its points are debatable, it nevertheless marks the first step toward a scientifically modern written language through the establishment of an up to date lexicon. It also marks the first use in transcription of Pin yin, the newest system of transliterating Chinese writing into alphabetical form, which has effectively superseded all earlier methods, the most common of which was the Wade Giles system.<br> <br>The official classification, the most scholarly so far despite its understandable shortcomings will always be that of the Kang Xi period, which is the source of the 214 radicals illustrated in this volume.<br> <br>Having made their first historical appearance in the Shuo w�n, where they numbered 540, and having been reduced to 214 in the Kang Xi and then raised to 227 in modern dictionaries, these radicals hold the key to reading Chinese and give the phonetic compositions their meaning.<br> <br>All the characters are grouped under their radicals. It is the radicals that allow us to locate characters in the dictionary because Chinese, not being an alphabetical language, does not permit the arrangement of words in any alphabetical order: in order to find a character you must first discover the radical from which it is composed. The progressive number that identifies a character refers back to the radical with a list of all its relevant composites. By counting all the strokes that occur in the character, excluding the radical, you will arrive at the subgroup that encompasses the same number of strokes and thence at the character you are seeking. It is not easy, but neither is it impossible.<br> <br>Of the 214 radicals in the Kang Xi, 49 can be written in different ways. For some this is just a matter of slight modification, for others there is a simplified form of script and for one small group there exists a reduced form used in composite characters (see below). The radical therefore serves a dual purpose: it allows a character to be located in the dictionary and, normally, it indicates its meaning.<br> <br>However, the authors decision to illustrate and explain the 214 radicals is not the outcome of any desire to educate his readers but rather to involve them in a game of wits, to lead them down the bizarre yet stimulating road that leads back to the roots of the Chinese language and so to introduce them to its spirit, its philosophy and its riches.<br> <br> <b>Styles of calligraphy</b> <br> <br>Although preserving the basic formal characteristics that allow us to grasp its meaning, every character can be written in a variety of ways. Its appearance is linked to the instrument with which it is written, to the material on which it is inscribed and, above all, to the technical ability and artistic sense of the individual calligrapher. Every Chinese knows that calligraphy is a key to reading the scribe; each character reveals not only the style but also the background, the skill, the mind and the passions of the person who produces it. There are styles with narrow, thick, regular, irregular, intense or light lines; others are squared, fine, elongated, horizontal, soft, stiff or sinuous. All this and more determines calligraphic style. Precisely because they are linked to the personality of the writer, many different styles of calligraphy have emerged over the centuries and still continue to develop today; they represent the individual touch, the artistic genius of certain men. Every Chinese calligrapher must be familiar with, and know how to write in, the six classic styles, aiming to achieve perfection in those which best suit his means and his talent (see below).<br> <br> <b>The Six Families</b> <br> <br>Nobody knows exactly how many Chinese characters there are. The most recent dictionary lists more than 48,000, but it is not a specialist dictionary and thus omits many classical, scientific and technical terms.

By popular demand, a host of delightful sequels followed, some even better than the book that started it all.<br>Dorothy and the Wizard are back in this sequel, and this time it all begins not with a cyclone but with a California earthquake. With her friends Zeb the farm boy, Eureka the kitten, and Jim the cab-horse, Dorothy plummets through a huge crack in the center of the earth.

Soon the teen is flying on the back of a huge bird to a kingdom in another world, where she'll eventually learn that she is destined for a throne. The prominence of a jewel and a sword (as well as purification by water) connects this tale to Japanese tradition. Chinese tradition contributes cosmography and the Mandate of Heaven. Anime tradition guarantees lots of bloody monster-killing by the reluctant (and imperfect) Yoko. This otherworld seems thinly realized, with confusing politics; however, violent action and odd creatures abound. The real-world frame plays a small role, though the fantasy of not really belonging to one's parents is key. Yoko leaves behind her conservative, sexist upbringing, putting on men's clothes and developing muscles, acknowledging the demonic within, and learning to assert herself. Yet, she fears trusting anyone and judges the absence of religion as the reason for people's selfishness. A cynical blue monkey, the heroine's amoral self, regularly suggests suicide. The reading level is not difficult, but names (Keiki, Kaiko, Kyokai, Kou, etc.) are tricky without a guide. Pacing is uneven: stretches of inaction drag on and anticlimax replaces a final confrontation with the forces of evil&#x2014;but six more volumes are planned. Anime fans will be encouraged by the occasional manga-style black-and-white illustration, and the strong female protagonist will attract others to a fantasy with identity and self-acceptance at its core.&#x2014;<i>Patricia D.

Which direction do you go? What&#39;s the creep factor? Robert McCammon, who took the premise of vampires in Los Angeles to its natural conclusion by having half the city turned into vampires and unleashed an Allied werewolf loose on a secret Nazi base, can be counted on to accomplish the task. The raising of the Nazi submarine is central to McCammon&#39;s story which delivers surprising twists and bloody confrontations. The U-boat was sunk off a Caribbean island, but under circumstances that leave it largely intact until a diver accidentally dislodges an unexploded depth charge which lets the sand-covered sub bob to the surface. This could result in a nice sale to museum. But soon, it&#39;s decided the sub would be better off back in the Big Drink. The problem is, see, the crew is not dead, thanks to a voodoo curse.</p><p></p><h2>Judgment of the Witch (Speaks the Nightbird, Vol. 1)</h2><p>In the Carolinas of 1699, a traveling magistrate and his clerk, Matthew, arrive in Fount Royal to hold a trial for an accused witch, a beautiful young woman named Rachel Howarth, a trial that reveals that Fount Royal has become a battleground between good and evil and that not even the innocent are safe.

Breakers were hitting islands or exposed sandbars some distance away from the swamp that he was now negotiating with great difficulty. Ahead of him and almost at the limit of his perception was the midnight traveller -- a dark, moving blotch within further darkness -- who would have been totally lost to him had it not been for the faint orange moonlight, and even that meager illumination was jealously guarded by the streams of moving clouds. </p><p> The man had come this way before, that was a certainty. And more than once. His pace was swift and sure-footed, even without benefit of a lantern. Matthew was up to the task of following through the waist-high grasses and across the muck that pulled at his shoes, but it was a tough and laborious journey. </p><p> They had left Fount Royal far behind. Matthew estimated the distance at least a quarter mile from the watchman's tower, which had been easily circumvented by cutting through the pinewoods. If the watchman had been awake -- and this Matthew seriously doubted -- he'd been looking out to sea. Who would expect anyone in their right mind to venture out into this morass in the dead of night? </p><p> The midnight traveller had a definite purpose, one that gave speed to his step. Matthew heard something rustle off in the grass to his right; it sounded large and quite sinister, therefore he found a little extra speed himself. He discovered in the next moment, however, that his worst enemy was the swamp itself, as he walked into a shallow pond that closed about his knees and almost sent him sprawling. The mud at the pond's bottom seized his shoes and it was only with extreme tenacity that Matthew worked his way to freedom. Once out of the water he realized he could no longer detect his quarry's movement. He scanned from right to left and back again, but the darkness had truly dropped its curtain. </p><p> Still, he knew the man must be going in this general direction. He started off again, more mindful of where he was stepping. The swamp was indeed a treacherous place. The midnight traveller must surely have come out here many times to be able to navigate these dangers. Indeed, Matthew thought the man may have made a map of his route and consigned it to memory. </p><p> After three or four minutes, Matthew was yet unable to spy any movement in the darkness. He glanced back and saw that his course had taken him around a headland. A black line of pines and swamp oaks stood between his current position and the watchman's tower, which was probably the greater part of a mile behind. Beyond him was only more swamp. He debated whether to turn back or forge on. Everything out here was only greater and lesser shades of dark, so what was the point? He did continue on a few paces, though, and again paused to scan the horizon. Mosquitoes hummed about his ears, hungry for blood. Frogs croaked in the rushes. Of another human, however, there was not a sign. </p><p> What was there to bring a person out here? This was wild desolation, hardly a civilized soul standing between his footprints and the city of Charles Town. So what did the midnight traveller seek to accomplish? </p><p> Matthew looked up at the banners of stars. The sky was so huge and the horizon so wide that it was fearsome. The sea, too, was a dark continent. Standing on this coast with the unknown world at his back, he felt more than a little distress, as if his equilibrium and very place on earth were challenged by such immensity. He understood at that moment the need for men to build towns and cities and surround them with walls -- not only to keep out the threat of Indians and wild beasts, but to maintain the illusion of control in a world that was too large to be tamed. </p><p> His contemplation was suddenly broken. Out at sea, two lights blinked in quick succession. </p><p> Matthew had been about to turn his face toward Fount Royal again, but now he stood motionless. A few seconds went by. Then, once again, the two lights blinked. </p><p> What followed next gave his heart a jolt. Not fifty yards from where Matthew was standing, a lighted lantern appeared and was uplifted. The lantern swung back and forth, and then disappeared -- concealed, Matthew suspected, by the midnight traveller's cloak. The man must have either crouched down to strike a match and flame the candle, or done it within the cloak's folds. Whatever and however, a signal had been answered. </p><p> Matthew lowered himself into the protection of the marsh grass, so that just his eyes were above it. He desired a closer view, and began to move quietly and carefully toward where the lantern had been revealed. It came to mind that if he stepped on a venomous reptile in his present posture, its fangs would strike a most valuable area. He got to within thirty feet of the dark-cloaked man and was forced to stop when the cover of the high grass ended. The man was standing on a stretch of hard-packed sand, just a few yards short of the Atlantic's foamy waves. He was waiting, his face aimed toward the ocean and his lantern hidden in the cloak. </p><p> Matthew also waited. Presently, after the passage of perhaps ten minutes during which the man paced back and forth but never left his station, Matthew was aware of a shape emerging from the darkness of the sea. Only when it was about to make landfall did Matthew make out an oarboat, painted either black or dark blue. There were three men aboard, all of whom also wore night-hued clothing. Two of the men jumped out into the surf and pulled the oarboat to shore. </p><p> Matthew realized the boat must have come from a larger vessel some distance away. His thought was: <i>I have found the Spanish spy.</i> </p><p> "Greetin's!" the man who had remained in the oarboat called, his accent as far from being Spanish as Gravesend was from Valencia. He stepped down onto the sand. "How goes it?" </p><p> The midnight traveller answered, but his voice was so low Matthew heard only a murmur. </p><p> "Seven this trip," the oarboater said. "That oughta do you. Get 'em out!" He had delivered this command to the other two men, who began to unload what appeared to be wooden buckets. "Same place?" he asked the midnight traveller, who answered with a nod. "You're a man of habit, ain't you?" </p><p> The midnight traveller raised his lantern from the folds of his cloak and by its yellow glow Matthew saw his face in profile. "A man of <i>good</i> habit," Edward Winston said sternly. "Cease this prattle, bury them, and be done with it!" He dropped the lantern, which had been used to show the other man that he was in no mood for dawdling. </p><p> "All right, all right!" The oarboater reached into the bottom of his craft and brought up two shovels, and then he walked up the beach to the edge of the high grass. His path brought him within fifteen feet of Matthew's concealment. He stopped at a thatch of spiny palmettos. "This where you want 'em?" </p><p> "It will do," Winston said, following. </p><p> "Bring 'em on!" the man ordered his crew. "Hurry it, we ain't got all night!" The buckets, which appeared to be sealed, were carried to the designated place. The oarboater handed the two shovels to the other men, who began to dig into the sand. </p><p> "You know where a third shovel is," Winston said. "You might employ it, Mr. Rawlings." </p><p> "I ain't no damn Injun!" Rawlings replied tartly. "I'm a chief!" </p><p> "I beg to differ. You <i>are</i> an Indian, and your chief is Mr. Danforth. I suggest you earn the coin he's paying you." </p><p> "Very <i>little</i> coin, sir! Very <i>little,</i> for this night work!" </p><p> "The faster they're buried, the sooner you may go." </p><p> "Well, why bury 'em anyway? Who the hell's comin' out here to find 'em?" </p><p> "Safe is better than sorry. Just lay one bucket aside and put the others under with no further argument." </p><p> Muttering beneath his breath, Rawlings reached carefully into the palmettos and pulled out a short-handled shovel that had been hidden there. Matthew watched as Rawlings fell to digging at rhythm with his companions. "What of the witch?" he asked Winston as he worked. "When's she gonna hang?" </p><p> "Not hang. She'll be burned at the stake. I expect it shall be within the next few days." </p><p> "You'll be cooked too then, won't you? You and Danforth both!" </p><p> "Just concern yourself with your digging," Winston said tersely. "You needn't put them deep, but make sure they're well covered." </p><p> "All right! Work on, my lads! We don't want to tarry long in this Satan's country, do we?" </p><p> Winston grunted. "Here or there, it's <i>all</i> Satan's country, isn't it?" He gave the left side of his neck a sound slap, executing some bloodsucking beastie. </p><p> It took only a few moments for a hole to be opened, six buckets secreted within it, and the sand shovelled over them. Rawlings was a master at appearing to work hard, with all the necessary facial contortions and exertions of breath, but his shovel might have been a spoon, for all the sand it moved. When the buckets were laid under, Rawlings stepped back, wiped his brow with his forearm, and said, "Well done, well done!" as if he were congratulating himself. He returned the implement to its hiding place amid the palmettos and grinned broadly at Winston, who stood nearby watching in silence. "I expect this'll be the last trip, then!" </p><p> "I think we should continue one more month," Winston said. </p><p> Rawlings's grin collapsed. "What need will you have of any more, if she's to be burned?" </p><p> "I'll make a need. Tell Mr. Danforth I shall be here at the hour." </p><p> "As you please, your majesty!" Rawlings gave Winston an exaggerated comical bow and the two other men laughed. "Any other communications to the realm?" </p><p> "Our business is concluded." Winston said coldly. He picked up by its wire handle the seventh bucket that had been laid aside, and then he abruptly turned toward Matthew -- who instantly ducked down and pressed himself against the earth -- and began to walk through the grass. </p><p> "I've never seen a burnin' before!" Rawlings called after him. "Make sure you take it all in, so's you can describe it to me!" Winston didn't respond, but kept on walking. His course, Matthew was relieved to see, took him along a diagonal line perhaps ten or twelve feet to Matthew's west. Then Winston had gone past, holding the lantern low under his cloak to shed some light on where he was stepping. Matthew presumed he would extinguish the candle long before he got within view of the watchman's tower. </p><p> "That tight-assed prig! I could lay him out with my little finger!" Rawlings boasted to his companions after Winston had departed. </p><p> "You could lay him out with your bloody <i>breath!"</i> one of the others said, and the third man guffawed. </p><p> "Right you are, at that! Come on, let's cast off this damned shingle! Thank Christ we've got a fair wind for a change tonight!" </p><p> Matthew lifted his head and watched as the men returned to their oarboat. They pushed it off the beach, Rawlings clambered over the side first and then the other men, the oars were taken up -- though not by the big chief -- and the vessel moved out through the lathery surf. It was quickly taken by the darkness. </p><p> Matthew knew that if he waited long enough and kept a sharp enough eye he might see some evidence of a larger craft at anchor out there -- possibly the flare of a match lighting a pipe, or a stain of mooncolor on a billowing sail. He did not, however, have the time or the inclination. Suffice it to know that an oarboat was not a vessel suitable for a sea voyage. </p><p> He looked in the direction Winston had gone, back toward Fount Royal. Satisfied that he was alone, Matthew got up from his defensive posture and immediately went on the offensive. He found the disturbed area beside the palmettos where the buckets had been buried, and -- two painful palmetto-spike stabs later -- gripped his hand on the concealed shovel. </p><p> As Winston had specified, the buckets were not buried very deeply. All Matthew desired was one. The bucket he chose was of common construction, its lid sealed with a coating of dried tar, and of weight Matthew estimated between seven and eight pounds. He used the shovel again to fill the cavity, then returned it to the palmettos and set off for Fount Royal with the bucket in his possession. </p><p> The way back was no less difficult than his previous journey. It came to him that he was most likely locked out of Bidwell's mansion and would have to ring the bell to gain entrance; did he wish to let anyone in the household see him with this bucket in hand? Whatever game Winston was up to, Matthew didn't want to tip the man that his table had been overturned. He trusted Mrs. Nettles to a point, but in his opinion the jury was still out on everyone in the damned town. So: what to do with the bucket? </p><p> He had an idea, but it would mean trusting one person implicitly. Two persons, if Goode's wife should be counted. He was eager to learn the bucket's contents, and most likely Goode would have an implement to force it open. </p><p> With a great degree of thankfulness Matthew put the swamp at his back, negotiated the pinewoods to avoid the watchtower, and shortly thereafter stood before John Goode's door. Upon it he rapped as quietly as he thought possible, though the sound to his ears was alarmingly loud and must have awakened every slave in the quarters. To his chagrin, he had to knock a second time -- and harder -- before a light blotched the window's covering of stretched oilskin cloth. </p><p> The door opened. A candle was pushed out, and above it was Goode's sleepy-eyed face. He'd been prepared to be less than courteous to whoever had come knocking at such an hour, but when he saw first the white skin and then who wore it he put himself together. "Oh...yes suh?" </p><p> "I have something that needs looking at." Matthew held up the bucket. "May I enter?" </p><p> Of course he was not to be denied. "What is it?" May asked from their pallet of a bed as Goode brought Matthew in and closed the door. "Nothin' that concerns you, woman," he said as he lit a second candle from the first. "Go back to sleep, now." She rolled over, pulling a threadbare covering up to her neck. </p><p> Goode put the two candles on the table and Matthew set the bucket down between them. "I followed a certain gentleman out to the swamp just a while ago," Matthew explained. "I won't go into the particulars, but he has more of these buried out there. I want to see what's in it." </p><p> Goode ran his fingers around the tar-sealed lid. He picked up the bucket and turned it so its bottom was in the light. There, burnt by a brand into the wood, was the letter K and beneath that the letters <i>CT.</i> "Maker's mark," he said. "From a cooper in Charles Town, 'pears to be." He looked around for a tool and put his hand on a stout knife. Then he began chipping the tar away as Matthew watched in eager anticipation.

And the recipes will keep you busy (and your friends and family happy) for years to come since we ve included hundreds of easy weeknight dishes (like Skillet Lasagna and One-Pot Chicken and Rice)and company- and holiday-worthy dinners (like Beef Burgundy, Roast Leg of Lamb, and Flourless Chocolate Cake).<br>And with the addition of our Guide to Kitchen Equipment and the America s Test Kitchen Buying Guide this cookbook is even more timely and valuable it s a kitchen essential you can t live without. The Guide to Kitchen Equipment identifies which basic equipment and tools you need and shows you how to use and care for them properly. The Buying Guide, organized by category in a handy, illustrated chart, gives home cooks an invaluable, at-a-glance summary of our testing of core kitchen equipment; it is easy to tell which features we think are important (and why), along with any other details that matter. And of course we give you the name of the test kitchen s favorite brands, the ones that made it to the top in our rigorous testing process. This proprietary information will be invaluable to home cooks looking for the most value for their dollar. Plus, having the right equipment on hand makes anyone a more efficient and successful cook.</p><p>Over time, twin enterprises <i>Cook's Illustrated</i> magazine and America's Test Kitchen have published many books dedicated to providing exhaustively tested recipes--"best" versions of traditional dishes plus definitive takes on kitchen equipment and ingredients. Some series readers have complained of endlessly recycled or rejiggered recipes; others take each book at face value, finding the formulas and cooking insights good and helpful. America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook, which calls itself a cookbook, cooking school, and kitchen reference in one, offers over 1,200 approachable recipes for a very wide range of dishes--from "weekday" fare like Creamy Rice Casserole, Cheesy Nachos with Spicy Beef, and Skillet Lasagna, to dressier recipes, including Pan-Seared Lamb Chops with Red Wine Rosemary Sauce, Roasted Trout Stuffed with Bacon and Spinach, and Chocolate Marshmallow Mousse. There are "specialty" chapters devoted to sandwiches, drinks, and slow cooker and pressure cooker dishes; a grilling section is a tutorial in itself. <p> Unorthodox, "better-way" approaches abound. For example, a fried chicken formula instructs the cook to wet the bird's dry coating slightly before it's applied for an extra-crunchy crust. Predictably, side bars feature equipment and ingredient evaluations, on bottled salsa, for example; "good food/bad food" photographs show readers what to aim for when producing fare like holiday cookies; and there are tips, charts, and "Cooking 101" sidebars galore. Step-by-step photos offer more direction still. </p><p> Though the majority of recipes are sound and yield tempting results, readers poring through the book will note gaffes and curiosities. The recipe for poached eggs, for example, offers the option of extra cooking for "firm yolks" (hard-boiled poached eggs, anyone?) and hamburgers receive an indentation before cooking to avoid "puffy" domed burgers, a novel problem that could, in any case, be solved by proper shaping. The addition of sugar to some savory dishes--for example, a pan sauce for steak--is misguided. Readers should also know that the book, which comes in loose-leaf form, requires some assembly, and that the pages themselves are quite thin, making them vulnerable to spills and tearing in daily kitchen use. </p><p> These things said, the book delivers solid, family-friendly dishes with enough fully orchestrated "how- to" to make even novice cooks feel secure when tackling the basics or more ambitious fare. </p><p> <b>What's New in the Revised Editon?</b><br> First out in 2005, <i>America&#x2019;s Test Kitchen Family Cookbook</i> was praised for its recipe ease, inclusiveness, and wealth of helpful information, but was also criticized for its physical production. A loose-leaf book with its pages included separately, readers found it inconvenient to assemble and its paper impractically thin. The revised edition is printed on heavier stock, and arrives with its pages already on its rings (there are two more now, for sturdiness) with only chapter dividers to insert, a simple task. </p><p> In addition, new inside front and back covers provide information on emergency substitutions, roasting guidelines, equivalent measures, and more--and a "Light Recipes" chapter has been included. Without defining precisely what "light" means--fewer fats and carbs, or a combo?--the section offers attractive all-course recipes, such as turkey chili, veggie burgers, meat and cheese lasagna, and chocolate bundt cake. Some readers will welcome the "slimming" of familiar dishes while others will find some of the manipulations--using cornstarch to thicken the sauce in fettuccine alfredo or ricotta to add body to a reduced-fat pesto, for example--unappealing. The book, however, remains a valuable kitchen tool--and one with greater convenience and durability than before. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i> </p> <br> <p><b>Exclusive Recipe Excerpts from <i>The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook (Revised Edition)</i></b> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br>Butternut Squash Soup </p></td> <td><br>Light Chicken Parmesan </td> <td><br>Classic Apple Pie</td></tr></tbody></table> <p></p> <b>More from America's Test Kitchen</b> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <p><br> <i>The Best of America's Test Kitchen 2007</i> </p> </td> <td><br> <i>Cook's Illustrated</i> </td><td><br> <i>The Best 30-Minute Recipe</i> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>The America's Test Kitchen Guarantee: Recipes that work . . . the first time and every time. <p>We know how frustrating it can be when things go wrong in the kitchen.

Sadly, when women grow up, they are taught to be tough, efficient, and independent. Many Christian women are tired, struggling under the weight of the pressure to be a "good servant," a nurturing caregiver, passionate lover, or capable home manager.</p><p>What the <em>Wild at Heart Field Manual</em> did for men, the <em>Captivating: A Guided Journal</em> can do for women. By revealing the three distinctly female desires every woman shares, John and Stasi Eldredge invite participants to recover their feminine hearts, which may have suffered many wounds but were originally defined in the image of a passionate God.</p></p><p>John Eldredge is a bestselling author, a counselor, and a teacher. He is also president of Ransomed Heart, a ministry devoted to helping people discover the heart of God, recover their own hearts in God&#39;s love, and learn to live in God&#39;s kingdom. John and his wife, Stasi, live near Colorado Springs, Colorado. Stasi Eldredge is a New York Times bestselling author, and her books have sold nearly 3 million copies and changed women&#39;s lives all over the world.

She and her family make their home in Colorado Springs, Colorado.<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Now we are on holy ground.</p> <p> Writing a book for men (<em>Wild at Heart</em>) was a fairly straightforward proposition. Not that men are simpletons. But they <em>are</em> the less complicated of the two genders trying to navigate love and life together. Both men and women know this to be true. The mystery of the feminine heart was meant to be a good thing, by the way. A source of joy. Yet it has become a source of shame--women almost universally feel that they are "too much" and "not what they should be." And men tend to pull away from the deeper waters of a woman's soul, unsure of what they will find there or how to handle it. And so we have missed the treasure that is the heart of a woman, missed the richness femininity was meant to bring to our lives, missed the way it speaks to us of the heart of God.</p> <p>Rest assured--this is not a book about all the things you are failing to do as a woman. We're tired of those books. As a new Christian, the first book I (Stasi) picked up to read on godly femininity I threw across the room. I never picked it up again. In the twenty-five years since, I have only read a few I could wholeheartedly recommend. The rest drive me crazy. Their messages to women make me feel as though, "You are not the woman you ought to be--but if you do the following ten things, you can make the grade." They are, by and large, soul-killing. But femininity cannot be prescribed in a formula.</p> <p>We have women friends who love tea parties and china, and friends who break out in hives at the thought of them. We have women friends who love to hunt, bow hunt even. Women who love to entertain and women who don't. Women who are professors, moms, doctors, nurses, missionaries, dentists, homemakers, therapists, chefs, artists, poets, rock climbers, triathletes, secretaries, salespeople, and social workers. Beautiful women, all.</p> <p>So--is a true woman Cinderella or Joan of Arc? Mary Magdalene or Oprah? How do we recover essential femininity without falling into stereotypes, or worse, ushering in more pressure and shame upon our readers? That is the last thing a woman needs. And yet, there <em>is</em> an essence that God has given to every woman. We share something deep and true, down in our hearts. So we venture into this exploration of femininity by way of the <em>heart</em>. What is at the core of a woman's heart? What are her desires? What did we long for as little girls? What do we still long for as women? And, how does a woman begin to be healed from the wounds and tragedies of her life?</p> <p>Sometime between the dreams of your youth and yesterday, something precious has been lost. And that treasure is your heart, your priceless feminine heart. God has set within you a femininity that is powerful and tender, fierce and alluring. No doubt it has been misunderstood. Surely it has been assaulted. But it is there, your true heart, and it is worth recovering. You <em>are</em> captivating.</p> <p>So we invite you to take a journey with us, a journey of discovery and healing. For your heart is the prize of God's Kingdom, and Jesus has come to win you back for himself--all of you. We pray that God will use this book in your life, in your heart, to bring healing, restoration, joy, and life! And if God does that, it will be cause for a wonderful celebration. With teacups and china. Or paper plates. Whatever. One day, we will all celebrate together. In anticipation and hope, may this little book draw you closer to God's heart--and your own. </p> <p> <strong>CHAPTER ONE<br> The Heart of a Woman</strong></p> <p> <em>Sometimes it's hard to be a woman.</em><br> --TAMMY WYNETTE</p> <p> <em>He saw that Fatima's eyes were filled with tears.<br> "You're crying?"<br> "I'm a woman of the desert," she said, averting her face.<br> "But above all, I'm a woman."</em><br> --PAULO COELHO</p> <p> <em>You belong among the wildflowers<br> You belong in a boat out at sea<br> You belong with your love on your arm<br> You belong somewhere you feel free.</em><br> --TOM PETTY</p> <p>Let's do it." Dusk was settling in. The air was cool, fragrant with pine and sage, and the swiftly moving river beckoned. We were camping in the Tetons, and it so happened that our canoe was on top of the car. "Let's put in." John looked at me as if I had lost my mind. In less than twenty minutes night would be upon us and the river and the woods. All would be pitch black. We'd be on the river, alone, with only a general idea of which way to go (down), where to take out (head for the road), and a long walk back to the car. Who knew what dangers lay out there? He looked again at me, looked at our young sons, and then said, "Okay!" We sprang into action.</p> <p>The evening was stunning. The river's graceful movements caused the water's colors to shift from cobalt to silver to black. No other person was in sight. We had Oxbow Bend to ourselves. In record time we had the canoe in the river, life vests securely fastened, paddles at the ready, boys installed, and off we went, a race to drink as deeply of as much beauty as possible, together.</p> <p>An old wooden bridge hung low across the river, its broken remains looked as though they would collapse at the next strong breeze. We had to duck to pass underneath. Carefully, we navigated the winding channels of the Snake-John in back, me in front, our three boys in between full of wonder and delight. As the stars began to come out, we were like the children present at the creation of Narnia--the sky so clear, the stars so close. We held our breath as one fell slowly, slowly across the sky and disappeared.</p> <p>A beaver slapped the river, the sound like a rifle shot, frightening two ducks into flight, but all we could see between the darkened water and sky were the white ripples of their wake, like synchronized water-skiers. Owls began their nightly calls in the woods above, joined by sandhill cranes along the shore. The sounds were familiar, yet otherworldly. We whispered to one another about each new wonder, as the paddles dipped almost but not quite silently in and out of the water.</p> <p>Night fell. Time to take out. We planned to go ashore along a cove closest to the road, so we wouldn't have to walk too far to find our car. We didn't dare try to take out where we had put in . . . that would require paddling against the current with little ability to see where we were going.</p> <p>As we drifted towards the bank a bull moose rose from the tall grasses, exactly where we had planned to come ashore. He was as dark as the night; we could see him only because he was silhouetted against the sky, jagged mountains behind. He was huge. He was gorgeous. He was in the way. Blocking the only exit we had. More people are killed in national parks by moose than by any other animal. Remarkable speed, 1,700 pounds of muscle and antlers, and total unpredictability make them dangerous indeed. It would take about two seconds for him to hit the water running and capsize our canoe. We could not pass.</p> <p>The mood changed. John and I were worried now. There was only one alternative to this way out, now closed to us, and that was paddling back up river in what had become total darkness. Silently, soberly, we turned the canoe and headed up, searching for the right channel that would keep us out of the main current. We hadn't planned on the adventure taking that turn but suddenly, everything was required. John must steer with skill; I must paddle with strength. One mistake on our part and the strong current would force the canoe broadside, fill it, and sweep our boys off downriver into the night.</p> <p>It was glorious. </p> <p>We did it. He did. I did. We rose to the challenge working together, and the fact that it required all of me, that I was in it with my family and for my family, that I was surrounded by wild, shimmering beauty and it was, well, kind of <em>dangerous</em> made the time . . . transcendent. I was no longer Stasi. I was Sacagawea, Indian Princess of the West, a valiant and strong woman.</p> <p> <strong>A WOMAN' S JOURNEY</strong></p> <p> <em>Then the time came when the risk it took<br> To remain tight in a bud was more painful<br> Than the risk it took to blossom.</em><br> --ANAIS NIN</p> <p> I'm trying to remember when I first knew in my heart that I was no longer a girl, but had become a woman. Was it when I graduated from high school, or college? Did I know it when I married? When I became a mother? I am forty-five years old as I write this, but there remain places in my heart that still feel so very young. As I think back on what would be considered rites of passage in my life, I understand why my journey has felt so unguided, uncertain. The<br> day I started my period, my family embarrassed me at the dinner table by breaking out in song, "This girl is a woman, now . . ." Hmmmm. I didn't <em>feel</em> any different. All I felt was mortified that they <em>knew</em>. I stared at my plate, suddenly fascinated by corn.</p> <p>The day I got my first bra, a training bra, the kind with stretchy material over the front, one of my sisters pulled me into the hallway where, to my horror, my father stood at the ready to take my picture. They said I would laugh about it later. (I haven't.) Like so many other women I was left alone to navigate my way through adolescence, through my changing and awakening body, a picture of my changing and awakening heart. No counsel was given for the journey into womanhood. I <em>was</em> encouraged, however, to eat less. My father pulled me aside and told me, "No boy will love you if you're fat."</p> <p>I joined the feminist movement in college, searching, as so many women did in the '70s, for a sense of self. I actually became director of the Women's Resource Center at a liberal state university in California. But no matter how much I asserted my strength and independenc...</p></p><h2>Major Pettigrew&#39;s Last Stand</h2><p>You are about to travel to Edgecombe St. Mary, a small village in the English countryside filled with rolling hills, thatched cottages, and a cast of characters both hilariously original and as familiar as the members of your own family. Among them is Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), the unlikely hero of Helen Simonson's wondrous debut. Wry, courtly, opinionated, and completely endearing, Major Pettigrew is one of the most indelible characters in contemporary fiction, and from the very first page of this remarkable novel he will steal your heart.<br>The Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have lived by for generations: honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup of tea. But then his brother's death sparks an unexpected friendship with Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more. But village society insists on embracing him as the quintessential local and her as the permanent foreigner. Can their relationship survive the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the face of culture and tradition?<b> </b></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2010</strong>: In her witty and wise debut novel, newcomer Helen Simonson introduces the unforgettable character of the widower Major Ernest Pettigrew.&nbsp; The Major epitomizes the Englishman with the "stiff upper lip," who clings to traditional values and has tried (in vain) to pass these along to his yuppie son, Roger. The story centers around Pettigrew's fight to keep his greedy relatives (including his son) from selling a valuable family heirloom--a pair of hunting rifles that symbolizes much of what he stands for, or at least what he thinks he does. The embattled hero discovers an unexpected ally and source of consolation in his neighbor, the Pakistani shopkeeper Jasmina Ali. On the surface, Pettigrew and Ali's backgrounds and life experiences couldn't be more different, but they discover that they have the most important things in common. This wry, yet optimistic comedy of manners with a romantic twist will appeal to grown-up readers of both sexes. Kudos to Helen Simonson, who distinguishes herself with <em>Major Pettigrew's Last Stand</em> as a writer with the narrative range, stylistic chops, and poise of a veteran. <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em><br>Helen Simonson was born in England and spent her teenage years in a small village in East Sussex. A graduate of the London School of Economics and former travel advertising executive, she has lived in America for the last two decades.

A little odd, and a little too easy, but&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinsey took Alvin Limardo's retainer check anyway. It&nbsp;&nbsp;turned out to be as phony as he was. In real life,&nbsp;&nbsp;his name was John Daggett, a chronic drunk with a&nbsp;&nbsp;record as long as your arm and a reputation for&nbsp;&nbsp;sleazy deals. But he wasn't just a deadbeat. By the&nbsp;&nbsp;time Kinsey caught up with him, he was a dead body&nbsp;&nbsp;-- with a whole host of people who were delighted&nbsp;&nbsp;to hear the news. But how do you make a stiff pay&nbsp;&nbsp;up what he owes you?</p><p>"Bright, brisk and thoroughly engaging." -- <i>The Washington Post</i>.<b>Sue Grafton</b> entered the mystery field in 1982 with the publication of <i>'A' Is for Alibi</i>, which introduced female hard-boiled private investigator, Kinsey Millhone, operating out of the fictional town of Santa Teresa, (aka Santa Barbara) California. <i>'B' is for Burglar</i> followed in 1985 and the series, now referred to as 'the alphabet' mysteries, is still going strong. In addition to her books, she&#x2019;s published several Kinsey Millhone short stories, and with her husband, Steven Humphrey, has written numerous movies for television, including &#x201c;A Killer in the Family&#x201d; (starring Robert Mitchum), &#x201c;Love on the Run&#x201d; (starring Alec Baldwin and Stephanie Zimbalist) and two Agatha Christie adaptations, &#x201c;Sparkling Cyanide&#x201d; and &#x201c;Caribbean Mystery,&#x201d; which starred Helen Hayes.

But when Shevlin rides back to Rafter Crossing to uncover the truth, he finds that the quiet ranching community has become a booming mining town. Newfound wealth has not made Rafter a peaceful place, however, and the smell of fear and greed is thick in the air. As Mike Shevlin tries to unravel the mystery of Patterson&#39;s death, he is led deeper and deeper into a conspiracy that controls not only the fate of Rafter Crossing but the heart of a beautiful but tormented young woman-and Shevlin&#39;s own destiny.</p><p>Rafter Crossing was a town building for an explosion when Mike Shevlin rode in. The cattlemen swore they&#39;d close down the mines because they were poisoning the range water. The miners were stealing the high-grade ore that rightfully belonged to Laine Tennison. Laine hired Mike Shevlin to get her ore back. He had an old debt he wanted to pay back... but with lead, not gold!Louis L&#x2019;Amour is undoubtedly the bestselling frontier novelist of all time. He is the only American-born author in history to receive both the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of his life's work.

Tired to the bone, the two groups laid down the last of countless wooden ties, bought at the exorbitant cost of six dollars apiece, and thus joined two great rail lines, the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific, to form a single transcontinental route. That rail line made possible the mass settlement of the West, and, as those who conceived it well knew, it changed the course of American history.<p> David Haward Bain's superb narrative of westward rail history, weighing in at 800 pages, ends not with this great achievement but with the political and financial scandal that would almost overshadow it. Along the way Bain looks closely at the entrepreneurial men who foresaw the possibilities of a vast nation joined by a steel ribbon--most memorably the hit-and-miss businessman Asa Whitney, who proposed to Congress an ingenious scheme to fund the building of the railroad through commercializing the right of way. Some of the men who came after Whitney, such as Mark Hopkins, Collis Huntington, and Leland Stanford, amassed great fortunes in realizing this dream. Others died penniless and nearly forgotten in the wake of political maneuverings and bad deals. Bain's vigorous, well-written narrative does much to restore those overlooked actors to history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Beginning in 1842 with a visionary&#39;s dream to span the continent with twin bands of iron, Empire Express captures three dramatic decades in which the United States effectively doubled in size, fought three wars, and began to discover a new national identity. From self-made entrepreneurs such as the Union Pacific&#39;s Thomas Durant and the Central Pacific&#39;s Collis Huntington, to era-defining figures such as President Lincoln, Generals Grant and Sherman, Mark Twain, and Walt Whitman, to the thousands of nameless laborers -- especially the Irish and Chines -- whose backbreaking work made the railroad possible, this extraordinary narrative summons an astonishing array of voices to give new dimension, not only to this monumental endeavor, but also to the culture, political struggles, and social conflicts of an unforgettable period in American history.</p><h2>Desert Solitaire</h2><p>DESERT SOLITAIRE is the story of the author&#39;s experiences during three seasons as ranger in charge of the Arches National Monument, a 33,000 acre preserve in Utah&#39;s high desert. Like Thoreau before him, Abbey reflects on the happiness a man can find within himself, particularly when alone in the wild. Unlike WALDEN, Abbey&#39;s book is concerned with wilderness preservation, and he goes after the spoilers with energy. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</p><p>With language as colorful as a Canyonlands sunset and a perspective as pointed as a prickly pear, Cactus Ed captures the heat, mystery, and surprising bounty of desert life. <i>Desert Solitaire</i> is a meditation on the stark landscapes of the red-rock West, a passionate vote for wilderness, and a howling lament for the commercialization of the American outback.The year before I began working at Random House, I took a roadtrip with a friend from college. One night we spent sleeping under the stars on the side of the road, about one-hundred feet from the edge of the Grand Canyon. That night has stayed present for me. And so when I saw the deep desert reds and the striking blue sky of the cover of DESERT SOLITAIRE sitting in the office, I had no choice but to pick it up. Riding through the insides of Manhattan, tunneling through to work, I have been carrying this book with me. I keep closing my eyes and hearing the wolf call, the swish of the wind through the brush and seeing the great vast distances, feeling the heat of the day on my skin and the dry cool descent of desert night. In reading this book I am coming to a whole new understanding of the ecology of the desert west. Edward Abbey went alone to the desert as a seeker of a greater knowledge of himself, but also to dwell in a nature unfiltered, unpersonified, on its own terms. The desert is bigger than any of us, filled with intimate moments.

An indispensable book, The 33 Strategies of War provides all the psychological ammunition you need to overcome patterns of failure and forever gain the upper hand.</p><p><b>Robert Greene</b> has a degree in classical studies and is the author of several bestselling books, including <i>The 48 Laws of Power, The 33 Strategies of War</i>, <i>The Art of Seduction</i>, and <i>Mastery</i>. He lives in Los Angeles.<br><br><b>Joost Elffers</b> is the packaging genius behind Viking Studio's Secret Language series, <i>Play with Your Food</i>, and <i>How Are You Peeling?</i>. He lives in New York City.The classical scholar and author says that war occurs in five contexts--when we execute it individually, with an army of some kind, from an offensive position, from a defensive position, and through unconventional, or dirty, means. The suggestions and ideas behind this lesson are thoroughly illustrated with concise historical vignettes. Deftly balancing theory and practice, the author asks listeners to examine their options for handling conflict, understand the meaning of their past experiences, and commit themselves fully to a mature and appropriate response to conflict. He has an impressive understanding of the psychological and organizational challenges in warfare. Don Leslie gives a softly intimate reading that sounds aptly erudite but not overly intense. Pacing himself steadily, he organizes the thick sentences and dense ideas with finesse.

Inspired by a brief passage in Melville's <em>Moby-Dick,</em> where Captain Ahab speaks passionately of his young wife on Nantucket, Una Spenser's moving tale "is very much Naslund's own and can be enjoyed independently of its source." <em>(Newsday) </em><p>The daughter of a tyrannical father, Una leaves the violent Kentucky frontier for the peace of a New England lighthouse island, where she simultaneously falls in love with two young men. Disguised as a boy, she earns a berth on a whaling ship where she encounters the power of nature, death, and madness, and gets her first glimpse of Captain Ahab. As Naslund portrays Una's love for the tragically driven Ahab, she magnificently renders a real, living marriage and offers a new perspective on the American experience. Immediately immersed in this world, the reader experiences a brilliantly written, vibrant, uplifting novel--a bright book of life. </p><p><em>Ahab's Wife</em> was a main selection of the Book of the Month Club, chosen by <em>Time</em> magazine as one of the top five novels of 1999, selected by Book Sense as one of the top five books of the year, chosen by the <em>New York Times</em> as a Notable Book of 1999, and chosen as a Best Book by <em>Publishers Weekly</em>.</p><p><em>Ahab's Wife</em> is being reprinted in Australia and England, translated into German, Hebrew, Spanish and Portuguese.</p></p><p>It has been said that one can see farther only by standing on the shoulders of giants. <i>Ahab's Wife</i>, Sena Naslund's epic work of historical fiction, honors that aphorism, using Herman Melville's <i> Moby-Dick</i> as looking glass into early-19th-century America. Through the eye of an outsider, a woman, she suggests that New England life was broader and richer than Melville's manly world of men, ships, and whales. This ambitious novel pays tribute to Melville, creating heroines from his lesser characters, and to America's literary heritage in general. <p> Una, named for the heroine of Edmund Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i>, flees to the New England coast from Kentucky to escape her father's puritanism and to pursue a more exalted life. She gets whaling out of her system early: going to sea at 16 disguised as a boy, Una has her ship sunk by her own monstrous whale, and survives a harrowing shipwreck: </p><blockquote> I was so horrified by the whale's deliberate charge that I could not move. Then my own name flew up from below like a spear: "Una!" Giles' voice broke my trance, and I scrambled down the rigging. No sooner did my foot touch the deck than there was such a lurch that I fell to my face. I heard and felt the boards break below the waterline, the copper sheathing nothing but decorative foil. The whole ship shuddered. A death throe. </blockquote> The ship dies, but Una returns to land to pursue the life of the mind. The novel's opening line--"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last"--also diminishes Melville's hero in the broader scheme of things. Naslund exposes the reader to the unsung, real-life heroes of Melville's world, including Margaret Fuller and her Boston salon, and Nantucket astronomer Maria Mitchell. There is a chance meeting with a veiled Nathaniel Hawthorne in the woods, and throughout the novel the story brims with references to the giants of literature: Shakespeare, Goethe, Coleridge, Keats, and Wordsworth. Although her novel runs long at nearly 700 pages, Naslund has created an imaginative, entertaining, and very impressive work. <i>--Ted Leventhal</i><p>Sena Jeter Naslund is a cofounder and program director of the Spalding University (Louisville) brief-residency MFA in Writing, where she edits <em>The Louisville Review</em> and Fleur-de-Lis Press.

Building a house would entail no more work than planting a seed in the ground. These scenarios may seem far-fetched, but pioneering geneticist George Church and science writer Ed Regis show that synthetic biology is bringing us ever closer to making such visions a reality.&nbsp;In <i>Regenesis</i>, Church and Regis explore the possibilities&#x2014;and perils&#x2014;of the emerging field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology, in which living organisms are selectively altered by modifying substantial portions of their genomes, allows for the creation of entirely new species of organisms. Until now, nature has been the exclusive arbiter of life, death, and evolution; with synthetic biology, we now have the potential to write our own biological future. Indeed, as Church and Regis show, it even enables us to revisit crucial points in the evolution of life and, through synthetic biological techniques, choose different paths from those nature originally took.&nbsp;Such exploits will involve far more than just microbial tinkering. Full-blown genomic engineering will make possible incredible feats, from resurrecting woolly mammoths and other extinct organisms to creating mirror life forms with a molecular structure the opposite of our own. These technologies&#x2014;far from the out-of-control nightmare depicted in science fiction&#x2014;have the power to improve human and animal health, increase our intelligence, enhance our memory, and even extend our life span.&nbsp;A breathtaking look at the potential of this world-changing technology, <i>Regenesis</i> is nothing less than a guide to the future of life.<br></p><p><b>George Church</b> is Professor of Genetics at the Harvard Medical School and member of the Wyss Institute of Biologically Inspired Engineering.

At thirty, the author was at Bill Clinton's side during the presidential campaign of 1992, &amp; for the next five years he was rarely more than a step away from the president &amp; his other advisers at every important moment of the first term. What Liar's Poker did to Wall Street, this book will do to politics. It is an irreverent &amp; intimate portrait of how the nation's weighty business is conducted by people whose egos &amp; idiosyncrasies are no sturdier than anyone else's. Including sharp portraits of the Clintons, Al Gore, Dick Morris, Colin Powell, &amp; scores of others, as well as candid &amp; revelatory accounts of the famous debacles &amp; triumphs of an administration that constantly went over the top, All Too Human is, like its author, a brilliant combination of pragmatic insight &amp; idealism. It is destined to be the most important &amp; enduring book to come out of the Clinton administration.</p><p>A Rhodes scholar with a healthy ego, the young idealist George Stephanopoulos thought he was ready for the obscure governor of Arkansas. But soon after he signed on as his presidential-campaign manager, the odds of Clinton's triumph soared, and so did the chance for calamity via Gennifer Flowers and other scandals. Stephanopoulos scrambled behind the scenes, squelching rumors, spinning major news organizations, artfully knifing Clinton rivals, and second-guessing public opinion--lessons that would serve him well when Clinton won.<p> For the next four years, Stephanopoulos was a few feet from the president, advising him on everything from Iraq and Waco to gays in the military and Paula Jones. More than any book yet--including Monica Lewinsky's--Stephanopoulos's memoir reveals what went on in the scary, occasionally hilarious world backstage at the White House. He casts stark light on characters from Yeltsin, "like a boiled potato slathered in sour cream," to the author's nemesis Dick Morris, whom he depicts bellowing for Clinton to bomb Bosnia. And nobody who's talking knows as well as Stephanopoulos the most passionate, mystifying affair of all, between Bill and Hillary.</p><p> But years of backroom scheming, screaming, and relentless political attacks took a toll. Stephanopoulos's face erupted in hives; he grew a beard. Slammed by clinical depression, he dangerously delayed medical attention, fearing the story might leak. This memoir could've been titled <i>Prisoner of Spin</i>. Written with the jittery cadence of a bookie, <i>All Too Human</i> is a lively look at the complex and motley cast of characters who rule the world. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>George Stephanopoulos is currently a visiting professor at Columbia University.</p><h2>The Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence</h2><p>As elegant as his bestselling <b>How to Know God</b> and as practical as his phenomenal <b>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</b>, this groundbreaking new book from Deepak Chopra contains a dramatic premise: Not only are everyday coincidences meaningful, they actually provide us with glimpses of the field of infinite possibilities that lies at the heart of all things. By gaining access to this wellspring of creation, we can literally rewrite our destinies in any way we wish.<br><br>From this realm of pure potential we are connected to everything that exists and everything that is yet to come. &#x201c;Coincidences&#x201d; can then be recognized as containing precious clues about particular facets of our lives that require our attention. As you become more aware of coincidences and their meanings, you begin to connect more and more with the underlying field of infinite possibilities. This is when the magic begins. This is when you achieve the spontaneous fulfillment of desire.<br><br>At a time when world events may leave us feeling especially insignificant and vulnerable, Deepak Chopra restores our awareness of the awesome powers within us. And through specific principles and exercises he provides the tools with which to create the magnificent, miraculous life that is our birthright.</p><p>Deepak Chopra&#x2019;s many books have become international bestsellers and classics of their kind. <br>Dr. Chopra is founder of the Chopra Center for Well Being in Carlsbad, California.Matter, Mind, and Spirit<br><br>From the moment we become aware of the world around us, we begin to wonder about our place within it. The questions we ask are timeless: Why am I here? How do I fit into the scheme of things? What is my destiny? As children, we tend to think of the future as a clean sheet of paper upon which we can write our own stories. The possibilities seem endless, and we are energized by the promise of discovery and the sheer pleasure of living immersed in so much potential. But as we grow up, become adults, and are "educated" about our limitations, our view of the future becomes constricted. What once lifted our imaginations now weighs us down with dread and anxiety. What once felt boundless becomes narrow and dark.<br><br>There is a way to regain the soaring joy of unlimited potential. All that is required is an understanding of the true nature of reality, a willingness to recognize the interrelatedness and inseparability of all things. Then, aided by specific techniques, you will find the world opening up to you, and the good luck and opportunities that popped up every once in a while will occur more and more frequently. How powerful is synchrodestiny? Imagine for a moment that you find yourself with a flashlight in your hand in a room that is totally dark. You turn on the flashlight and see a beautiful painting hanging on the wall. You might think, "Sure, this is a wonderful work of art, but is this all there is?" Then, all at once, the room becomes illuminated from above. You look around and see that you are in an art museum, with hundreds of paintings on the walls around you, each more beautiful than the last. As these possibilities stand revealed to you, you realize you have a lifetime of art to study and love. You are no longer constrained to view just one painting lit by the weak glow of your flashlight.<br><br>This is the promise of synchrodestiny. It turns on the lights. It gives us the ability to make real decisions instead of blind guesses as we move forward in our lives. It allows us to see meaning in the world, to understand the connectedness or synchronicity of all things, to choose the kind of life we want to live, and to fulfill our spiritual journey. With synchrodestiny, we gain the ability to transform our lives according to our intentions.<br><br>The first step to living this way is to understand the nature of the three levels of existence.<br>Level 1:<br>THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN<br><br>The first level of existence is physical or material, the visible universe. This is the world we know best, what we call the real world. It contains matter and objects with firm boundaries, everything that is three-dimensional, and it includes everything we experience with our five senses--all that we can see, hear, feel, taste, or smell. It includes our bodies, the wind, the earth, water, gases, animals, microbes, molecules, and the pages of this book. In the physical domain time seems to flow in a line so straight that we call it the arrow of time, from the past to the present to the future. This means that everything in the physical domain has a beginning, a middle, and an end, and is therefore impermanent. Sentient beings are born and die. Mountains soar from the molten core of the earth and are brought low again by the relentless scouring of rain and wind.<br><br>The physical world as we experience it is governed by immutable laws of cause and effect, so that everything is predictable. Newtonian physics allows us to predict action and reaction, so that when billiard balls hit each other with a particular speed and at a particular angle, we can anticipate exactly what route each will travel across the billiards table. Scientists can calculate precisely when a solar eclipse will occur and how long it will last. All of our "commonsense" understanding of the world comes from what we know of this physical domain.<br>Level 2:<br>THE QUANTUM DOMAIN<br><br>At the second level of existence everything consists of information and energy. This is called the quantum domain. Everything at this level is insubstantial, meaning that it cannot be touched or perceived by any of the five senses. Your mind, your thoughts, your ego, the part of you that you typically think of as your "self" are all part of the quantum domain. These things have no solidity, and yet you know your self and your thoughts to be real. Although it is easiest to think of the quantum domain in terms of mind, it encompasses much more. In fact, everything in the visible universe is a manifestation of the energy and information of the quantum domain. The material world is a subset of the quantum world.<br><br>Another way of stating this is that everything in the physical domain is made up of information and energy. In Einstein's famous equation, E = MC2, we learn that energy (E) equals mass (M) times the speed of light (C) squared. This tells us that matter (mass) and energy are the same thing only in different forms--energy equals mass.<br><br>One of the first science lessons taught in school is that every solid object is made up of molecules, and molecules are made up of even smaller units called atoms. We come to understand that this seemingly solid chair we are sitting on is made up of atoms so small that they cannot be seen without the aid of a powerful microscope. Later in the lesson we learn that tiny atoms are made up of subatomic particles, which have no solidity at all. They are, quite literally, packets or waves of information and energy. This means that, at this second level of existence, the chair you are sitting in is nothing but energy and information.<br><br>This concept can be difficult to grasp at first. How can invisible waves of energy and information be experienced as a solid object? The answer is that events in the quantum domain occur at the speed of light, and at that speed our senses simply cannot process everything that contributes to our perceptual experience. We perceive objects as being different from one to the next because energy waves contain different kinds of information, which are determined by the frequency or vibration of those energy waves. It's like listening to the radio. A radio tuned to one station, say 101.5 FM, might play only classical music. Change to a slightly different frequency of radio waves by tuning in to, say, 101.9 FM, and you might hear only rock and roll. Energy is coded for different information depending on how it vibrates.<br><br>So the physical world, the world of objects and matter, is made up of nothing but information contained in energy vibrating at different frequencies. The reason we don't see the world as a huge web of energy is that it is vibrating far too fast. Our senses, because they function so slowly, are able to register only chunks of this energy and activity, and these clusters of information become "the chair," "my body," "water," and every other physical object in the visible universe.<br><br>This is similar to what happens when we watch a movie. As you know, a motion picture is made up of individual photographic frames with gaps in between frames. If you looked at a movie film on the reel in a projection room, you would see the individual frames and gaps. But when we watch the movie itself, the frames are strung together and played back so fast that our senses no longer observe the frames as discontinuous. Instead, we perceive a steady stream of information.<br><br>At the quantum level, the various chunks of energy fields vibrating at different frequencies that we perceive as solid objects are all part of a collective energy field. If we were capable of perceiving everything that was happening at the quantum level, we would see that we are all part of a great "energy soup," and everything--each one of us and all the objects in the physical domain--is just a cluster of energy floating in this energy soup. At any given moment your energy field will come into contact with and affect everyone else's energy field, and each of us responds in some way to that experience. We are all expressions of this communal energy and information. Sometimes we can actually feel this connectedness. This sensation is usually very subtle, but on occasion it becomes more tangible. Most of us have had the experience of walking into a room and sensing "tension so thick you could cut it with a knife," or of being in a church or holy shrine and being engulfed by a sense of peace. That is the collective energy of the environment mingling with your own energy, which you register on some level.<br><br>In the physical domain we are also constantly exchanging energy and information. Imagine that you are standing on the street and you smell cigarette smoke from someone walking a block away. This means you are inhaling the breath of that person about one hundred yards away. The smell is just a tracer notifying you that you are inhaling someone else's breath. If the tracer wasn't there, if the person walking by wasn't smoking, you would still be inhaling that person's breath; you just wouldn't know it without cigarette smoke to alert you. And what is breath? It is the carbon dioxide and oxygen that come from the metabolism of every cell in that stranger's body. That is what you are inhaling, just as other people are inhaling your breath. So we are all constantly exchanging bits of ourselves--physical, measurable molecules from our bodies.<br>At a deeper level, there is really no boundary between our selves and everything else in the world. When you touch an object, it feels solid, as though there was a distinct boundary between it and you. Physicists would say that we experience that boundary as solid because everything is made up of atoms, and the solidity is the sense of atoms bumping against atoms. But consider what an atom is. An atom has a little nucleus with a large cloud of electrons around it. There is no rigid outer shell, just an electron cloud. To visualize this, imagine a peanut in the middle of a football stadium. The peanut represents the nucleus, and the stadium represents the size of the electron cloud around the nucleus. When we touch an object, we perceive solidity when the clouds of electrons meet. That is our interpretation of solidity, given the sensitivity (or relative insensitivity) of our senses. Our eyes are programmed to see objects as three-dimensional and solid. Our nerve endings are programmed to feel objects as three-dimensional and solid. In the reality of the quantum domain, however, there is no solidity. Is there solidity when two clouds meet? No. They meld and separate. Something similar happens whenever you touch another object. Your energy fields (and electron clouds) meet, small portions meld, and then you separate. Although you perceive yourself to be whole, you have lost a bit of your energy field to the object, and have gained a bit of its energy field in return. With every encounter, we exchange information and energy, and we come away changed just a little bit. In this way, too, we can see how connected we are to everything else in the physical world. We are all constantly sharing portions of our energy fields, so all of us, at this quantum level, at the level of our minds and our "selves," are all connected. We are all correlated with one another.<br><br>So it is only in our consciousness that our limited senses create a solid world out of pure energy and information. But what if we could see into the quantum domain--if we had "quantum eyes"? In the quantum domain, we would see that everything we think of as solid in the physical world is actually flickering in and out of an infinite void at the speed of light. Just like the frame-and-gap sequence of a motion picture, the universe is an on-off phenomenon. The continuity and solidity of the world exists only in the imagination, fed by senses that cannot discern the waves of energy and information that make up the quantum level of existence. In reality, we are all flickering in and out of existence all the time. If we could fine-tune our senses, we could actually see the gaps in our existence. We are here, and then not here, and then here again. The sense of continuity is held only by our memories.<br><br>There is an analogy that illustrates this point. Scientists know that it takes a snail about three seconds to register light. So imagine that a snail was watching me, and that I left the room, robbed a bank, and came back in three seconds. As far as the snail was concerned, I never left the room. I could take her to court and she would provide a perfect alibi. For the snail, the time that I was gone from the room would fall into one of those gaps between the frames of flickering existence. Her sense of continuity, assuming snails have one, would simply not register the gap.<br><br>So the sensory experience of all living beings is a purely artificial perceptual construct created in the imagination. There is a Zen story in which two monks are looking at a flag that is waving in the wind. The first one says, "The flag is waving." The second one says, "No, the wind is moving." Their teacher comes over and they pose him the question. "Who's right? I say the flag is moving. He says the wind is moving." The teacher says, "You are both wrong. Only consciousness is moving." As consciousness moves, it imagines the world into existence.<br><br>So the mind is a field of energy and information. Every idea is also energy and information. You have imagined your physical body and the whole physical world into existence by perceiving energy soup as distinct physical entities. But where does the mind responsible for this imagination come from?<br>Level 3:<br>THE NONLOCAL DOMAIN<br><br>The third level of existence consists of intelligence, or consciousness. This can be called the virtual domain, the spiritual domain, the field of potential, the universal being, or nonlocal intelligence. This is where information and energy emerge from a sea of possibilities. The most fundamental, basic level of nature is not material; it is not even energy and information soup; it is pure potential. This level of nonlocal reality operates beyond the reach of space and time, which simply do not exist at this level. We call it nonlocal because it cannot be confined by a location--it is not "in" you or "out there." It simply is.</p><h2>The Greatest Player Who Never Lived: A Golf Story</h2><p><p>Unwritten in the annals of the sporting world is the story of a man with unlimited potential who was denied his rightful place in the lore of golf His story had remained a mystery for so many years, yet it wasnt a mystery at all, since he had long been forgotten. It is a story that may never have been told had Charley Hunter not accepted a summer internship at Butler &amp; Yates, a prestigious Atlanta law firm. Bobby Jones, the legendary amateur golfer, had once been a partner at the firm and his old legal files had been severely neglected over the years. The task of cataloging these files soon presents the young law student with much more than he anticipated. Charley learns quickly that there is a compelling tale buried within the files of Bobby Jones.</p></p><p>With very few exceptions--think Dan Jenkins's <i>Dead Solid Perfect</i> and Steven Pressfield's <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i>--golf's most notable fictions are generally consigned to the imaginative mathematics that weekend duffers jot down on their scorecards. Consider <i>The Greatest Player Who Never Lived</i> a truly rare birdie then. It's a thrilling golf novel that not only captures the game, but transcends it.<p> J. Michael Veron's engaging fantasy begins when young law student Charley Hunter accepts a summer internship at the Atlanta law firm in which the great Bobby Jones was once a partner. Assigned to catalog Jones's dusty files, Hunter comes upon an intriguing correspondence that hints at an extraordinary story. True to his name, Hunter then sets out to learn the truth behind the unlikely exchange of letters between Jones, golf's erudite and nonpareil pillar, and a semiliterate phenom named Beau Stedman, who, on the verge of golfing greatness in the early '30s, disappeared under the cloud of a murder charge. With Jones's secret help and support, Beau manages to survive. A fugitive determined to honor his golfing destiny, he emerges here and there to play the greatest golfers of the era. Hunter isn't satisfied just with uncovering Beau's past, though; his obsession turns into a search for Beau's present, with unexpected complications.</p><p> The novel is filled with lots of good golf, and with good writing about golf's enigmatic hold on those captivated by the game. But Veron, a Harvard-educated lawyer, aims beyond golf here--and holes it. In <i>Player</i>, he's crafted a solid legal thriller that smartly confronts issues of character, truth, justice, and guilt, which are, of course, pretty much the same issues every golfer confronts the moment he or she steps up to the first tee. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Hunter goes to work as a summer intern at a prestigious Atlanta law firm, he has no idea that his passion for golf will come into play on the job. Stumbling onto a yellowed file containing correspondence between Beau Stedman, an astonishingly talented teenage golfer, and the legendary Bobby Jones (once a partner at the firm), Hunter finds himself embroiled in a decades-old murder case&#x2013;and searching for an invisible champion who won nearly all his matches with the masters.<br><br>As Hunter unravels the facts of Stedman&#x2019;s case, his hunger for the truth is matched only by his deepening reverence for the game, one that leads him to a heart-stopping courtroom showdown between golf&#x2019;s most powerful association and a family torn apart by buried secrets.<br></p><h2>Pulling Through</h2><p>DOOMSDAY.

The first spread is a close-up of Rocket running through the grass. Lowercase, hand-lettered words identify "dog, tail, paw, ear, spot, nose," and "stick." Next, a series of verbs including "wag, dig, melt, run, sniff," and "nap" appear illustrated with the humorous poses fans of the series have come to love-snout in air, tail a blur-Hills knows dogs. Two spreads of a wood-framed blackboard with white-chalk-labeled illustrations are also included. These pictures represent random common objects such as foods, animals, household items, a car, and a robot. One page offers a close-up of the little bird, another has four evocative thumbnails of the dog labeled "mud, wind, snow," and "moon." Another spread introduces opposites with owl "up" and Rocket "down" or his tail the only indication that he is "in" a hollow log as opposed to "out." Lying cozily in the grass, the eager student listens to a story with a pile of books nearby. The final spread, "Small words that will come in handy," is a bit confusing as it features abstract sight words like "also, had, since, about," and "very" that babies or toddlers might not grasp. Still, the signature oil and colored pencil illustrations are colorful and charming, and the message that books and words are important is certainly a worthy one.

It was easily the most affluent town in both counties; the homes of Harrows were larger, often constructed of stately stone, some with as many as ten bedrooms. The garden yards were as wide as the fabled Trail itself, some roofs as high as the willows. Even better: Harrows enjoyed more sunlight than the other towns, as the shadows cast by the arching of those willows concluded where the wheat fields began, just south of the border. Sunny and secluded, remote and rich, Harrows was a very desirable place to live.<br><br>But that didn&#x2019;t preclude its citizens from dying.<br><br>John Bowie found this out the bad way.<br><br>&#x201c;One of a kind,&#x201d; Carol Evers said, standing beside her husband, Dwight, looking into the open grave of her friend John Bowie.

Many times.<br><br>Though famous for a healthy sense of humor, John wasn&#x2019;t one to take such a statement lightly. And Carol&#x2019;s green eyes often betrayed when she was serious.<br><br>Tell me, he&#x2019;d said, his boots resting upon a wooden stool, his body hunched in a wicker chair. It was Carol&#x2019;s favorite posture he assumed. Perhaps that was what loosened her lips. Tell me about every single time.<br><br>And Carol did tell John Bowie about every time she&#x2019;d died, every time she could remember. The doctors, she said, had no name for her condition. But she&#x2019;d come up with one of her own many years ago.<br><br>Howltown, she&#x2019;d said. That&#x2019;s what I started calling it around age eight. I guess I was influenced by the names of the Trail-�towns. The only places I knew of. And it is something of a town. To me. No sheriff, of course. No boardwalk, no bank, no booze. No nothing. But it&#x2019;s a place, here on the Trail, all the same. Even if I&#x2019;m the only one who visits. She&#x2019;d paused. John noticed an odd combination of expressions on her face; Carol was both recalling her youth, when she named her coma, and despairing that it still existed. To someone outside the coma, she continued, I appear&nbsp;. . . dead. Hardly a heartbeat. Far from fogging a mirror. And a pulse as slow as a slug. There&#x2019;s no light in there, John. I can hear the world around me, but I can&#x2019;t move. And the wind in there&nbsp;. . . it howls. So&nbsp;. . . Howltown. Pretty neat, huh?<br><br>She told John how afraid she once was of the isolation of the coma. How her mother Hattie&#x2019;s constant tinkering in the workroom acted as an anchor to reality. Without Hattie, I&#x2019;d have broken in there. Gone mad.<br><br>She told him of the hoarse breathing that acted as music in Howltown. And how Hattie said it must be Carol&#x2019;s own. She told John about the falling sensation, too.<br><br>From the second it starts, I&#x2019;m falling. I fall into the coma and I don&#x2019;t touch ground until I wake.<br><br>John could see the relief in the face of his brilliant friend as she spoke. Carol, John knew, hadn&#x2019;t told anybody but Dwight. She was embarrassed over it, he surmised, convinced that her condition would be considered a burden and send most running. Carol had intimated that someone had run from her before. John listened closely and had ideas of his own. And as he spoke Carol realized why she had suddenly decided to confide in someone other than her husband. It wasn&#x2019;t only for safety&#x2019;s sake, though that played a major part, for what if Dwight were to die while Carol was inside the coma? Who would know that she still lived?<br><br>But telling John Bowie had just as much to do with Carol&#x2019;s desire to hear what he thought of it.<br><br>John had many things to say. John was as bright as Howltown was dark.<br><br>And now John Bowie was dead.<br><br>Lying barefoot in a gray suit on the bumpy dirt six feet beneath Carol&#x2019;s yellow shoes, John had been taken by the Illness, knew his death was afoot, and had asked for no box. Carol herself had seen to it that her naturalist friend, Harrows&#x2019;s resident pantheist, would decay the way he wanted to.<br><br>Directly into the dirt.<br><br>&#x201c;He looks a bit like he&nbsp;. . . fell right into the hole,&#x201d; Dwight whispered to Carol, the couple shoulder-�to-�shoulder. Carol&#x2019;s yellow dress flapped in a breeze that didn&#x2019;t seem to reach her husband&#x2019;s black suit.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s what he wanted,&#x201d; Carol whispered. And her voice sounded much older than the thirty-�eight years she was.<br><br>The funeral director Robert Manders stood at a podium at the head of Bowie&#x2019;s grave, telling the grievers what they already knew. &#x201c;A brilliant mind, an enthusiast, a thirst for knowledge in all subjects&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br><br>Carol thought of John performing simple magic tricks at parties. Making olives vanish. Pulling plums from the ears of drunk women. She tried to smile but couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to do it.<br><br>&#x201c;In the end,&#x201d; Dwight whispered, &#x201c;no magic trick can save you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s sad,&#x201d; Dwight said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br><br>You two have as much in common as I do with a ladies&#x2019; man, John once told Carol. You know he married you for your money, right?<br><br>But Carol hadn&#x2019;t liked that joke and told him as much.<br><br>Dwight nodded across the grave to his colleague Lafayette. Carol caught the gesture. Of all the people Dwight associated with, the woman Lafayette was perhaps the least likable. Her gut hung proudly over her black belt and tested the silver buttons of her white wool shirt. A cemetery wind toyed with her long ponytail, sending it flapping across the deep wrinkles in her face. She&#x2019;d always looked something like a witch to Carol, and Carol couldn&#x2019;t imagine a single sentence that might&#x2019;ve been exchanged between the pompous, dubious prig and the amazing man John Bowie who lay barefoot in his gray suit on his back below.<br><br>Perhaps self-�conscious of the unboxed man, conservative Manders concluded his eulogy more quickly than Carol expected. Then again, Bowie&#x2019;s entire life had concluded more quickly than Carol expected. The Illness, she knew, was something to be scared of. Yet for a woman who had died many times, Carol was perhaps less afraid than most.<br><br>&#x201c;Hell&#x2019;s heaven,&#x201d; Dwight said. &#x201c;I can hardly stomach this.&#x201d;<br><br>Carol brought her lips close to her husband&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;Dwight. Shut up.&#x201d;<br><br>It was no secret Dwight had as little in common with John as did the witch Lafayette. Normally this bothered Carol deeply. How was it she&#x2019;d married a man who didn&#x2019;t see the shine in her brilliant, favorite friend? How was it John couldn&#x2019;t make Dwight laugh? How was it&#x2014;�<br><br>But today was no day to be upset with Dwight.<br><br>And yet the couple were on hard times indeed.<br><br>It&#x2019;s because he doesn&#x2019;t ask questions like I do, John once said. Carol could almost hear his voice now. He&#x2019;s more bull than man, and that&#x2019;s coming from a friend with a lot of turkey in him.<br><br>John was always making jokes. But more important, always making Carol laugh.<br><br>She looked to his lips just as the gravediggers Lucas and Hank shoveled dirt upon his chest and chin. Then, with her mind&#x2019;s ear, Carol heard him say something he had never actually said while living. Something he would probably say now if he could.<br><br>Who else are you gonna tell now? Someone needs to know. What if you slipped into the coma right now and Dwight somehow died while you were in there? You need a safety valve, Carol. Security. I&#x2019;m gone now. Do my ghost and the ghost of your mother a favor: Tell someone else.<br><br>&#x201c;We need to tell someone else,&#x201d; Carol suddenly whispered. Dwight turned to face her.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell someone else what?&#x201d;<br><br>As Manders closed his book of notes, as Lucas and Hank covered Bowie&#x2019;s head completely, Carol closed her eyes and repeated herself. &#x201c;We need to tell someone else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, dear,&#x201d; Dwight said, tugging her elbow as the other grievers started to move from the graveside. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s discuss this at home.&#x201d;<br><br>But did Dwight know what she meant? She couldn&#x2019;t be sure. And why not? Her mother, Hattie, would&#x2019;ve known. Hattie would already be sawing the pieces for her plan B. John would&#x2019;ve known, too.<br><br>Dwight nodded a good day to Lafayette and led Carol to the cemetery grass. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Carol began walking toward their coach.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he repeated.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it? A good friend has died. That&#x2019;s what it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My heart is as heavy as yours,&#x201d; Dwight said, catching up.<br><br>Though Carol hated to hear it, John was often right about Dwight. And recently Dwight had changed. Ten, five, even three years ago he would be holding her hand, an arm draped over her shoulders, discussing the very topic she wanted him to address.<br><br>John Bowie was dead. Someone else needed to know about Howltown.<br><br>And yet talking about her condition was one of the hardest things for Carol Evers to do.<br><br>She had been spurned before.<br><br>Inside the coach she spoke her mind. And the argument began.<br><br>&#x201c;Now nobody knows,&#x201d; she said, juggling the sorrow of losing John and the fear of being vulnerable once more.<br><br>&#x201c;Knows what, dear?&#x201d; Dwight looked as lost as a wolf cub with no pack.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m talking about my condition.&#x201d;<br><br>Dwight nodded. But Carol couldn&#x2019;t tell what the nod meant.<br><br>&#x201c;And now nobody knows,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Someone other than you needs to. If not&nbsp;. . . there&#x2019;s a very real risk of my being mishandled.&#x201d;<br><br>Dwight laughed.<br><br>Carol, stunned, sat up straighter. &#x201c;Why are you laughing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are the chances, Carol? What are the chances that you&#x2019;d slip into a coma right now, and that I would then drop dead while you were inside?&#x201d;<br><br>The way he said it, Carol felt a little embarrassed for being so angry. And yet&nbsp;. . .<br><br>&#x201c;If there&#x2019;s one thing Hattie taught me, it was not to waste a second when it comes to this. We need to tell someone. A doctor can&#x2019;t even detect a pulse when I&#x2019;m in there. And hell&#x2019;s heaven, Dwight, you should have brought this up yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Carol. Who do you want to tell?&#x201d;<br><br>Carol heard the distant echo of hoarse breathing. Or perhaps it was the actual horses taking them home.<br><br>&#x201c;Farrah.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The maid girl?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I agree. You tell her and everybody&#x2019;s going to know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s you who keeps it secret. I&#x2019;m just thinking of you, dear.&#x201d;<br><br>But he wasn&#x2019;t. Carol could tell.<br><br>&#x201c;Farrah is perfect,&#x201d; Carol said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s bright. She&#x2019;s kind. And she&#x2019;s close.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her husband, Clyde, is a drunk. Loose lips.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well then, that&#x2019;s how it will be. And everybody will know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you&nbsp;. . . are you sure?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She thought of John Bowie. Whereas Hattie thought it wise to keep it a secret (they&#x2019;ll take advantage of you, Carol, men from the Trail), John encouraged her to let everyone in: In the end, people are kinder than you think, Carol. Even the ones you thought were not. &#x201c;Yes. I&#x2019;m absolutely sure.&#x201d;<br><br>But Dwight could tell she wasn&#x2019;t. Carol had suggested others before.<br><br>As the coach rolled rocky over stones in the road, Dwight adopted a more serious posture. He placed a hand upon hers.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you&nbsp;. . . feel it coming on?&#x201d;<br><br>Some of the steam of the argument was released. Dwight sounded concerned after all.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>They rode in silence with this between them: the knowledge that Dwight believed her comas were caused by stress. Her many adamant refutations that they were not.<br><br>She&#x2019;d gone under when Hattie died, yes, but she&#x2019;d also gone many times when, it appeared, life was fine.</p><h2>An Invitation to Indian Cooking</h2><p>This new paperback of Madhur Jaffrey&#39;s modern culinary classic is the companion to &#34;Eastern Vegetarian Cooking&#34;: it will come as a revelation to all those whose experience of Indian cuisine has been confined to restaurants in Britain.

With stories covering all aspects of the Clone Wars - from the trials of the revered Jedi Master Yoda, to the tribulations of the lowliest Clone Troopers fighting on the front lines, to the wicked machinations of the dreaded Count Dooku and General Grievous - these fast-paced tales feature a unique look into the world of Star Wars and at the events that shook the galaxy far, far away...</p><p>The digest-sized <i>Clone Wars Adventures</i> takes the <i>Clone Wars</i> animated TV series as its base for a selection of all-new stories. The art by the Fillbach Brothers (Matt and Shawn) follows the simple style of the cartoons, and the stories, while inconsequential to the grander <i>Star Wars</i> universe, are usually entertaining. The most interesting of the four stories in the book are the first, in which Asajj Ventress and Durge battle General Grievous, and the second, in which a squad of clone troopers takes to the streets of Ord Mantell to intercept a crucial Separatist delivery. At fewer than 100 pages and with minimal dialogue, <i>Clone Wars Adventures</i> is best suited to young readers or fans who are looking for a quick pickup and put-down. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p><h2>Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps War Vol. 01 TP</h2><p>Sinestro -- Hal Jordan&#39;s former mentor and arch-nemesis -- has gathered an army of soldiers fueled by the fear they instill in others, consisting of Arkillo, Karu-Sil, the Cyborg-Superman, and hundreds more of the most terrifying villains the universe has ever seen!

In this tapestry of poetic and religious scholarship, Graves explores the stories behind the earliest of European deities�&#x20ac;&#x201d;the White Goddess of Birth, Love, and Death�&#x20ac;&#x201d;who was worshipped under countless titles. He also uncovers the obscure and mysterious power of "pure poetry" and its peculiar and mythic language.<br></p><p>Robert Graves, the late British poet and novelist, was also known for his studies of the mythological and psychological sources of poetry. With <i>The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth</i>, Graves was able to combine many of his passions into one work. While the book is so poetically written that many of the passages amount to prose poems, it is also frequently plot driven enough to feel like a novel, and it is rich with scholarly insight into the deep wells of poetry. Especially fascinating is the chapter in which Graves explores the ancient and ongoing practice of poets' invoking the muse. Graves details the practice in both the Eastern and Western literary traditions, and shows specific similarities and differences among Greek, British, and Irish tales and myths about the muse. Graves has much to offer students of history and myth, but poetry lovers will also be fascinated with <i>The White Goddess</i>.<b>Robert Graves</b> (1895-1985), born in London, was one of the most talented, colorful, and prolific men of letters in the twentieth century. He is best known for his historical novels,<i> I, Claudius</i> and <i>Claudius the God</i>.

Damn the men who had tormented the new recruit with what they had said was his cowardice. They might have thought they were teasing him, teaching him to stand up for himself, but Richards was barely seventeen. It was too soon&#x2014;only a couple of months ago he had been a school boy! Now he was a soldier in the Flanders trenches, with a rifle in his hands.<br><br>Jack rounded the bend in the trench, keeping his head low. But Richards was nowhere in sight along this stretch. He was not among the men sitting on the duckboards, smoking their Woodbines, reading letters from home, making bad jokes. They knew how to hide their fear. Richards didn&#x2019;t, not yet. He was frightened out of his wits, deafened by the noise of gunfire, sick with the smell of death clogging his senses, and above all trying to do the right thing, trying to belong.<br><br>Jack Barrick was a veteran; he was twenty-three and had been here since the beginning, two years ago, at the end of that blazing hot summer of 1914. Home by Christmas, they had said. Over a million casualties later, it looked as if they would be here forever. Some of them really would be, God help them. Buried in the Flanders clay. What is forever when you are seventeen and the average life expectancy is a matter of weeks?<br><br>But Jack was not going to lose Richards because some irresponsible idiot had made him think he was a coward and not fit to be one of them.<br><br>Everything was quiet now, Jerry must be taking a nap! Jack&#x2019;s feet rattled on the duckboards. Think! Where would Richards go? Where would he feel safe? Double back to the supply trench. Jack went down the connecting trench, still keeping low. A careless hand&#x2014;or worse, head&#x2014;could still attract a sniper&#x2019;s bullet.<br><br>Jack asked everyone he passed if they had seen Richards. No one had. But then he encountered a worried-looking sergeant far too concerned with his own problems to listen to anyone else&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah! Captain Barrick,&#x201d; said the man as he grabbed Jack&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;You seen anyone come this way carrying a gas canister? Probably had it wrapped up in something. Could look like anything&#x2014;clothes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You missing one?&#x201d; Jack caught his alarm. Gas was everyone&#x2019;s nightmare. Ever since it had first been used at Ypres last year, the thick, poisonous fumes haunted them all, worse than drowning in the mud, or being caught on the barbed wire, riddled with bullets. Equal, maybe, to the sapper&#x2019;s fear of being trapped in the endless tunnels beneath no-man&#x2019;s-land in a flood or a cave-in, slowly crushed, unable to breathe. Jack knew that fear personally. He was a sapper himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the sergeant admitted. &#x201c;Saw a young soldier hanging around, you can always tell the latest lot. The fear in their eyes that isn&#x2019;t quite the thousand-yard stare, but you know that if they live, it will be. He could have taken it; stupid little sod might not realize what it is.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack felt a knot tighten in his chest. &#x201c;About my height, fair hair? Seventeen?&#x201d;<br><br>There was no relief in the sergeant&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Yes. That&#x2019;s him.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack wanted to doubt, but the sick certainty inside him left no room. &#x201c;Which way did he go?&#x201d; he asked, although he knew already.<br><br>&#x201c;Toward the front.&#x201d; The sergeant indicated the front line, and no-man&#x2019;s-land and the German lines beyond. &#x201c;Do you know him? Where&#x2019;s he gone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just lost, I hope,&#x201d; Jack said fervently. &#x201c;Please God&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The sergeant still had hold of Jack&#x2019;s arm. His grip tightened. &#x201c;Lost? You want the poor little devil lost? What&#x2019;s wrong with you, man?&#x201d; He was almost shouting.<br><br>Jack freed his arm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping he&#x2019;s wandering around trying to think what to do. Or better still, how to get the gas back without anyone knowing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m afraid I know where he&#x2019;s going&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where? God in heaven!&#x201d; The sergeant&#x2019;s face was white now. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not going to gas those stupid gits who were teasing him, is he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No . . . I think he&#x2019;s hoping to prove his courage by going into the tunnels and letting the gas out . . . on the other side.&#x201d; Jack remembered the taunts he&#x2019;d heard and some hare-brained idea that gas in the German lines would decimate them the same way they had decimated us. Only nobody had the guts to take it there. It was just stupid talk.<br><br>But Richards had heard it. He had even asked where the entrances to the tunnels were from this side. No one had answered him. It was a carefully guarded secret. Only the sappers went down there, new men, and the remnants of those who had dug them. Sappers&#x2019; casualty rates were high. It was something Jack knew but refused to think of.<br><br>The sergeant was staring at him. &#x201c;What do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Keep quiet for the moment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You going after him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Would it . . . would it be so bad if he put a gas canister in their trenches for a change?&#x201d;<br><br>Jack closed his eyes to conceal his fury. &#x201c;It would be very bad indeed, Sergeant,&#x201d; he answered quietly. &#x201c;Our trenches are a little lower than theirs. Slope of the land. And we dug a bit deeper. It gives us an advantage in some ways. The friable topsoil where they are tends to collapse more easily. Ours is more clay, thicker, less likely to give way. And wetter, of course. Water finds its own level&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know all that,&#x201d; the sergeant interrupted.<br><br>Jack opened his eyes. &#x201c;Do you also know that the gas is heavier than air? That it finds the lowest level it can? It will start off in their tunnels and then seep into ours&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Through the earth?&#x201d; The sergeant&#x2019;s disbelief was thick in his voice&#x2014;doubt, mockery.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Jack said patiently. &#x201c;Through the places where the tunnels come close to one another. Through the walls that are so thin in places, we can hear them talking to one another as if there were just a piece of plaster board between us and them. Sometimes we accidentally break into one of their tunnels, or they do into one of ours. If he lets the gas go in one of theirs, you can bet your last penny it will end up in ours, too. Would you like to be trapped underground in a dark, narrow tunnel where you have to stoop to miss hitting the roof and carry a lantern to see where you are going&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no light underground, Sergeant. Absolutely none at all. Then smell gas? Would you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, sweet Jesus.&#x201d; The sergeant crossed himself, his face pasty white.<br><br>&#x201c;So which way did he go?&#x201d; Jack repeated.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not . . . going down there after him? You can&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m just going to let it happen,&#x201d; Jack snapped. He could not bear to think about it and then do it. He could do it only if he thought about something else.<br><br>The sergeant grunted without saying anything else.<br><br>Jack went straight to the camouflaged entrance of the nearest tunnel. To his mind, it seemed the most likely one for Richards to have found. Although the thought that the boy had stumbled across it so quickly was worrying. It was obviously not as well hidden as he had believed. Something to pay attention to another time.<br><br>He pulled back the sacking over the entrance and went in, letting it fall back into place after him, concealing it again. He shone his lantern ahead of him. The corridor was long and low, rising at the end until the way forward became invisible. His eyes would get used to it. He breathed in slowly. Even now, the smell of wet earth almost suffocated him. It brought back too many memories, going far into his childhood and time spent with his father down the coal mines of Durham County, in the mining village where Jack was born. He could remember the huge, ragged wind-torn skies, the endless views from the moors, and place names that haunted you, like Pity Me.

Conventional wisdom calls it incurable, but renowned Dr. Gabriel Cousens counters that claim with this breakthrough book. <i>There Is a Cure for Diabetes</i> lays out a three-week plan for reversing the negative genetic expression of diabetes to a physiology of health and well-being. Dr. Cousens&#x2019;s method, widely tested at his famous Tree of Life centers, is to reset the DNA through green juice fasting and a 100% organic, nutrient-dense, vegan, low-glycemic, low-insulin-scoring, and high-mineral diet of living foods in the first twenty-one days. Both practical and inspirational, the book explains how to abandon the widespread &#x201c;culture of death&#x201d;&#x2013;symbolized by addictive junk food&#x2013;that fosters diabetes in favor of a more natural, nurturing approach. The program renders insulin and related medicines unnecessary <i>within four days </i>as the blood sugar drops to normal levels; and the diabetic shifts into a non-diabetic physiology within two weeks. The third week focuses on live-food preparation, featuring 100 delicious raw recipes. Dr. Cousens emphasizes regular consultations, monitoring blood chemistries, and emotional support, and includes a one-year support program to help maintain a diabetes-free life.</p><p>"There Is a Cure for Diabetes" presents a breakthrough concept of reversing the negative genetic expression of diabetes to a physiology of health and well-being. This is accomplished by resetting the genetic expression of a person's DNA through green juice fasting and a 100 per cent organic, nutrient-dense, vegan, low-glycemic, low-insulin-scoring, and high-mineral diet of living foods in the first 21 days. Regardless of how long people have been on insulin, this approach usually frees them from insulin and all other anti-diabetic medications within four days. Fasting blood sugars often go below 100 in two weeks, which means a person has essentially shifted into a non-diabetic physiology.In the third week, training in live-food preparation is provided including 100 delicious, low-glycemic, and low-insulin-scoring recipes. The 21-Day Program also provides a psycho-spiritual course to help those suffering from diabetes free themselves from the myth that it is incurable. They are freed from their comfort zone in the "culture of death" lifestyle: high white sugar and high cooked, trans-fatty acid intake with its concomitant life of denying junk food and addictive habits.Diabetes is a symptom of the culture of death.<p></p>The focus and power of success of the programme is helping people transform their consciousness to one invested in the culture of life. The one-year support programme is key to client success; even though one may be experiencing the joy of being healthy, the pressures and convenience of our conventional culture take time to overcome, and people need time to become stabilized in this new way of life. In addition, such problems as obesity, heart disease, kidney disease, and neuropathy often take months to reverse.Gabriel Cousens, MD, MD(H), DD, is a holistic medical doctor, best-selling author, and founder-director of the Tree of Life Foundation and Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center in Patagonia, Arizona.

The text is sprinkled with lots of colorful illustrations and quizzes geared to letting readers assess their own behavior.

The Manners Guide for Girls</i> (1997), with bouncy new illustrations. Clear, straightforward information covers introductions, sleepovers, special occasions, gifts, table manners, hosts and guests, and more. Mingus' cheery, multiethnic characters have a touch of anime and a little bit of the PowerPuff Girls about them, and brightly colored sidebars and display fonts blend in well. The cell phone advice is excellent, though more about online etiquette and the use of iPods, gaming, and other e-toys would have made this a stronger book. A good place to go for readers not quite ready for Miss Manners herself. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

General Tom Franks embodies those qualities: strength, experience, a keen mind, energy, honor, good humor, and a deep loyalty to his troops and to his country. <p></p><p>"Tom Franks is truly a soldier's soldier."</p><p>-- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld</p></blockquote><p></p><p> The Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command from July 2000 through July 2003, General Tommy Franks made history by leading American and Coalition forces to victory in Afghanistan and Iraq -- the decisive battles that launched the war on terrorism. </p><p> In this riveting memoir, General Franks retraces his journey from a small-town boyhood in Oklahoma and Midland, Texas, through a lifetime of military service -- including his heroic tour as an Artillery officer in Vietnam, where he was wounded three times. A reform-minded Cold War commander and a shrewd tactician during Operation Desert Storm, Franks took command of CENTCOM at the dawn of what he calls a "crease in history" -- becoming the senior American military officer in the most dangerous region on earth. </p><p> Now, drawing on his own recollections and military records declassified for this book, Franks offers the first true insider's account of the war on terrorism that has changed the world since September 11, 2001. He puts you in the Operations Center for the launch of Operation Enduring Freedom just weeks after 9/11, capturing its uncertain early days and the historic victory that followed. He traces his relationship with the demanding Donald Rumsfeld, as early tensions over the pace of the campaign gave way to a strong and friendly collaboration. </p><p> When President Bush focused world attention on the threat of Iraq, Franks seized the moment to implement a bold new vision of joint warfare in planning Operation Iraqi Freedom. Rejecting Desert Storm&#x2013;style massive troop deployment in favor of flexibility and speed, Franks was questioned by the defense establishment -- including Secretary of State Colin Powell. Yet his vision was proven on the ground: Within three weeks, Baghdad had fallen.</p><p><em>American Soldier</em> is filled with revelation. Franks describes the covert diplomacy that helped him secure international cooperation for the war, and reveals the role of foreign leaders -- and a critical double agent code-named "April Fool" -- in the most successful military deception since D-Day in 1944. He speaks frankly of intelligence shortcomings that endangered our troops, and of the credible WMD threats -- including eleventh-hour warnings from Arab leaders -- that influenced every planning decision. He offers an unvarnished portrait of the "disruptive and divisive" Washington bureaucracy, and&nbsp;a candid assessment&nbsp;of the war's aftermath. Yet in the end, as <em>American Soldier</em> demonstrates, the battles in Afghanistan and Iraq remain heroic victories -- wars of liberation won by troops whose valor was "unequalled," Franks writes, "by anything in the annals of war." </p><p>Few individuals have the chance to contribute so much of themselves to the American story as General Tommy Franks. In <em>American Soldier</em>, he captures it all. </p></p><p>As Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command from July 2000 through July 2003, Tommy Franks led the American and Coalition forces to victory in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Unsurprisingly, the portions of <i>American Soldier</i> covering these wars are the most interesting because they combine military maneuvers, political wrangling, and lots of action and commentary. This does not mean, however, that the rest of his autobiography is dull. General Franks's writing is clear and engaging and his insider's perspective is informative and interesting, particularly when he explains how the military moved into the 21st century by emphasizing speed, agility, and better cooperation among the various branches--a significant shift from the first Persian Gulf war just a decade earlier. <p></p><p> In addition to his years as a war general, his memoir also covers his childhood, his early years in the Army, his tours of Vietnam, and how he contemplated retirement before being called up as commander of Central Command, "the most diverse, strategically vital&#x2014;and unstable&#x2014;region of the planet." Ever the diplomat, General Franks offers insights, but little criticism of individuals. Other than expressing admiration for his own staff and for President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in particular, he is tight-lipped about any conflict within the administration that may have occurred regarding policy issues. (The one exception is counterterrorism specialist Richard Clarke. "I never received a single operational recommendation, or a single page of actionable intelligence, from Richard Clarke," he writes). He also writes that he was surprised by the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that no WMDs were used against American troops. Still, the invasion of Iraq was justified in his eyes: "While we may not have found actual WMD stockpiles, what the Coalition discovered was the equivalent of a disassembled pistol, lying on a table beside neatly arranged trays of bullets." <i>American Soldier</i> is a compelling look at the war on terrorism from one who served on the frontlines as both a warrior and a diplomat. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><p>General Tommy Franks retired from the Army on August 1, 2003.

Alfalfa is often planted by farmers as a food crop for farm animals and to improve soil fertility (it fixes nitrogen from the air into the soil through its roots). A winter-hardy variety of alfalfa, developed by Wendeline Grimm in Carver County, Minnesota, in the late 1800s, was partially responsible for the establishment of the dairy industry in the upper Midwest in the early 1900s. Alfalfa&#x2019;s thin stems often cause the plant to fall over under its own weight at maturity, leaving it prostrate. Its flower color ranges from light blue to dark purple and it is a prime host plant for the alfalfa butterfly, Orange Sulphur.<br> </p><ul><li>Cluster type: Spike</li> <li>Flower type: Irregular</li> <li>Leaf type: Compound</li> <li>Leaf attachment: Alternate</li> <li>Fruit: Pod</li></ul></p><h2>Night Studio</h2><p>The author shares her memories of her father, describes his career as a painter, and depicts his attitudes towards art</p><p></p><h2>Think Big: Unleashing Your Potential for Excellence</h2><p><p>In this follow-up to his best-selling Gifted Hands, Dr. Ben Carson prescribes his personal formula for success.

Vollmann, author of the National Book Award winner <i>Europe Central</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>In this magnificent new work of fiction, his first in nine years, celebrated author William T. Vollmann offers a collection of ghost stories linked by themes of love, death, and the erotic.<br>&nbsp;<br>A Bohemian farmer&#x2019;s dead wife returns to him, and their love endures, but at a gruesome price. A geisha prolongs her life by turning into a cherry tree. A journalist, haunted by the half-forgotten killing of a Bosnian couple, watches their story, and his own wartime tragedy, slip away from him. A dying American romances the ghost of his high school sweetheart while a homeless salaryman in Tokyo animates paper cutouts of ancient heroes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Are ghosts memories, fantasies, or monsters? Is there life in death? Vollmann has always operated in the shadowy borderland between categories, and these eerie tales, however far-flung their settings, all focus on the attempts of the living to avoid, control, or even seduce death. Vollmann&#x2019;s stories will transport readers to a fantastical world where love and lust make anything possible.</p><p><b>William T. Vollmann</b> has written nine novels, three collections of stories, six works of nonfiction, and a memoir. He has won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a Whiting Writers Award, and the Strauss Living Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.<b>LISTENING TO THE SHELLS </b><p><b>1</b></p><p>In the dimming living room they were drinking slivovitz and water out of fine crystal glasses, and everyone was laughing and smoking American cigarettes until a shell fell twenty-five meters away. The women jumped. Another shell fell slightly closer and the women screamed. Then the people sat silently smoking in the last light, their smoke nearly the same color as the drinking glasses, and presently began to laugh again, leaning over their hands or spreading their fingers; they stubbed out their cigarettes in crystal ashtrays, and the poet who loved Vesna even suspected that finally he had found life. But Enko the militiaman sat glaring. Now it was dark, with echoes of the last light fading from the bubbles of mineral water just within the glasses and from the women&#x2019;s pale blouses, and they sat in silence, listening to the shells.</p><p>When a shell approaches closely, you may well hear a hiss before it strikes. Once it does, you will be deafened for a minute or two, during which time you are not good for much except to wait for another shell. Meanwhile you see what they call the big light. After that you can hear the screams of children.</p><p>Vesna&#x2019;s best friend Mirjana had had two little boys, and a shell killed them both. A shell had sheared away the tree in front of Vesna&#x2019;s apartment; the smash had been so loud that she was certain she must be wounded.</p><p>Mirjana said: Marinko has a car but no petrol. Do you know where he can get petrol?</p><p>Ask Enko, said Vesna.</p><p>Enko said nothing.</p><p>Smiling brightly, Mirjana tried to light another cigarette. The match-flame trembled between her fingers and went out. Vesna leaned toward her, so that they could touch their cigarettes together. People still had plenty of tobacco at that time. In a couple of years they would be smoking green tea.</p><p>Vesna said: It&#x2019;s quiet now, thanks to God!</p><p>In the corner sat Enko with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and his police ID clinking on its neck-chain. He had pulled off his bulletproof vest, which was leaning against the wall in easy reach. Every now and then his hand touched the grip of his gun in the holster; then he swigged from the crystal glass and took another drag; finally he pulled off his now ridiculous sunglasses, his head turning rapidly as he listened to his comrade Amir, who leaned forward as if anticipating something, all the while touching his moustache with a ringed forefinger. No one else could hear their conversation. Enko&#x2019;s cigarette burned steadily between two fingers as he raised it again, tapping his foot, and his face was young and hard.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Amir rose, gazed out the window into the greenish darkness, then went out.&#x2014; He knows how to get American whiskey, Enko explained.</p><p>Vesna said: Enko, can you tell me where Marinko can buy some petrol?</p><p>Who&#x2019;s Marinko?</p><p>Didn&#x2019;t you meet him? I thought you did. He&#x2019;s Mirjana&#x2019;s cousin.</p><p>Enko locked his bleak eyes on Mirjana. He said: Where are you from anyway?</p><p>Look, I&#x2019;m Sarajevan, just like you.</p><p>Great. Now what part of town are you from?</p><p>Her children are all killed, Vesna explained. From now she has none.</p><p>Who the fuck cares? said Enko. What do you need petrol for?</p><p>My cousin wants it. I don&#x2019;t ask him his business.</p><p>Enko laughed.&#x2014; Sure, he said. I can get him as much petrol as he wants.</p><p>He&#x2019;ll be grateful to you.</p><p>Gratitude doesn&#x2019;t do much for me, said Enko.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>When Amir came back with the whiskey, he informed Enko that there was a lost American journalist at the Holiday Inn.</p><p>At the Holiday Inn, journalists were smoking quietly around marble tables in the dark. Across the river a machine gun chortled like a night bird. Enko found the lost American and quickly uncovered his particulars: He had no idea what he wanted, and he could pay a hundred fifty Deutschemarks per day&#x2014;not nearly as much as any television reporter, let alone a sexy anchorwoman such as Christiane Amanpour, but whatever they could get out of him would be easy money, and his pockets might be deeper than he said. Amir, who had recently inherited an almost new Stojadin automobile, would be the driver, billing by the hour; while Enko would babysit the journalist at, for instance, a hundred fifty Deutschemarks a day. Amir and Enko knew that everything is negotiable, while the journalist knew that when one might be killed this very hour, all money is play money. So the three contracting parties quickly achieved agreement, Enko staring into the American&#x2019;s face while Amir drummed fingers on the tabletop as if he knew of more lucrative projects elsewhere, which indeed he did.</p><p>A man in a flak jacket and helmet strutted by, with his tape recorder&#x2019;s light glowing red. At another table, some functionary from Municipality Centar was assuring a French journalist: Everything will be solved by winter. Everything must be, or there will be hundreds and thousands dead.&#x2014; The Frenchman nodded delightedly. Now he could file his story.</p><p>The American journalist was encumbered by a pair of binoculars for which he would never have any purpose. Enko told him: I sure could use your binoculars.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll see, said the American vaguely. Maybe at the end . . .</p><p>Eight-o&#x2019;-clock, said Amir to the American. Goodbye.</p><p>See you then, the American said. Well, Enko, can I buy you another drink?</p><p>Sure. By the way, I&#x2019;m counting on those binoculars.</p><p>This building across the street, are there snipers in it? asked a very young British journalist in a worried voice.</p><p>Oh, no, they&#x2019;ve cleaned it! his handler assured him.</p><p>Enko knew the handler, who was a sonofabitch and had once stolen away from him a very pretty Swedish correspondent. He therefore leaned across his enemy and explained to the British journalist, as if out of helpfulness: But there&#x2019;s a sniper shooting at the other entrance. You don&#x2019;t use that.</p><p>Now the lost American was looking even more lost, just as Enko had intended. He needed to be reminded that Enko could ditch him at any time. As a matter of fact, Enko was a man of his word. He would never do less than he had contracted to do, and often he would do more. But it was bad business to reveal that at the beginning.</p><p>The light continued to fail. Looking out the front windows, which happened to be lacking a few ovals and triangles, the journalists stared at blue sky, and at that silent building across the street.</p><p>Another drink? said the American.</p><p>Enko began to feel sorry for him.&#x2014; There&#x2019;s a party if you want to come.</p><p>What time?</p><p>Now.</p><p>How will I get back?</p><p>No one expects you to go out by yourself, said Enko contemptuously. He rose, pulled his bulletproof vest down over his head and strapped it tight across his sides.</p><p><b>4</b></p><p>In the windows those shards of bluish twilight sky were already colder, and now the clouds swam in.</p><p>The lights had come on in the parking garage. All was noiseless. They emerged into the grey light, which was dulling down with dust and a little rain, Enko already half flooring the accelerator as they screeched around the protected corner and into the sniper&#x2019;s reach. Across the street, the journalist glimpsed a building with four rows of windows visible, grey and black like ice against the pale tan fa�ade. Metal was chattering, but not here. Almost biting his lip, his shoulders hunched as if that could somehow diminish his vulnerability, Enko wrenched the car around another corner; now they were rushing past yellow walls into the Stari Grad; there was dust, chalk and broken glass on the sidewalk.&#x2014; That&#x2019;s from right now, explained Enko, perhaps enjoying himself.&#x2014; Just then, more glass departed windows, smashing on the street. The journalist sat quietly in the passenger seat. He excelled at being calm when he was powerless.</p><p>Enko demanded: What do you think about those fucking Chetniks?</p><p>Murderers, said the journalist.</p><p>Temporarily satisfied, Enko said: A few days ago a man was killed in front of the President&#x2019;s palace. We tried to help him, but he was already bloody. The trail of blood went more than a thousand meters. Here&#x2019;s where she lives.</p><p>Who?</p><p>Vesna. When you get out you don&#x2019;t need to run, but I&#x2019;m telling you, pay attention and move your ass.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Wait a second. Inbound. Shut up. Shut up. No, we&#x2019;re fine.</p><p>As they trotted away from the car, they heard the shell explode.</p><p>In the dark landing between the first two flights of steps, Enko said: How about a cash advance?</p><p>Sure, said the journalist. How much?</p><p>Give me fifty.</p><p>Just a minute. Here it is.</p><p>Fine. Now, Vesna, she&#x2019;s open-minded. She won&#x2019;t care that I brought you. And there&#x2019;s chicks galore, hot chicks. Not that they&#x2019;d be especially interested in a guy like you, but maybe you&#x2019;ll get lucky.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Another thing. Anybody asks what you&#x2019;re paying me or if you&#x2019;re paying me, that&#x2019;s only my business.</p><p>I won&#x2019;t say a word.</p><p>I wish you&#x2019;d have brought those binoculars. I wanted to show them off.</p><p>Vesna&#x2019;s door was open. As they entered the apartment, which was foggy with cigarette smoke, they heard many people, and far away a machine gun fired three bursts. A woman laughed very loudly.</p><p>Look! cried Mirjana. I was wondering when you&#x2019;d get here. Who&#x2019;s that?</p><p>Just some American, said Enko.</p><p>And this is from my cousin, for the petrol. You&#x2019;d better count it.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t need to count it. If he shorted me, that&#x2019;s his problem.</p><p>Thanks for helping him.</p><p>Well, he owes me. Who&#x2019;s that girl over there?</p><p><b>5</b></p><p>At that party Enko met a woman named Jasmina, and in the morning he brought her home with her blouse buttoned up wrong and her lipstick smeared all over his neck. Enko&#x2019;s mother knew enough not to say anything. He was her only help. As for the American, he had to sleep in Vesna&#x2019;s living room because nobody felt like driving him back, especially after curfew. He didn&#x2019;t mind a bit. Until half-past three he sat up with the poet, discussing the novels of Ivo Andric, whom the poet detested, Danilo Ki , whose Garden, Ashes the poet liked better than he did, and, while Vesna sat smiling, smoking and yawning, the ideal form of Slavic feminine beauty, which, since they were young men, occupied their intellects. The other guests had departed. By now the snipers must likewise have gone to sleep, and the jewel-like silence which accordingly illuminated them both, not to mention their obsessive natures, rendered the conversation yet more interesting, if that were possible, than the topic warranted, so that they nearly could have been outside beneath the stars investigating essential things. Vesna had gone to share a cigarette with the new widow upstairs. The poet asserted that there was a certain kind of look, embodied in the bygone actress Olga Ilic, which had to do with dark eyes, dark hair (preferably curly), round silver earrings, large breasts, a long throat and plump lips. I am sorry to inform you that the American had never heard of Olga Ilic. The poet explained that she had played both Desdemona and Hamlet&#x2014;what a free spirit!&#x2014;and that on the wall of his room he treasured a newspaper photograph of her in the lead role of &#x201c;Bad Blood.&#x201d; If it weren&#x2019;t for the Chetniks, he&#x2019;d take the American by the arm and show him that picture right now, because these were the most important topics to human beings: true art, romance, expression&#x2014;all present in Olga Ilic&#x2019;s eyes.&#x2014; And you know, my friend, when she died, she was practically a beggar! One of our greatest Yugoslav actresses! If I could go back in time, I&#x2019;d attend one of her performances at the National Theater. She used to wear a rose on her breast, and then she&#x2019;d give it away. What a poem I could write about that!&#x2014; In the American, who cheerfully admitted to knowing less about Balkan womanhood than he should, or intended to, the poet found a refreshingly respectful audience; and in the poet the American found a guide to the names and charms of most of the women who had been there tonight, listening to the shells. It accordingly became evident that the poet was infatuated with Vesna, who now returned, smiling at them with seeming love even though there were dark rings under her eyes. The American allowed himself to be likewise infatuated, but without denying himself permission to remember Mirjana, Ivica and Dragica. Vesna poured them all a nightcap. To himself the American pretended that he had rescued her; now they would go to bed together for the first time. She gave him a blanket, and he lay down as far from the window as he could, with his bulletproof vest for a pillow. When the fabric got too wet, for instance from perspiration, it became dangerously permeable. That was why one shouldn&#x2019;t sleep in it. The poet sat up, writing a poem for Vesna. Like many egoists, he had a very kind heart, and so just before dawn, while it was still safe, he woke up the journalist and walked him over to Enko&#x2019;s.</p><p>At a quarter of nine that morning the noises began again, deep sullen thumpings and almost happy strings of popping like firecrackers. The poet had wisely departed long since. Enko and Jasmina were sleeping, or something. The journalist had brought a pound of American coffee for Vesna or some other ideal Slavic beauty, but, missing the opportunity to deploy it, he now gave it to Enko&#x2019;s mother instead. That tired, hungry old woman accepted the gift with neither surprise nor thanks. Whatever came to her came not from this foreigner, who was nothing, but from Enko.</p><p>Make yourself at home; take a shower, she said, slipping the coffee into her coat pocket.&#x2014; I have some business downstairs.</p><p>It was the first chilly day. The American took a cold shower in the pitch-dark bathroom and came out wondering how people would manage when the snow fell.</p><p>Now there were no shells, and the sun peered mirthlessly down on broken glass. Enko and Jasmina did not appear; nor yet did Enko&#x2019;s mother. Enko and Amir were on the payroll today, but the American, who did not know so very many things, did know that this would come right sooner or later, or not, and that in the meantime the best thing he could do was nothing. Tired, hungover, self-bemused by Vesna, who smiled on every guest; instructed by the poet in the ways of Slavic women, and of course altered by the various evil potentialities of the shells, he considered that he was making progress, and sat at the dining table cheerfully enough, writing up his observations, with his vest leaning against his knees. He thought it his duty to express something of these people&#x2019;s sufferings. If he were here for any reason, it must be that. If he could not do anything for them, then his journey had no purpose. As sincere in his way as Vesna, he wished for peace even if it made his story less dramatic. Like the poet, not to mention the snipers, he gave due credit to his feelings.</p><p>In front of the apartment the asphalt had been eaten away in blotches by shells, and beyond that was a littered sort of green over which wandered two dogs whose owners, Enko&#x2019;s mother had said, couldn&#x2019;t feed them anymore, and then a row of cars, some perfect, some rusted and windowless, some bullet-holed. The American listened. The smashing roar of a howitzer was startling, to be sure, but what did it accomplish? Did the besiegers p...</p></p><h2>Serendipity New Testament for Groups</h2><p>The only book you will need to lead a Bible study group is the Serendipity New Testament, which provides the text of the New Testament and 10,000 questions for personal or group reflection.

A native of Minneapolis, he currently lives in Texas.Brust's enjoyable 12th Vlad Taltos adventure (after 2008's <i>Jhegaala</i>) brings the former organized crime figure back to his hometown, where he must avoid the many assassins still on the lookout for him. As Vlad tries to help Aliera e'Kieron, an old friend recently fallen from high places, he uncovers an increasingly complex web of intrigue aimed at creating an illegal drug trade. To thwart the plot, Vlad must navigate among the Dragaeran Empress and her associates, his ex-wife, his former associate Krager, and other schemers. Named for the Dragaeran clan of lawyers and judges, this installment has less action and more inscrutable dialogue than previous novels, providing some new insight into the interactions of the 17 clans.

His eyes were bulging from behind his steel-rimmed glasses, he had plastered one hand over his face so that his palm was partially cupping his mouth, and his neck could have been on ball-bearings the way he was craning back over his shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop the car, Dennis! Go back!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go back, I want to look at her again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly I understood. &#x201c;Oh, man, forget it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you mean that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thing we just passed&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go back!&#x201d; He was almost screaming.<br> <br>I went back, thinking that it was maybe one of Arnie&#x2019;s subtle little jokes. But it wasn&#x2019;t. He was gone, lock, stock, and barrel. Arnie had fallen in love.<br> <br>She was a bad joke, and what Arnie saw in her that day I&#x2019;ll never know. The left side of her windshield was a snarled spiderweb of cracks. The right rear deck was bashed in, and an ugly nest of rust had grown in the paint-scraped valley. The back bumper was askew, the trunk-lid was ajar, and upholstery was bleeding out through several long tears in the seat covers, both front and back. It looked as if someone had worked on the upholstery with a knife. One tire was flat. The others were bald enough to show the canvas cording. Worst of all, there was a dark puddle of oil under the engine block.<br> <br>Arnie had fallen in love with a 1958 Plymouth Fury, one of the long ones with the big fins. There was an old and sun-faded FOR SALE sign propped on the right side of the windshield&#x2014;the side that was not cracked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look at her lines, Dennis!&#x201d; Arnie whispered. He was running around the car like a man possessed. His sweaty hair flew and flopped. He tried the back door on the passenger side, and it came open with a scream.<br> <br>&#x201c;Arnie, you&#x2019;re having me on, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s sunstroke, right? Tell me it&#x2019;s sunstroke. I&#x2019;ll take you home and put you under the frigging air conditioner and we&#x2019;ll forget all about this, okay?&#x201d; But I said it without much hope. He knew how to joke, but there was no joke on his face then. Instead, there was a kind of goofy madness I didn&#x2019;t like much.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t even bother to reply. A hot, stuffy billow of air, redolent of age, oil, and advanced decomposition, puffed out of the open door. Arnie didn&#x2019;t seem to notice that, either. He got in and sat down on the ripped and faded back seat. Once, twenty years before, it had been red. Now it was a faded wash pink.<br> <br>I reached in and pulled up a little puff of upholstery, looked at it, and blew it away. &#x201c;Looks like the Russian army marched over it on their way to Berlin,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He finally noticed I was still there. &#x201c;Yeah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yeah. But she could be fixed up. She could&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she could be tough. A moving unit, Dennis. A beauty. A real&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here! Here! What you two kids up to?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was an old guy who looked as if he was enjoying&#x2014;more or less&#x2014;his seventieth summer. Probably less. This particular dude struck me as the sort of man who enjoyed very little. His hair was long and scraggy, what little there was left of it. He had a good case of psoriasis going on the bald part of his skull.<br> <br>He was wearing green old man&#x2019;s pants and lowtopped Keds. No shirt; instead there was something cinched around his waist that looked like a lady&#x2019;s corset. When he got closer I saw it was a back brace. From the look of it I would say, just offhand, that he had changed it last somewhere around the time Lyndon Johnson died.<br> <br>&#x201c;What you kids up to?&#x201d; His voice was shrill and strident.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, is this your car?&#x201d; Arnie asked him. Not much question that it was. The Plymouth was parked on the lawn of the postwar tract house from which the old man had issued. The lawn was horrible, but it looked positively great with that Plymouth in the foreground for perspective.<br> <br>&#x201c;What if it is?&#x201d; The old guy demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x201d;&#x2014;Arnie had to swallow&#x2014;&#x201c;I want to buy it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old dude&#x2019;s eyes gleamed. The angry look on his face was replaced by a furtive gleam in the eye and a certain hungry sneer around the lips. Then a large resplendent shit-eating grin appeared. That was the moment, I think&#x2014;then, just at that moment&#x2014;when I felt something cold and blue inside me. There was a moment&#x2014;just then&#x2014;when I felt like slugging Arnie and dragging him away. Something came into the old man&#x2019;s eyes. Not just the gleam; it was something behind the gleam.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you should have said so,&#x201d; the old guy told Arnie. He stuck out his hand and Arnie took it. &#x201c;LeBay&#x2019;s the name. Roland D. LeBay. U.S. Army, retired.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Arnie Cunningham.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old sport pumped his hand and sort of waved at me. I was out of the play; he had his sucker. Arnie might as well have handed LeBay his wallet.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much?&#x201d; Arnie asked. And then he plunged ahead. &#x201c;Whatever you want for her, it&#x2019;s not enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>I groaned inside instead of sighing. His checkbook had just joined his wallet.<br> <br>For a moment LeBay&#x2019;s grin faltered a little, and his eyes narrowed down suspiciously. I think he was evaluating the possibility that he was being put on. He studied Arnie&#x2019;s open, longing face for signs of guile, and then asked the murderously perfect question:<br> <br>&#x201c;Son, have you ever owned a car before?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He owns a Mustang Mach II,&#x201d; I said quickly. &#x201c;His folks bought it for him. It&#x2019;s got a Hurst shifter, a supercharger, and it can boil the road in first gear. It&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Arnie said quietly. &#x201c;I just got my driver&#x2019;s license this spring.&#x201d;<br> <br>LeBay tipped me a brief but crafty gaze and then swung his full attention back to his prime target. He put both hands in the small of his back and stretched. I caught a sour whiff of sweat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got a back problem in the Army,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Full disability. Doctors could never put it right. Anyone ever asks you what&#x2019;s wrong with the world, boys, you tell em it&#x2019;s three things: Doctors, commies, and nigger radicals. Of the three, commies is the worst, closely followed by doctors. And if they want to know who told you, tell em Roland D. LeBay. Yessir.&#x201d;<br> <br>He touched the old, scuffed hood of the Plymouth with a kind of bemused love.<br> <br>&#x201c;This here is the best car I ever owned. Bought her in September 1957. Back then, that&#x2019;s when you got your new model year, in September. All summer long they&#x2019;d show you pictures of cars under hoods and cars under tarps until you were fair dyin t&#x2019;know what they looked like underneath. Not like now.&#x201d; His voice dripped contempt for the debased times he had lived to see. &#x201c;Brand-new, she was. Had the smell of a brand-new car, and that&#x2019;s about the finest smell in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>He considered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Except maybe for pussy.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at Arnie, nibbling the insides of my cheeks madly to keep from braying laughter all over everything. Arnie looked back at me, astounded. The old man appeared to notice neither of us; he was off on his own planet.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was in khaki for thirty-four years,&#x201d; LeBay told us, still touching the hood of the car. &#x201c;Went in at sixteen in 1923. I et dust in Texas and seen crabs as big as lobsters in some o them Nogales whoredens. I saw men with their guts comin out their ears during Big Two. In France I saw that. Their guts was comin out their ears. You believe that, son?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yessir,&#x201d; Arnie said. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d heard a word LeBay said. He was shifting from foot to foot as if he had to go to the bathroom bad. &#x201c;About the car, though&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You go to the University?&#x201d; LeBay barked suddenly. &#x201c;Up there at Horlicks?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nosir, I go to Libertyville High.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; LeBay said grimly. &#x201c;Steer clear of colleges. They&#x2019;re full of niggerlovers that want to give away the Panama Canal. &#x2018;Think-tanks,&#x2019; they call em. &#x2018;Asshole-tanks,&#x2019; say I.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gazed fondly at the car sitting on its flat tire, its paintjob mellowing rustily in the late afternoon sunlight.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hurt my back in the spring of &#x2019;57,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Army was going to rack and ruin even then. I got out just in time. I came on back to Libertyville. Looked over the rolling iron. I took my time. Then I walked into Norman Cobb&#x2019;s Plymouth dealership&#x2014;where the bowling alley is now on outer Main Street&#x2014;and I ordered this here car. I said you get it in red and white, next year&#x2019;s model. Red as a fire-engine on the inside. And they did it. When I got her, she had a total of six miles on the odometer. Yessir.&#x201d;<br> <br>He spat.<br> <br>I glanced over Arnie&#x2019;s shoulder at the odometer. The glass was cloudy, but I could read the damage all the same: 97,432. And six-tenths. Jesus wept.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you love the car so much, why are you selling it?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>He turned a milky, rather frightening gaze on me. &#x201c;Are you cracking wise on me, son?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t answer, but I didn&#x2019;t drop my gaze either.<br> <br>After a few moments of eye-to-eye duelling (which Arnie totally ignored; he was running a slow and loving hand over one of the back fins), he said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t drive anymore. Back&#x2019;s gotten too bad. Eyes are going the same way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly I got it&#x2014;or thought I did. If he had given us the correct dates, he was seventy-one. And at seventy, this state makes you start taking compulsory eye exams every year before they&#x2019;ll renew your driver&#x2019;s license. LeBay had either failed his eye exam or was afraid of failing. Either way, it came to the same thing. Rather than submit to that indignity, he had put the Plymouth up. And after that, the car had gotten old fast.<br> <br>&#x201c;How much do you want for it?&#x201d; Arnie asked again. Oh, he just couldn&#x2019;t wait to be slaughtered.<br> <br>LeBay turned his face up to the sky, appearing to consider it for rain. Then he looked down at Arnie again and gave him a large, kindly smile that was far too much like the previous shit-eating grin for me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asking three hundred,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you seem a likely enough lad. I&#x2019;ll make it two-fifty for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh my Christ,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>But he knew who his sucker was, and he knew exactly how to drive the wedge in between us. In the words of my grandfather, he hadn&#x2019;t fallen off a haytruck yesterday.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said brusquely. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s how you want it. I got my four-thirty story to watch. Edge of Night. Never miss it if I can help it. Nice chinning with you boys. So long.&#x201d;<br> <br>Arnie threw me such a smoking look of pain and anger that I backed off a step. He went after the old man and took his elbow. They talked. I couldn&#x2019;t hear it all, but I could see more than enough. The old man&#x2019;s pride was wounded. Arnie was earnest and apologetic. The old man just hoped Arnie understood that he couldn&#x2019;t stand to see the car that had brought him through safe to his golden years insulted. Arnie agreed. Little by little, the old man allowed himself to be led back. And again I felt something consciously dreadful about him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was as if a cold November wind could think. I can&#x2019;t put it any better than that.<br> <br>&#x201c;If he says one more word, I wash my hands of the whole thing,&#x201d; LeBay said, and cocked a horny, callused thumb at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t, he won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Arnie said hastily. &#x201c;Three hundred, did you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I believe that was&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two-fifty was the quoted price,&#x201d; I said loudly.<br> <br>Arnie looked stricken, afraid the old man would walk away again, but LeBay was taking no chances. The fish was almost out of the pond now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two-fifty would do it, I guess,&#x201d; LeBay allowed. He glanced my way again, and I saw that we had an understanding&#x2014;he didn&#x2019;t like me and I didn&#x2019;t like him.<br> <br>To my ever-increasing horror, Arnie pulled his wallet out and began thumbing through it. There was silence among the three of us. LeBay looked on. I looked away at a little kid who was trying to kill himself on a puke-green skateboard. Somewhere a dog barked. Two girls who looked like eighth-or ninth-graders went past, giggling and holding clutches of library books to their blooming chests. I had only one hope left for getting Arnie out of this; it was the day before payday. Given time, even twenty-four hours, this wild fever might pass. Arnie was beginning to remind me of Toad, of Toad Hall.<br> <br>When I looked back, Arnie and LeBay were looking at two fives and six ones&#x2014;all that had been in his wallet, apparently.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about a check?&#x201d; Arnie asked.<br> <br>LeBay offered Arnie a dry smile and said nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good check,&#x201d; Arnie protested. It would be, too. We had been working all summer for Carson Brothers on the I-376 extension, the one which natives of the Pittsburgh area firmly believe will never be really finished. Arnie sometimes declared that Penn-DOT had begun taking bids on the I-376 work shortly after the Civil War ended. Not that either of us had any right to complain; a lot of kids were either working for slave wages that summer or not working at all. We were making good money, even clocking some overtime. Brad Jeffries, the job foreman, had been frankly dubious about taking a kid like Arnie on, but had finally allowed that he could use a flagman; the girl he had been planning to hire had gotten herself pregnant and had run off to get married. So Arnie had started off flagging in June but had gotten into the harder work little by little, running mostly on guts and determination. It was the first real job he&#x2019;d ever had, and he didn&#x2019;t want to screw it up. Brad was reasonably impressed, and the summer sun had even helped Arnie&#x2019;s erupting complexion a little. Maybe it was the ultraviolet.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s a good check, son,&#x201d; LeBay said, &#x201c;but I gotta make a cash deal. You understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know if Arnie understood, but I did. It would be too easy to stop payment on a local check if this rustbucket Plymouth threw a rod or blew a piston on the way home.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can call the bank,&#x201d; Arnie said, starting to sound desperate.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; LeBay said, scratching his armpit above the scabrous brace. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going on five-thirty. Bank&#x2019;s long since closed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A deposit, then,&#x201d; Arnie said, and held out the sixteen dollars. He looked positively wild. It may be that you&#x2019;re having trouble believing a kid who was almost old enough to vote could have gotten himself so worked up over an anonymous old clunk in the space of fifteen minutes. I was having some trouble believing it myself. Only Roland D. LeBay seemed not to be having trouble with it, and I supposed it was because at his age he had seen everything. It was only later that I came to believe that his odd sureness might come from other sources. Either way, if any milk of human kindness had ever run in his veins, it had curdled to sour cream long ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d have to have at least ten percent down,&#x201d; LeBay said. The fish was out of the water; in a moment it would be netted. &#x201c;If I had ten percent, I&#x2019;d hold her for twenty-four hours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dennis,&#x201d; Arnie said. &#x201c;Can you loan me nine bucks until tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had twelve in my own wallet, and no particular place to go. Day after day of spreading sand and digging trenches for culverts had done wonders when it came to getting ready for football practice, but I had no social life at all. Lately I hadn&#x2019;t even been assaulting the ramparts of my cheerleader girlfriend&#x2019;s body in the style to which she had become accustomed. I was rich but lonely.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on over here and let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>LeBay&#x2019;s brow darkened, but he could see he was stuck with my input, like it or not. His frizzy white hair blew back and forth in the mild breeze. He kept one hand possessively on the Plymouth&#x2019;s hood.<br> <br>Arnie and I walked back toward where my car, a &#x2019;75 Duster, was parked at the curb. I put an arm around Arnie&#x2019;s shoulders. For some reason I remembered the two of us up in his room on a rainy fall day...</p><h2>Great Camps of the Adirondacks</h2><p>Adolph Lewisohn, requiring a staff of forty to minister to his guests' comfort in the wilds of the Adirondacks, imported to his camp a major-domo, barber, caddy, chess-player, singing teacher, and two chauffeurs, Majorie Merriweather Post made do with eighty-five servants for the sixty-five building of Topridge, which was approached by a private funicular railway and graced by a Russian dacha a token of affection for her third husband, a former ambassador to the Soviet Union.<br><br>Equally magnificent was J.P. Morgan's Camp Uncas, Julius Bache's Wenonah Lodge, and William Seward Webb's Nehasane. These 'Great Camps' were to the beautiful and secluded Adirondack region what the 'Cottages' were to Newport: contradictions in terminology, but marvels of construction and architectural imagination. Truly fabulous structures, built primarily of wood and stone and set deep among the great forests, they are at once relics of a bygone age and prototypes for the contemporary architect, amateur builder, and historian.<br><br>Harvey Kaiser traces the history of the Adirondacks from their first sighting by a European in 1535, through the eras of trapping, iron mining, and lumbering, to the development of railroad and steamboat lines that led to the influx of tourists and the building of the 'Great Camps.' The sixty years from 1870 to 1930 were the heyday of these camps, the 'Gilded Age' of the Adirondacks, and Kaiser give a fascinating account both of the personalities who engineered and financed these fabulous structures and of the buildings themselves...<br><br>More than forty years after the Depression put an end to this princely life-style, the camps themselves are threatened by the forces of politics and nature. In Great Camps of the Adirondacks, Harvey Kaiser make a strong case for preservation: the obliteration of these remarkable structures would be an irreparable loss not only to our architectural heritage but to every individual to whom they are a resource and an inspiration.</p><p>Harvey Kaiser is an administrator and professor at Syracuse University in New York.</p><h2>Rabid: A Cultural History of the World&#39;s Most Diabolical Virus</h2><p>A maddened creature, frothing at the mouth, lunges at an innocent victim&#x2014;and, with a bite, transforms its prey into another raving monster. It&#x2019;s a scenario that underlies our darkest tales of supernatural horror, but its power derives from a very real virus, a deadly scourge known to mankind from our earliest days. In this fascinating exploration, journalist Bill Wasik and veterinarian Monica Murphy chart four thousand years in the history, science, and cultural mythology of rabies.<br><br>The most fatal virus known to science, rabies kills nearly 100 percent of its victims once the infection takes root in the brain. A disease that spreads avidly from animals to humans, rabies has served throughout history as a symbol of savage madness, of inhuman possession. And today, its history can help shed light on the wave of emerging diseases, from AIDS to SARS to avian flu, that we now know to originate in animal populations.&nbsp;<br><br>From Greek myths to zombie flicks, from the laboratory heroics of Louis Pasteur to the contemporary search for a lifesaving treatment, <i>Rabid </i>is a fresh, fascinating, and often wildly entertaining look at one of mankind&#x2019;s oldest and most fearsome foes.&nbsp;</p><p>Bill Wasik is a senior editor at <i>Wired</i> and was formerly a senior editor at <i>Harper&#x2019;s;</i> he writes on technology, media, and crowd dynamics.

As civilization has advanced over the march of millennia, humans have assiduously stripped the animal kingdom of its armies, decommissioned its officers. Some erstwhile adversaries we have hunted to extinction, or nearly so. Others we confine to zoos, to child-friendly safari parks. The balance we shunt to the margins as we clear their land for ourselves&#x2014;erecting our own sprawling habitats on the ruins of theirs, naming our cul-de-sacs for whatever wilderness we dozed to pave them.<br><br>Peer through news reports, though, and one can find pockets of resistance, as if some ancient animal essence were periodically reawakening. Consider the bobcat in Cottonwood, Arizona, that set out on a rampage one recent March evening, menacing a worker outside a Pizza Hut and then sauntering into a bar, sending patrons onto the pool table, mauling the one who dared to snap a picture on his phone. Or the furious otter in Vero Beach, Florida, at a waterfront golf community called Grand Harbor (a &#x201c;gated enclave,&#x201d; brags its website, &#x201c;for those seeking the ultimate resort-at-home lifestyle&#x201d;), that gnawed three residents, one of them while out on the links. Or the enraged beaver at the Loch Raven Reservoir, in the genteel exurban sprawl north of Baltimore, that cruelly interrupted the summertime reverie of four swimmers, a nightmare that ended only when the husband of one pulled the beaver from his wife&#x2019;s upper thigh and smashed it with a rock.<br><br>Typically these creatures will shun the society of humans. But in an instant we can find them transformed into bewilderingly avid attackers, accosting us as we retrieve our mail or walk our dogs, sometimes even carrying out a home invasion. A particularly harrowing tale comes to us from the Adirondack hamlet of Lake George, N.Y. On an April evening just a few years ago, a young couple was walking from their car when they were set upon by a gray fox. The two managed to rush inside their home and close the door. But nearly a half hour later, when they opened the door again, the fox lay in wait; it sprinted toward the opening; only quick reflexes allowed the young man to close it just as the creature&#x2019;s snout broached the threshold. When an animal control officer arrived, the fox attacked his SUV, repeatedly sinking its teeth into his tires. He shot at it multiple times from out his driver&#x2019;s side window, but failed to hit his mark. Later, after the officer had finally run the fox over, he told a reporter that it was the single most aggressive foe he had encountered in nine years on the job. &#x201c;This was a four- or five-pound animal attacking a 3,000-pound vehicle,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The sheer tenacity: that is the truly chilling element in all these tales. &#x201c;What disturbs me,&#x201d; remarked one Connecticut man to the local news, regarding the raccoon he had lately beaten to death with a hammer, &#x201c;is I smashed his mouth off, I smashed his teeth in, but he still wanted to continue in the attack mode. I was actually terrified at the resilience of this animal.&#x201d; In Pittsfield, Mass., on a sleepy street backing up to the Housatonic River, a fox attacked twice in an eight-hour span. In the first incident, one neighbor struck the fox multiple times with the lid to his barbecue smoker. Yet still the fox returned earlier the next morning, biting the girl next door; it took twenty minutes for the man and her sister to pry the fox off her leg, before the man could knock the fox unconscious and then choke it to extinction.<br><br>One victim in Putnam County, New York, survived her own interminable ordeal with a raccoon, which assaulted her at the end of her half-mile-long driveway. She held down the snarling beast while she tried to free her cellphone to call the house; eventually, her husband and son had to club the raccoon repeatedly with a tire iron before it died. (&#x201c;I felt that nature had betrayed me,&#x201d; she later told a reporter for the public-radio show<i> This American Life</i>.)Then there was the red fox in South Carolina that pursued a nine-year-old as he made his way to the school bus one morning. After an adult neighbor sheltered the boy in his house, the fox latched onto the good Samaritan&#x2019;s foot. He flung the animal into his home office, where it flailed against the walls and windows before finally falling asleep on a dog bed.<br><br>Nearly any species can be afflicted. Arizona officials were recently called to the scene after a dog was attacked by a mad peccary, a pig-like creature whose residence in the southwest had until that point been considered largely peaceable. In Robbins, N.C., it was a skunk that beset the pet Pekinese of David Sanders, who was forced to watch the two creatures battle it out for the better part of an hour. (Sanders was unable to shoot the challenger, he explained, because all he had at hand was a shotgun.) In Decatur County, Ga., a donkey fell prey to the madness and bit its owner on the hand. In Imperial, Nebraska, the afflicted animal was literally a lamb, part of a child&#x2019;s 4-H project gone terribly, almost Biblically awry. Some primeval force must truly be at work when the lamb can be made into a lion.<br><br>***<br><br>The agent of all these diabolical acts of possession is, of course, a virus. It is the most fatal virus in the world, a pathogen that kills 100 percent of its hosts in most species, including humans. Fittingly, the rabies virus is shaped like a bullet: a cylindrical shell of glycoproteins and lipids that carries, in its rounded tip, a malevolent payload of helical RNA. On entering a living thing, it eschews the bloodstream, the default route of most viruses but a path fraught with danger from immuno-protective sentries. Instead, like almost no other virus known to science, rabies sets its course through the nervous system, creeping upstream at one to two centimeters per day (on average) through the axoplasm, the transmission lines that conduct electrical impulses to and from the brain. Once inside the brain, the virus works slowly, diligently, fatally to warp the mind, suppressing the rational and stimulating the animal. Aggression rises to fever pitch; inhibitions melt away; salivation is ratcheted up. The infected creature now has only days to live, and these he will likely spend on the attack, foaming at the mouth, chasing and lunging and biting in the throes of madness&#x2014;because the demon that possesses him seeks more hosts.<br><br>If this sounds like a horror movie, we should not be surprised, for it is a scenario bound up into our very concept of horror. Rabies is a scourge as old as human civilization, and the terror of its manifestation is a fundamental human fear, because it challenges the boundary of humanity itself. That is, it troubles the line where man ends and animal begins&#x2014;for the rabid bite is <i>the</i> visible symbol of the animal infecting the human, of an illness in a creature metamorphosing demonstrably into that same illness in a person.<br><br>Today, we understand that more than half our new diseases (60 percent, by a recent tally in <i>Nature</i>) are &#x201c;zoonotic,&#x201d; i.e. originating in animal populations, and our widespread fear of the worst of these (swine flu, AIDS, West Nile, Ebola) has been colored by our knowledge of their bestial origins. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that nothing has made humans sicker than our association with animals. Not only our emerging diseases today but the major killers throughout the ages&#x2014;smallpox, tuberculosis, malaria, influenza&#x2014;evolved from similar diseases in animals. This is what Jared Diamond has called &#x201c;the lethal gift of livestock,&#x201d; a major shaper of human destiny; the very fact that the agricultural lifestyle won out over that of the hunter-gatherer is due in part, Diamond argues, because the former &#x201c;breathed out nastier germs.&#x201d; Through their close contact with livestock, early farmers built up immunity to illnesses that would readily kill unexposed populations, a dynamic that still holds for emerging infectious diseases today.<br><br>Yet until the early twentieth century, humans had no idea that so many of its illnesses derived from animals. During those years when the most catastrophic zoonosis in history struck&#x2014;the fourteenth-century Black Death, or bubonic plague, which spreads to humans via fleas living on the backs of rats and other rodents&#x2014;scholars blamed nearly everything else, from demonic forces and bad air to astronomical happenings and even human malefactors. For centuries, rabies was the only illness in which the animalistic transfer, or more like a transformation, was clear. No microscope was required to see the possession take place. A mad animal bit; a mad man appeared; each would die a terrible death. The madness could lurk within any beast, even in&#x2014;especially in&#x2014;the most domesticated and loyal of all, the dog.<br><br>As the unique mode of animal to human infection, rabies has always shaded into something more supernatural: into animal metamorphoses, into monstrous hybridities. When Greek myth beholds Lycaon, king of Arcadia, as he transforms into a slavering wolf, his countenance is &#x201c;rabid,&#x201d; his jaws &#x201c;bespluttered with foam.&#x201d; In fifteenth-century Spain, witch-hunters called <i>saludadores</i> were reputed, also, as healers of rabies, a convergence that makes eminent sense given the widely-held association between witches and demonic canine familiars. Between the fifteenth and eighteenth century, Europe gestated two enduring legends whose part-human, part-animal malefactors bite their victims, thereby passing along their own degraded conditions&#x2014;namely, the werewolf and the vampire, both of whom haunt the Western imagination to the present day. As Susan Sontag pointed out, even as late as the nineteenth century, when viruses were becoming well understood and a rabies vaccine lay just around the corner, the true source of the rabies panics in France was not the fatality of the disease but rather the &#x201c;fantasy&#x201d;&#x2014;though one might accurately say the fact&#x2014;&#x201c;that infection transformed people into maddened animals.&#x201d;<br><br>Paradoxically, during the twentieth century, after Pasteur&#x2019;s invention of a rabies vaccine provided a near-foolproof means of preventing its fatality in humans, our dark fascination with rabies seemed only to swell. The vaccine itself became as mythologized as the bug, such that even today, many Americans believe that treatment requires some twenty (or is it thirty?) shots, delivered with a footlong syringe into the stomach. (It&#x2019;s four shots, for the record, and not particularly deep in the arm.) Even as vaccination of dogs in the United States was reducing the infection rate in that species down to negligible levels, a generation of children learned to scrutinize their pet pooches for the slightest signs of madness, largely thanks to the malign influence of <i>Old Yeller</i>, a Walt Disney film about a frontier-era boy who falls in love with a yellow dog that becomes rabid. Twenty-five years later, a novel called <i>Cujo</i> (and its subsequent film adaptation) taught a whole new generation to fear rabies, albeit a bit more forthrightly: no one finished the book or left the theater surprised by what became of that nice dog.<br><br>It&#x2019;s almost as if the very anachronism of rabies, to the Western mind, has rendered it even more intriguing to us. Like the vampire, rabies carries with it the musty whiff of a centuries-old terror, even as it still terrifies us in the present day. Lately, TV comedians have taken to seizing on it for a laugh: two animated series created by Mike Judge, <i>King of the Hill</i> and <i>Beavis and Butt-head,</i> have both done episodes on rabies, as did the long-running medical comedy <i>Scrubs</i>. In the U.S. version of <i>The Office,</i> Michael Scott (the bumbling boss played by Steve Carell), tries to paper over the fact that he has hit an employee with her car by organizing a charity &#x201c;race for the cure.&#x201d; The disease he chooses is rabies. The boss soon becomes perplexed at how few donations are forthcoming:<br><br>Michael Scott: I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. How&#x2019;s that going?<br><br>Pam Beesly: Not well. A doctor won&#x2019;t come out to collect a check for 700 dollars. Or 500 dollars, if we go with the giant check. And also, there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.<br><br>***<br><br>Contrary to what your television may have told you, there are most assuredly still rabies doctors, and humans still die in the tens of thousands from the disease (55,000, in the latest estimate)&#x2014;just not usually in the United States, or in Western Europe. The dead hail overwhelmingly from Asia and Africa, from countries where vaccination is too expensive or too difficult to procure. And the course of their suffering is every bit as grim, and as inevitably fatal, as the course endured by victims throughout the millennia.<br><br>Indeed, other than the wide availability of painkillers, which can help stifle the final agonies of the disease, the sequence of horrors faced by a rabies patient today is hardly different from those experienced by the man who was probably the most eminent rabies victim in history: Charles Lennox, Fourth Duke of Richmond, who for the two years leading up to his death in 1819 served as Governor-General of Canada, the top post in what was then still a colonial government. The Duke was a famous lover of dogs; a portrait of Lennox as a boy shows the young nobleman reclining against a tree stump as an adoring spaniel paws at his finery. Ironically, it was not a dog but rather a fox, the ostensibly tame pet of a solider whose garrison the Duke had occasion to inspect in Quebec, whose jaws were to blame for his demise. When the fox tangled with his own dog&#x2014;Blucher, so named in honor of Gebhard Leberecht von Bl�cher, the Prussian general who had recently bested Napoleon at Waterloo&#x2014;Lennox stepped in to separate them. The mad fox seized this chance to insult the visiting head of state, chomping down hard on the base of his thumb.<br><br>After a bite, the rabies virus binds quickly into the peripheral nerves but then makes its course with almost impossible sloth, requiring usually at least three weeks and often as long as three months to arrive at and penetrate the brain; on rare occasions a full year, or even five years, can elapse before the onset of symptoms. During this time the wound will heal over, and the victim may even forget about his scrape with a snarling beast. But healed or no, as the virus enters the brain the wound will usually seem to return, as if by magic, with some odd sensation occurring at the site. This sensation can take many forms: stabbing pain, or numbness; burning, or unnatural cold; tingling, or itching, or even a tremor. At roughly the same time, these soon-to-be-doomed patients typically display general signs of influenza, with a fever and perhaps a sore throat or some mild nausea. In the case of the Duke of Richmond, it began one day with shoulder pains and a sore throat, then progressed the following day to insomnia and fatigue.<br><br>All this is merely prelude to the illness itself, whose most notable symptom in humans&#x2014;unique, as far as physicians know, to rabies among all diseases &#x2014;is a terrifying condition called <i>hydrophobia</i>. As the term suggests, hydrophobia is a fear of water, though the word &#x201c;fear&#x201d; does not do justice to the eerie and fully physical manner in which it manifests. Present the hydrophobic patient with a cup of water and, though he desperately wants to drink it, his entire body rebels against the consummation of this act. The outstretched arm jerks away just as it is about to bring the cup to the parched lips. Other times the entire body convulses at the thought. Just beholding the water can make the diaphragm involuntarily contract, causing patients to gag and retch.

It was on the northern tip of the Scottish island of Jura, at the end of a dirt track, inaccessible by automobile, with no telephone or electricity. The nearest shop, the only one on the island, was some twenty-five miles to the south. Blair had reasons to want remoteness. Dejected by the recent death of his wife, he was suffering from tuberculosis and would soon begin coughing up blood. His country was reeling from the costs of a military victory that had brought neither security, nor prosperity, nor even the assurance that freedom would survive. Europe was dividing into two hostile camps, and the world seemed set to follow. With atomic bombs likely to be used, any new war would be apocalyptic. And he needed to finish a novel.</p><p>Its title was <i>1984</i>, an inversion of the year in which he completed it, and it appeared in Great Britain and the United States in 1949 under Blair&#x2019;s pen name, George Orwell. The reviews, the <i>New York Times</i> noted, were &#x201c;overwhelmingly admiring,&#x201d; but &#x201c;with cries of terror rising above the applause.&#x201d;1 This was hardly surprising because <i>1984</i> evoked an age, only three and a half decades distant, in which totalitarianism has triumphed everywhere. Individuality is smothered, along with law, ethics, creativity, linguistic clarity, honesty about history, and even love&#x2014;apart, of course, from the love everyone is forced to feel for the Stalin-like dictator &#x201c;Big Brother&#x201d; and his counterparts, who run a world permanently at war. &#x201c;If you want a picture of the future,&#x201d; Orwell&#x2019;s hero Winston Smith is told, as he undergoes yet another session of relentless torture, &#x201c;imagine a boot stamping on a human face&#x2014;forever.&#x201d;2</p><p>Orwell did die early in 1950&#x2014;in a London hospital, not on his island&#x2014;knowing only that his book had impressed and frightened its first readers. Subsequent readers responded similarly: <i>1984</i> became the single most compelling vision in the post&#x2013;World War II era of what might follow it. As the real year 1984 approached, therefore, comparisons with Orwell&#x2019;s imaginary year became inescapable. The world was not yet totalitarian, but dictators dominated large parts of it. The danger of war between the United States and the Soviet Union&#x2014;two superpowers instead of the three Orwell had anticipated&#x2014;seemed greater than it had for many years. And the apparently permanent conflict known as the &#x201c;Cold War,&#x201d; which began while Orwell was still alive, showed not the slightest signs of ending.</p><p>But then, on the evening of January 16, 1984, an actor Orwell would have recognized from his years as a film reviewer appeared on television in his more recent role as president of the United States. Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s reputation until this moment had been that of an ardent Cold Warrior. Now, though, he envisaged a different future:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just suppose with me for a moment that an Ivan and an Anya could find themselves, say, in a waiting room, or sharing a shelter from the rain or a storm with a Jim and Sally, and that there was no language barrier to keep them from getting acquainted. Would they then deliberate the differences between their respective governments? Or would they find themselves comparing notes about their children and what each other did for a living? . . . They might even have decided that they were all going to get together for dinner some evening soon. Above all, they would have proven that people don&#x2019;t make wars.3</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was an unexpectedly gentle invitation for human faces to prevail over boots, dictators, and the mechanisms of war. It set in motion, in Orwell&#x2019;s year 1984, the sequence of events by which they would do so. Just over a year after Reagan&#x2019;s speech, an ardent enemy of totalitarianism took power in the Soviet Union. Within six years, that country&#x2019;s control over half of Europe had collapsed. Within eight, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&#x2014;the country that had provoked Orwell&#x2019;s great gloomy prophecy in the first place&#x2014;had itself ceased to exist.</p><p>These things did not happen simply because Reagan gave a speech or because Orwell wrote a book: the remainder of this book complicates the causation. It is worth starting with visions, though, because they establish hopes and fears. History then determines which prevail.</p><p><b> CHAPTER ONE</b></p><p><b> THE RETURN OF FEAR</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>We waited for them to come ashore. We could see their faces.

The date was April 25, 1945, the place the eastern German city of Torgau on the Elbe, the event the first meeting of the armies, converging from opposite ends of the earth, that had cut Nazi Germany in two. Five days later Adolf Hitler blew his brains out beneath the rubble that was all that was left of Berlin. Just over a week after that, the Germans surrendered unconditionally. The leaders of the victorious Grand Alliance, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Josef Stalin, had already exchanged their own handshakes, toasts, and hopes for a better world at two wartime summits&#x2014;Teheran in November, 1943, and Yalta in February, 1945. These gestures would have meant little, though, had the troops they commanded not been able to stage their own more boisterous celebration where it really counted: on the front lines of a battlefield from which the enemy was now disappearing.</p><p>Why, then, did the armies at Torgau approach one another warily, as if they&#x2019;d been expecting interplanetary visitors? Why did the resemblances they saw seem so surprising&#x2014;and so reassuring? Why, despite these, did their commanders insist on separate surrender ceremonies, one for the western front at Reims, in France, on May 7th, another for the eastern front in Berlin on May 8th? Why did the Soviet authorities try to break up spontaneous pro-American demonstrations that erupted in Moscow following the official announcement of the German capitulation? Why did the American authorities, during the week that followed, abruptly suspend critical shipments of Lend-Lease aid to the U.S.S.R., and then resume them? Why did Roosevelt&#x2019;s key aide Harry Hopkins, who had played a decisive role in crafting the Grand Alliance in 1941, have to rush to Moscow six weeks after his boss&#x2019;s death to try to save it? Why for that matter, years later, would Churchill title his memoir of these events <i>Triumph and Tragedy</i>?</p><p>The answer to all of these questions is much the same: that the war had been won by a coalition whose principal members were already at war&#x2014;ideologically and geopolitically if not militarily&#x2014;with one another. Whatever the Grand Alliance&#x2019;s triumphs in the spring of 1945, its success had always depended upon the pursuit of compatible objectives by incompatible systems. The tragedy was this: that victory would require the victors either to cease to be who they were, or to give up much of what they had hoped, by fighting the war, to attain.</p><p><b> I.</b></p><p>HAD THERE really been an alien visitor on the banks of the Elbe in April, 1945, he, she, or it might indeed have detected superficial resemblances in the Russian and American armies that met there, as well as in the societies from which they had come. Both the United States and the Soviet Union had been born in revolution. Both embraced ideologies with global aspirations: what worked at home, their leaders assumed, would also do so for the rest of the world. Both, as continental states, had advanced across vast frontiers: they were at the time the first and third largest countries in the world. And both had entered the war as the result of surprise attack: the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on June 22, 1941, and the Japanese strike against Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which Hitler used as an excuse to declare war on the United States four days later. That would have been the extent of the similarities, though. The differences, as any terrestrial observer could have quickly pointed out, were much greater.</p><p>The American Revolution, which had happened over a century and a half earlier, reflected a deep distrust of concentrated authority. Liberty and justice, the Founding Fathers had insisted, could come only through constraining power. Thanks to an ingenious constitution, their geographical isolation from potential rivals, and a magnificent endowment of natural resources, the Americans managed to build an extraordinarily powerful state, a fact that became obvious during World War II. They accomplished this, however, by severely restricting their government&#x2019;s capacity to control everyday life, whether through the dissemination of ideas, the organization of the economy, or the conduct of politics. Despite the legacy of slavery, the near extermination of native Americans, and persistent racial, sexual, and social discrimination, the citizens of the United States could plausibly claim, in 1945, to live in the freest society on the face of the earth.</p><p>The Bolshevik Revolution, which had happened only a quarter century earlier, had in contrast involved the embrace of concentrated authority as a means of overthrowing class enemies and consolidating a base from which a proletarian revolution would spread throughout the world. Karl Marx claimed, in the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> of 1848, that the industrialization capitalists had set in motion was simultaneously expanding and exploiting the working class, which would sooner or later liberate itself. Not content to wait for this to happen, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin sought to accelerate history in 1917 by seizing control of Russia and imposing Marxism on it, even though that state failed to fit Marx&#x2019;s prediction that the revolution could only occur in an advanced industrial society. Stalin in turn fixed that problem by redesigning Russia to fit Marxist-Leninist ideology: he forced a largely agrarian nation with few traditions of liberty to become a heavily industrialized nation with no liberty at all. As a consequence, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was, at the end of World War II, the most authoritarian society anywhere on the face of the earth.</p><p>If the victorious nations could hardly have been more different, the same was true of the wars they had fought from 1941 to 1945. The United States waged separate wars simultaneously&#x2014;against the Japanese in the Pacific and the Germans in Europe&#x2014;but suffered remarkably few casualties: just under 300,000 Americans died in all combat theaters. Geographically distant from where the fighting was taking place, their country experienced no significant attacks apart from the initial one at Pearl Harbor. With its ally Great Britain (which suffered about 357,000 war deaths), the United States was able to choose where, when, and in what circumstances it would fight, a fact that greatly minimized the costs and risks of fighting. But unlike the British, the Americans emerged from the war with their economy thriving: wartime spending had caused their gross domestic product almost to double in less than four years. If there could ever be such a thing as a &#x201c;good&#x201d; war, then this one, for the United States, came close.</p><p>The Soviet Union enjoyed no such advantages. It waged only one war, but it was arguably the most terrible one in all of history. With its cities, towns, and countryside ravaged, its industries ruined or hurriedly relocated beyond the Urals, the only option apart from surrender was desperate resistance, on terrain and in circumstances chosen by its enemy. Estimates of casualties, civilian and military, are notoriously inexact, but it is likely that some 27 million Soviet citizens died as a direct result of the war&#x2014;roughly <i>90 times</i> the number of Americans who died. Victory could hardly have been purchased at greater cost: the U.S.S.R. in 1945 was a shattered state, fortunate to have survived. The war, a contemporary observer recalled, was &#x201c;both the most fearful and the proudest memory of the Russian people.&#x201d;2</p><p>When it came to shaping the postwar settlement, however, the victors were more evenly matched than these asymmetries might suggest. The United States had made no commitment to reverse its long-standing tradition of remaining aloof from European affairs&#x2014;Roosevelt had even assured Stalin, at Teheran, that American troops would return home within two years after the end of the war.3 Nor, given the depressing record of the 1930s, could there be any assurance that the wartime economic boom would continue, or that democracy would again take root beyond the relatively few countries in which it still existed. The stark fact that the Americans and the British could not have defeated Hitler without Stalin&#x2019;s help meant that World War II was a victory over fascism only&#x2014;not over authoritarianism and its prospects for the future.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Soviet Union had significant assets, despite the immense losses it had suffered. Because it was part of Europe, its military forces would not be withdrawing from Europe. Its command economy had shown itself capable of sustaining full employment when the capitalist democracies had failed, during the prewar years, to do so. Its ideology enjoyed widespread respect in Europe because communists there had largely led the resistance against the Germans. Finally, the disproportionate burden the Red Army had borne in defeating Hitler gave the U.S.S.R. a moral claim to substantial, perhaps even preponderant, influence in shaping the postwar settlement. It was at least as easy to believe, in 1945, that authoritarian communism was the wave of the future as that democratic capitalism was.</p><p>The Soviet Union had one other advantage as well, which was that it alone among the victors emerged from the war with tested leadership. Roosevelt&#x2019;s death on April 12, 1945, had catapulted his inexperienced and ill-informed vice president, Harry S. Truman, into the White House. Three months later, Churchill&#x2019;s unexpected defeat in the British general election made the far less formidable Labour Party leader, Clement Attlee, prime minister. The Soviet Union, in contrast, had Stalin, its unchallenged ruler since 1929, the man who remade his country and then led it to victory in World War II. Crafty, formidable, and to all appearances calmly purposeful, the Kremlin dictator knew what he wanted in the postwar era. Truman, Attlee, and the nations they led seemed much less certain.</p><p><b> II.</b></p><p>SO WHAT <i>did</i> Stalin want? It makes sense to start with him, because only he of the three postwar leaders had had the time, while retaining the authority, to consider and rank his priorities. Sixty-five at the end of the war, the man who ran the Soviet Union was phy...</p></p><h2>Cook&#39;s Illustrated Baking Book: Baking Demystified with 450 Foolproof Recipes from America&#39;s Most Trusted Food Magazine</h2><p><b>Baking demystified with 450 foolproof recipes from Cook's Illustrated, America's most trusted food magazine.</b><br><br><b>The&nbsp;<i>Cook&#x2019;s Illustrated Baking Book</i></b>&nbsp;has it all&#x2014;definitive recipes for all your favorite cookies, cakes, pies, tarts, breads, pizza, and more, along with kitchen-tested techniques that will transform your baking.

He became a symbol of America itself. He epitomized the Western film, which for many people epitomized America. He identified with conservative political causes from the early 1930s to his death in 1979, making him a hero to one generation of Americans and a villain to another. But unlike fellow actor Ronald Reagan, Wayne had no interest in politics as a career. Like many stars, he altered his life story, claiming to have become an actor almost by accident when in fact he had studied drama and aspired to act for most of his youth. He married three times, all to Latina women, and conducted a lengthy affair with Marlene Dietrich, as unlikely a romantic partner as one could imagine for the Duke. Wayne projected dignity, integrity, and strength in all his films, even when his characters were flawed, and whatever character he played was always prepared to confront injustice in his own way. More than thirty years after his death, he remains the standard by which male stars are judged and an actor whose morally unambiguous films continue to attract sizeable audiences.<br> <br>Scott Eyman interviewed Wayne, as well as many family members, and he has drawn on previously unpublished reminiscences from friends and associates of the Duke in this biography, as well as documents from his production company that shed light on Wayne&#x2019;s business affairs. He traces Wayne from his childhood to his stardom in <i>Stagecoach</i> and dozens of films after that. Eyman perceptively analyzes Wayne&#x2019;s relationship with John Ford, the director with whom he&#x2019;s most associated and who made some of Wayne&#x2019;s greatest films, among them <i>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</i>, <i>The Quiet Man</i>, and <i>The Searchers</i>. His evaluation of Wayne himself is shrewd: a skilled actor who was reluctant to step outside his comfort zone. Wayne was self-aware; he once said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve played the kind of man I&#x2019;d like to have been.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s that man and the real John Wayne who are brilliantly profiled in Scott Eyman&#x2019;s insightful biography of a true American legend.</p><p>Scott Eyman has written fifteen books, three of them <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>John Wayne: The Life and Legend</i>. His most recent book is <i>Hank and Jim</i>. He has been awarded the William K. Everson Award for Film History by the National Board of Review. He teaches film history at the University of Miami and lives in West Palm Beach with his wife, Lynn.John Wayne: The Life and Legend PROLOGUE<p></p> <br>The scene had a problem, and the problem was the gun.<br> <br>Dudley Nichols&#x2019;s script was specific: &#x201c;There is the sharp report of a rifle and Curly jerks up his gun as Buck saws wildly at the ribbons.<br> <br>&#x201c;The stagecoach comes to a lurching stop before a young man who stands in the road beside his unsaddled horse. He has a saddle over one arm and a rifle carelessly swung in the other hand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is Ringo&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;RINGO. You might need me and this Winchester. I saw a coupla ranches burnin&#x2019; last night.<br> <br>&#x201c;CURLY. I guess you don&#x2019;t understand, kid. You&#x2019;re under arrest.<br> <br>&#x201c;RINGO (with charm). I ain&#x2019;t arguing about that, Curly. I just hate to part with a gun like this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Holding it by the lever, he gives it a jerk and it cocks with a click&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>John Ford loved the dialogue, which was in and of itself unusual, but the introduction of the Ringo Kid needed to be emphasized. Ford decided that the shot would begin with the actor doing something with the gun, then the camera would rapidly track in from a full-length shot to an extreme close-up&#x2014;an unusually emphatic camera movement for the period, and an extremely unusual one for Ford, who had grown to prefer a stable camera.<br> <br>Since the actor was already coping with two large props, Ford decided to lose the horse. He told his young star what he was planning to do: &#x201c;Work out something with the rifle,&#x201d; Ford said. &#x201c;Or maybe just a pistol.&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t sure.<br> <br>And just like that the problem was dropped in the lap of his star, a young&#x2014;but not all that young&#x2014;actor named John Wayne, better known to Ford and everybody else as Duke.<br> <br>Wayne ran through the possibilities. Every actor in westerns could twirl a pistol, so that was out. Besides, the script specified a rifle cocked quickly with one hand, but later in the scene than what Ford was planning. In addition, Ford wanted him to do something flashy, but it couldn&#x2019;t happen too quickly for the audience to take it in. All the possibilities seemed to cancel each other out.<br> <br>And then Yakima Canutt, Wayne&#x2019;s friend and the stunt coordinator on the film, offered an idea. When Canutt was a boy he had seen Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s Wild West show. As the overland stage raced around the arena, a messenger trailing behind the stagecoach had carried a rifle with a large ring loop which allowed him to spin the rifle in the air, cocking it with one hand. The crowd went wild. Canutt said that it had been thirty years ago and he still remembered the moment. More to the point, he had never seen anybody else do it.<br> <br>Wayne sparked to the idea, as did Ford, but first they had to make it work. Ford instructed the prop department to manufacture a ring loop and install it on a standard-issue 1892 Winchester carbine. After the rifle was modified, Wayne began experimenting with the twirl move as Canutt remembered it, but there was a problem&#x2014;the barrel of the rifle was too long&#x2014;it wouldn&#x2019;t pass cleanly beneath Wayne&#x2019;s arm.<br> <br>The Winchester went back to the prop department, where they sawed an inch or so off the end, then soldered the sight back on the shortened barrel.1<br> <br>With that minor adjustment, the move was suddenly effortless. Wayne began rehearsing the twirling movement that would mark his entrance in the movie he had been waiting more than ten years to make&#x2014;a film for John Ford, his friend, his mentor, his idol, the man he called &#x201c;Coach&#x201d; or, alternately&#x2014;and more tellingly&#x2014;&#x201c;Pappy.&#x201d;<br> <br>With any luck at all, he&#x2019;d never have to go back to B westerns as long as he lived.<br> <br><br> <br>It&#x2019;s the late spring of 1939, and you&#x2019;re sitting in a theater watching Stagecoach. It&#x2019;s a western, not the most admired genre, and the cast is made up mostly of reliable character actors. But the reviews have been more than good, and John Ford has already achieved a measure of fame among critics and moviegoers.<br> <br>The first couple of minutes have already told you this is a movie made by filmmakers at the top of their game&#x2014;precise, emphatic compositions, perfect editing that never leaves a shot on-screen for less time than it needs to be understood, unforced exposition that expertly delineates seven major characters inside of twelve minutes.<br> <br>The story is basic. Seven strangers are crowded into a stagecoach, leaving a town called Tonto, heading through Indian territory to a town called Lordsburg. The seven people are traveling for seven different reasons, and the characters are deliberately contrasted in a way that goes beyond local color. A whore has a counterpart in a mousy, pregnant military bride; a pompous banker is balanced by a shady, dangerous gambler who can accurately gauge everybody&#x2019;s bad character, especially his own. Likewise, there is a meek little whiskey salesman who has to fend off a raucous alcoholic doctor.<br> <br>There is also a sheriff, a bluff, hearty man who seems to believe in appearances. And there is one other character we are told about but don&#x2019;t immediately meet: an outlaw lurking somewhere out there, beyond Tonto, beyond civilization. He has escaped from jail, and he too needs to get to Lordsburg, for a private mission of revenge, a mission that the sheriff has pledged to prevent.<br> <br>This collection of balanced opposites, the &#x201c;respectable&#x201d; confronted with the &#x201c;disreputable,&#x201d; populate the stagecoach, the vehicle through which John Ford will assert the moral equality of the outcast and restate his claim for the western as the seminal American film genre.<br> <br>The picture is eighteen minutes old when we finally meet the Ringo Kid. There is a gunshot off-camera, there is a location shot of the stagecoach quickly pulling up. Cut to a tall, lean man standing against a process background of Monument Valley with a saddle draped over one arm and a rifle in his other hand. The camera rushes in as he twirl-cocks the rifle with one hand.<br> <br>If you look at the rifle, it seems to be a tiny bit short, but nobody has ever looked at anything but the actor&#x2019;s face. Midway through the camera&#x2019;s rapid track-in, it loses focus for a half a second, then comes to rest in a huge, sharp close-up.<br> <br>It is a good face&#x2014;handsome but not pretty, assertive but not bullying. There are two beads of sweat coursing down his cheek, although whether that is a detail of character that Ford wanted or a result of the pressure of synchonizing a complicated physical movement with a complicated camera movement is lost to time.<br> <br>The camera gazes for a few long seconds on the face, letting us examine the blue eyes that photograph gray on black and white film, the shadow on the right side, the suggestion of sweat on the brow, the strength of the features. As the camera lingers, the intimidating aura of the Ringo Kid as outlined by the other characters dissolves. What we see is not a dangerous outlaw but a boyish young man in bold relief&#x2014;a gentle but resolute character.<br> <br>The actor leaps off the screen in a way the character doesn&#x2019;t in the script, and in a way the actor hadn&#x2019;t in his previous movies. This is an actor you have probably seen before, in one movie or another, but never like this, never showcased with such elemental force. John Wayne has been around the movies for more than ten years, first as a prop man, occasionally as an extra, then fronting a great widescreen spectacle of early sound that lost a great deal of money.<br> <br>Cast into oblivion by that film&#x2019;s failure, he made his way through the Depression with large parts in tiny films and tiny parts in large films. Before Stagecoach, he has appeared in more than eighty movies&#x2014;some good, most bad or indifferent.<br> <br>But with this scene&#x2014;no, with this moment&#x2014;looks, temperament, talent, part, and presentation collide and unite. The audience sees, truly sees John Wayne for the first time.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are not a culture that readily associates &#x2018;beauty&#x2019; with &#x2018;manly,&#x2019; &#x201d; wrote the critic Michael Ventura about this moment, &#x201c;but this face has that combination and something more:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an awareness of wilderness, a sense that here is a man meant to move in great spaces. That&#x2019;s vague, but that&#x2019;s the best I can do. Whitman has a line in &#x2018;Song of the Open Road&#x2019;: &#x2018;Here a great personal deed has room.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>To put it more bluntly: this is less an expertly choreographed entrance for an actor than it is the annunciation of a star. John Ford is telling us that this man warrants our attention in a way that transcends the immediate narrative of the movie.<br> <br>For the next forty years, John Wayne continually proved Ford&#x2019;s point. The literary theorist Roland Barthes wrote that &#x201c;Mass culture is a machine for showing desire,&#x201d; and successive generations desired John Wayne in a way shared by no other star of his generation.<br> <br>This was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. curious. Wayne was thirty-two years old when he made Stagecoach, and still possessed a youthful aura, but that was replaced by other things as he aged and expanded&#x2014;from reminding people of their brother or son, he gradually assumed a role as everyone&#x2019;s father, then, inevitably, as age and weight congealed, everyone&#x2019;s grandfather.<br> <br>None of that made much difference to his audience. For twenty-five out of twenty-six years&#x2014;1949 to 1974&#x2014;Wayne was in the list of top ten box-office stars. In nineteen of those years, he was in the top four. Thirty-five years after his death, he was still listed as one of America&#x2019;s five favorite movie stars. (The others on the list, Denzel Washington and Tom Cruise among them, had the considerable advantage of being alive.)<br> <br>Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, and Gary Cooper were all much bigger stars when Wayne began his ascent, but they have largely receded into the past. Wayne became more than a movie star for his time; rather, he became indivisibly associated with America itself, even if it was an America that was dead by the time he was born, and he was personifying a folklore easier to locate in the nineteenth century than the twentieth.<br> <br>Stagecoach was a picture that could and in fact did fall apart several times before it finally got made, and it got made only because of the determination of John Ford, who believed in John Wayne more than John Wayne believed in himself. Ford was born John Martin Feeney in Maine in 1894, and by the time he met Duke Morrison in 1926, Ford&#x2014;he took the screen name of his brother, the actor Francis Ford&#x2014;had been directing movies for ten years and had already made his first great film: The Iron Horse.<br> <br>In the succeeding years, Ford was drawn by the young man&#x2019;s inexhaustible energy, his willingness to do anything asked of him. For Duke Morrison enthusiastically adopted the perpetual challenge of a big man with ambition&#x2014;to do everything better, harder, longer than anyone else.<br> <br>&#x201c;On every picture, there is at least one day when nothing seems to go right,&#x201d; Ford said. &#x201c;When things are going wrong, Duke is a mighty fine man to have around. He will run half the length of the valley to tell the second unit that we are planning to shoot another take. He rarely asks a man to do a job he can do himself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Other co-workers concurred, and valued Wayne for his willingness to extend himself far beyond the limited portfolio of an actor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen him put his shoulder to a location wagon that was stuck,&#x201d; said the cameraman Bert Glennon, &#x201c;or hold a pair of shears and a comb for a hairdresser when she had to make a hurried change on one of the characters.&#x201d;<br> <br>This never changed. Thirty-six years after Stagecoach, he made The Shootist, his last movie. The scene: a dying gunfighter named J. B. Books goes to a barbershop.<br> <br>As Wayne settled himself into the barber chair for the scene, a prop man began to cut thin strands of fake hair and arrange them around the perimeter of the chair. Wayne and Alfred Dennis, the actor playing the barber, began to run their lines. Wayne stopped and watched what the prop man was doing.<br> <br>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t work,&#x201d; said the star.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not cutting off enough hair. The camera is ten feet away. It won&#x2019;t read the little hairs that you&#x2019;re cutting off. Give it to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wayne grabbed the prop hair and scissors and began chopping off giant hunks of hair, four and five inches long, throwing them around the barber chair. Rationally, these chunks would come from a man with shoulder-length hair, but Wayne knew that when it comes to movies, the eye is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is what the lens sees.<br> <br>The young prop man didn&#x2019;t know that Wayne began his career as a prop man, and wasn&#x2019;t about to lower his standards. In all the reviews and analyses of the picture then and later, the huge hunks of hair at the bottom of the barber chair always go unnoticed.<br> <br>John Wayne always knew what the camera would see; he always knew what the audience would believe.<br> <br><br> <br>John Ford was profoundly Irish in every possible way, and his character was accompanied by an assortment of more or less symptomatic demons. He was defensive, in total control of his art, if not his life, and he was some sort of genius. &#x201c;He was talented, and he was intolerable,&#x201d; was the succinct opinion of Maureen O&#x2019;Hara.<br> <br>Andre de Toth, a director whom Ford promoted, said, &#x201c;He was not a social person. He kept to his boat, to the studio, and to his Jack Daniel&#x2019;s. There wasn&#x2019;t a lot of dialogue in his life, and there wasn&#x2019;t a lot of dialogue in his movies.<br> <br>&#x201c;He was making motion pictures. He was sure of the art he wanted to make, but not much else. People put up with Jack Ford for one reason: he always told you what he thought was the truth. That&#x2019;s what you see in a Ford film: honesty.&#x201d;<br> <br>In contrast to the largely impenetrable and essentially solitary Ford, Wayne had few obvious demons. He drank&#x2014;but never allowed it to control his life or interfere with his work. He smoked incessantly, ate what he wanted, enjoyed the company of women, adored the company of men. He was like his mentor in one way only: he invariably said what he thought.<br> <br>Ford had bought Ernest Haycox&#x2019;s original story for Stagecoach in 1936 and circled the idea of making his former prop man the star of a western. After flirtations with a couple of other actors, he made up his mind: Duke would be the Ringo Kid.<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t enough for an actor to look the part and say his lines well,&#x201d; said Ford. &#x201c;Something else has to come across to audiences&#x2014;something which no director can instill or create&#x2014;the quality of being a real man.&#x201d;<br> <br>Wayne embodied one other quality Ford needed: &#x201c;He was the only person I could think of at the time who could personify great strength and determination without talking much. That sounds easy, perhaps. But it&#x2019;s not. Either you have it or you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>Like all excellent directors only more so, Ford was a manipulator, a man capable of thinking on three or four levels at once, and he enjoyed Wayne because the actor was completely different than he was. Wayne was a creature of spontaneity, with a bubbling enthusiasm for every new project and for life itself, and little interest in the contemplation of mistakes, of roads not taken. The most important movie of Wayne&#x2019;s life was always the next one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Duke has always been able to enjoy life&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to swallow and digest it in big, unchewed pieces. Depending upon the circumstances, he can be a roughneck, or a perfect gentleman. He&#x2019;s my boy, always has been; always wil...</p><h2>A Taste of Georgia</h2><p>A GREAT COOKBOOK PROVIDED FROM THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF GEORGIA FULL OF RECIPES</p><p></p><h2>Sams Sandwich</h2><p>Sam&#39;s sister wants a sandwich ... but sneaky Sam can&#39;t wait to add a few wriggling surprises of his own.

He lives in London.Once they feast their eyes on the exterior of this mouth-watering volume, youngsters will be impatient to dig in. The front and back covers are designed--quite convincingly--to resemble pieces of bread, and the spine reveals the neatly layered ingredients of the special snack Sam prepares for his sister. The most delectable morsels, however, are found within--each spread depicts one of the foods the obliging brother adds to his culinary creation. But the realistic renditions of sliced tomato, cucumber, cheese, pastrami, onion and hard-boiled egg fold out to disclose some of Sam's secret--and less appetizing--additions, including a fly, worm, slug, caterpillar and some ants. Youngsters will be too engrossed in Sam's creative sandwich-making to notice that Pelham's singsong rhyme occasionally falters. This cleverly designed book accomplishes what it sets out to do: it serves up a tasty little snack rather than a full-course meal.

Seraphina has spent her young life concealing the truth of her parentage and authentic nature, a task that proves ever more difficult when she is thrust into the spotlight of the royal court. Author Rachel Hartman&#x2019;s dragons take human form but shun the messiness of human emotion by remaining &#x201c;in ard&#x201d; (a highly rational state of mind), while their counterparts cling to a dangerous assumption of species superiority. As the anniversary of the treaty between the two sides approaches, court intrigue reaches a fever pitch and hard-won truths, betrayals, and intricacies of the heart are laid bare. <i>Seraphina</i> is a beautifully complex fantasy that delves into the most basic of desires&#x2014;to be loved, to belong, and to find peace in self-acceptance. --<i>Seira Wilson</i> <br><br> <p><b> Guest Review by Tamora Pierce</b></p> <p> <strong>Tamora Pierce is a best-selling author of fantasy books for teenagers. Her books, known for their teenaged girl warriors and wizards, have received critical acclaim and a strong fanbase. Her newest book, <em>Mastiff</em>, is the third book in The Legend of Beka Cooper series.</strong></p> <p> In Seraphina's world, coldly intellectual dragons can take on the shapes--and feelings--of human beings. Sometimes this results in a surprise. Seraphina's father married a beautiful musician, and discovered too late that she was a dragon. She died, leaving him with a daughter who confuses him and his new wife and children.</p> <p> Now the half-dragon Seraphina is the assistant to the cranky royal music master. She is in charge of Princess Glisselda's music lessons; she books performers for the 40-year celebration of the peace treaty between dragons and humans, and she rehearses the rowdy court musicians. She has to hide the scales on her arm and around her waist, and she can never let anyone find out that Orma, her music teacher, is actually a dragon.</p> <p> When she plays the solo for the funeral of the realm's murdered prince, Seraphina is suddenly raised into entirely new, visible levels of peril. People she always avoided are noticing her. She has to attend social functions, where she is caught up in court politics, between those who support the treaty and those who want to destroy it. She runs afoul of conspirators who want to start the war again--one of them may be her own grandfather. She even discovers that Prince Lucian, who is betrothed to Princess Glisselda, is not only very sharp-eyed but also very agreeable to be around. He appreciates her insights on intrigue at court and in the city and uses her as an unofficial investigator into the ongoing unrest.</p> <p> The plot thickens. A new religious order plots riots and revolution. Exiled knights return to report an unregulated dragon flying near where the old prince was murdered. The dragons are trying to send Orma for corrective surgery--they think he's gotten too human and they want to cut those parts out of his brain. Seraphina fears that if she tells the prince and the princess what she is, they'll hate her forever, but their work to preserve the treaty celebrations is bringing them closer together. And all of them are terrified that the dragons will decide that humans are not worth the trouble, and will destroy them at last.</p> <p>I loved this book even more the second time I read it than I did the first. The characters are interesting and engaging, and I love the new look at dragons. For all that she's half-dragon, Seraphina is a very believable human being, caught between different loyalties and just trying to keep everyone she loves alive.

In Disappointment with God, he poses three questions that Christians wonder but seldom ask aloud: Is God unfair? Is he silent? Is he hidden? This insightful and deeply personal book points to the odd disparity between our concept of God and the realities of life. Why, if God is so hungry for relationship with us, does he seem so distant? Why, if he cares for us, do bad things happen? What can we expect from him after all? Yancey answers these questions with clarity, richness, and biblical assurance. He takes us beyond the things that make for disillusionment to a deeper faith, a certitude of God's love, and a thirst to reach not just for what God gives, but for who he is.</p></p><p>Is God unfair?

He worked as a copywriter for various advertising agencies in New York before embarking on a career as a novelist. He is married, has two children, and now lives in Mill Valley, California.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br>Is shirt-sleeves, the way I generally worked, I sat sketching a bar of soap taped to an upper corner of my drawing board. The gold-foil wrapper was carefully peeled back so that you could still read most of the brand name printed on it; I'd spoiled the wrappers of half a dozen bars before getting that effect. This was a new idea, the product to be shown ready for what the accompanying copy called "fragrant, lathery, lovelier <i>you"</i> use, and I had the job of sketching it into half a dozen layouts, the bar of soap at a slightly different angle in each.<br><br>It was just exactly as boring as it sounds, and I stopped to look out the window beside me, down twelve stories at Fifty-fourth Street and the little heads moving along the sidewalk. It was a sunny, sharply clear day in mid-November, and I'd have liked to be out in it, the whole afternoon ahead and nothing to do; nothing I had to do, that is.<br><br>Over at the paste-up table Vince Mandel, our lettering man, thin and dark and probably feeling as caged-up today as I was, stood working with the airbrush, a cotton surgical mask over his mouth. He was spraying a flesh-colored film onto a <i>Life</i> magazine photo of a girl in a bathing suit. The effect, when he finished, would be to remove the suit, leaving the girl apparently naked except for the ribbon she wore slanted from shoulder to waist on which was lettered MISS BUSINESS MACHINES. This kind of stunt was Vince's favorite at-work occupation ever since he'd thought of it, and the retouched picture would be added to a collection of others like it on the art-department bulletin board, at which Maureen, our nineteen-year-old paste-up girl and messenger, refused ever to look or even glance, though often urged.<br><br>Frank Dapp, our art director, a round little package of energy, came trotting toward his partitioned-off office in the northeast comer of the artists' bullpen. As he passed the big metal supply cabinet just inside the room he hammered violently on its open door, yodeling at full bellow. It was an habitual release of unused energy like a locomotive jetting steam, a starting eruption of sound. But neither Vince nor I nor Karl Jonas at the board ahead of mine glanced up. Neither did anyone in the typists' pool outside, I knew, although strangers waiting in the art-department reception room just down the hall had been known to leap to their feet at the sound.<br><br>It was an ordinary day, a Friday, twenty minutes till lunchtime, five hours till quitting time and the weekend, ten months till vacation, thirty-seven years till retirement. Then the phone rang.<br><br>"Man here to see you, Si." It was Vera, at the switchboard. "He has no appointment."<br><br>"That's okay. He's my connection; I need a fix."<br><br>"What you need can't be fixed." She clicked off. I got up, wondering who it was; an artist in an advertising agency doesn't usually have too many visitors. The main reception room was on the floor below, and I took the long route through Accounting and Media, but no new girls had been hired.<br><br>Frank Dapp called the main reception room Off Broadway. It was decorated with a genuine Oriental rug, several display cases of antique silver from the collection of the wife of one of the three partners, and with a society matron whose hair was also antique silver and who relayed visitors' requests to Vera. As I walked toward it my visitor stood looking at one of the framed ads hung on the walls. Something I don't like admitting and which I've learned to disguise is a shyness about meeting people, and now I felt the familiar slight apprehension and momentary confusion as he turned at the sound of my approaching footsteps. He was bald and short, the top of his head reaching only to my eye level, and I'm an inch short of six feet. He looked about thirty-five, I thought, walking toward him, and he was remarkably thick-chested; he'd outweigh me without being fat. He wore an olive-green gabardine suit that didn't go with his pink redhead's complexion. <i>I hope he's not a salesman,</i> I thought; then he smiled as I stepped into the lobby, a real smile, and I liked him instantly and relaxed. <i>No,</i> I told myself, <i>he's not selling anything,</i> and I couldn't have been more wrong about that.<br><br>"Mr. Morley?" I nodded, smiling back at him. "Mr. Simon Morley?" he said, as though there might be several of us Morleys here at the agency and he wanted to be certain.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>He still wasn't satisfied. "Just for fun, do you remember your army serial number?" He took my elbow and began walking me out into the elevator corridor away from the receptionist.<br><br>I rattled it off; it didn't even occur to me to wonder why I was doing this for a stranger, no questions asked.<br><br>"Right!" he said approvingly, and I felt pleased. We were out in the corridor now, no one else around.<br><br>"Are you from the army? If so, I don't want any today."<br><br>He smiled, but didn't answer the question, I noticed. He said, "I'm Ruben Prien," and hesitated momentarily as though I might recognize the name, then continued. "I should have phoned and made an appointment; but I'm in a hurry so I took a chance on dropping in."<br><br>"That's all right, I wasn't doing anything but working. What can I do for you?"<br><br>He grimaced humorously at the difficulty of what he had to say. "I've got to have about an hour of your time. Right now, if you can manage it." He looked embarrassed. "I'm sorry, but...if you could just take me on faith for a little while, I'd appreciate it."<br><br>I was hooked; he had my interest. "All right. It's ten to twelve; would you like to have lunch? I can leave a little early."<br><br>"Fine, but let's not talk indoors. We could pick up some sandwiches and eat in the park. Okay? It's not too cool."<br><br>Nodding, I said, "I'll get my coat and meet you here. You interest me strangely." I stood hesitating, looking closely at this pleasant, tough-looking, bald little man, then said it. "As I think you know. Matter of fact, you've been through this whole routine before, haven't you? Complete with embarrassed look."<br><br>He grinned and made a little finger-snapping motion. "And I thought I really had it down. Well, it's back to the mirror, and more practice. Get your coat; we're losing time."<br><br>We walked north on Fifth Avenue past the incredible buildings of glass and steel, glass and enameled metal, glass and marble, and the older ones of more stone than glass. It's a stunning street and unbelievable; I never get used to it, and I wonder if anyone really does. Is there any other place where an entire cloud bank can be completely reflected in the windows of one wall of only one building, and with room to spare? Today I especial??? enjoyed being out on Fifth, the temperature in the high 50's, a nice late-fall coolness in the air. It was nearly noon, and beautiful girls came dancing out of every office building we passed, and I thought of how regrettable it was that I'd never know or even speak to most of them. The little bald man beside me said, "I'll tell you what I've come to say to you; then I'll listen to questions. Maybe I'll even answer some. But everything I can really tell you I will have said before we reach Fifty-sixth Street. I've done this thirty-odd times now, and never figured out a good way to say it or even sound very sane while trying, so here goes.<br><br>"There's a project. A U.S. government project I guess you'd have to call it. Secret, naturally; as what isn't in government these days? In my opinion, and that of a handful of others, it's more important than all the nuclear, space-exploration, satellite, and rocket programs put together, though a hell of a lot smaller. I tell you right off that I can't even hint what the project is about. And believe me, you'd never guess. I can and do say that nothing human beings have ever before attempted in the entire nutty history of the race even approaches this in absolute fascination. When I first understood what this project is about I didn't sleep for two nights, and I don't mean that in the usual way; I mean I literally did not sleep. And before I could sleep on the third night I had to have a shot in the arm, and I'm supposed to be the plodding unimaginative type. Do I have your attention?"<br><br>"Yes; if I understand you, you've finally discovered something more interesting than sex."<br><br>"You may find out that you're not exaggerating. I think riding to the moon would be almost dull in comparison to what you may just possibly have a chance to do. It is the greatest possible adventure. I would give anything I own or will ever have just to be in your shoes; I'd give years of my life just for a <i>chance</i> at this. And that's it, friend Morley. I can go on talking, and will, but that's really all I have to say. Except this: through no virtue or merit of your own, just plain dumb luck, you are invited to join the project. To commit yourself to it. Absolutely blind. That's some pig in a poke, all right, but oh, my God, what a pig. There's a pretty good delicatessen on Fifty-seventh Street; what kind of sandwiches you want?"<br><br>"Roast pork, what else?"<br><br>We bought our sandwiches and a couple of apples, then walked on toward Central Park a couple of blocks ahead. Prien was waiting for some sort of reply, and we walked in silence for half a block; then I shrugged irritably, wanting to be polite but not knowing how else to answer. "What am I supposed to say?"<br><br>"Whatever you want."<br><br>"All right; why me?"<br><br>"Well, I'm glad you asked, as the politicians say. There is a particular kind of man we need. He has to have a certain set of qualities. A rather special list of qualities, actually, and a long list. Furthermore, he has to have them in a pretty exact kind of balance. We didn't know that at first. We thought most any intelligent eager young fellow would do. Me, for example. Now we know, or think we do, that he has to be physically right, psychologically right, temperamentally right. He has to have a certain special way of looking at things. He's got to have the ability, and it seems to be fairly rare, to see things as they are and at the same time as they might have been. If that makes any sense to you. It probably does, because it may be that what we mean is the eye of an artist. Those are just some of what he must have or be; there are others I won't tell you about now. Trouble is that on one count or another that seems to eliminate most of the population. The only practical way we've found to turn up likely candidates is to plow through the tests the army gave its inductees; you remember them."<br><br>"Vaguely."<br><br>"I don't know how many sets of those tests have been analyzed; that's not my department. Probably millions. They use computers for the early check-throughs, eliminating all those that are comfortably wide of the mark. Which is most of them. After that, real live people take over; we don't want to miss even one candidate. Because we're finding damn few. We've checked I don't know how many millions of service records, including the women's branches. For some reason women seem to produce more candidates than men; we wish we had more we could check. Anyway, one Simon L. Morley with the fine euphonious serial number looks like a candidate. How come you only made PFC?"<br><br>"A lack of talent for idiocies such as close-order drill."<br><br>"I believe the technical term is two left feet. Out of fewer than a hundred possibilities we've found so far, about fifty have already heard what you're hearing now, and turned us down. About fifty more have volunteered, and over forty of them flunked some further tests. Anyway, after one hell of a lot of work, we have five men and two women who just might be qualified. Most or all of them will fail in the actual attempt; we don't have even one we feel very sure of. We'd like to get about twenty-five candidates, if we possibly can. We'd like a hundred, but we don't believe there are that many around; at least we don't know how to find them. But you may be one."<br><br>"Gee whiz."<br><br>At Fifty-ninth Street as we stood waiting for the light, I glanced at Rube's profile and said, "Rube Prien; yeah. You played football. When was it? About ten years ago."<br><br>He turned to grin up at me. "You remembered! You're a good boy; I wish I'd bought you some thick gooey dessert, the kind I can't eat anymore. Only it was fifteen years ago; I'm not really the young handsome youth I know I must seem."<br><br>"Where'd you play again? I can't remember."<br><br>The light clicked green, and we stepped down off the curb. "West Point."<br><br>"I knew it! You're in the army!"<br><br>"Yep."<br><br>I was shaking my head. "Well, I'm sorry, but it'll take more than you. It'll take five husky fighting MPs to drag me back in, kicking and screaming all the way. Whatever you're selling and however fascinating, I don't want any. The lure of sleepless nights in the army just isn't enough, Prien; I've already had all I want."<br><br>On the other side of the street we stepped up onto the sidewalk, crossed it, then turned onto the curve of a dirt-and-gravel path of Central Park and walked along it looking for an empty bench. "What's wrong with the army?" Rube said with fake injured innocence.<br><br>"You said this would take an hour; I'd need a week just for the chapter headings."<br><br>"All right, <i>don't</i> join the army. Join the navy; we'll make you anything you like from bosun's mate to lieutenant senior grade. Or join the De partment of the Interior; you can be a forester with your very own Smokey-the-Bear hat." Prien was enjoying himself. "Sign up with the post office if you want; we'll make you an assistant inspector and give you a badge and the power to arrest for postal fraud. I mean it; pick almost any branch of the government you like except State or the diplomatic corps. And pick any title you fancy at no more than around a twelve-thousand-a-year salary, and so long as it isn't an elective office. Because, Si -- all right to call you Si?" he said with sudden impatience.<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"And call me Rube, if you care to. Si, it doesn't matter what payroll you're technically on. When I say this is secret, I mean it; our budget is scattered through the books of every sort of department and bureau, our people listed on every roster but our own. We don't officially exist, and yes, I'm still a member of the U.S. Army. The time counts toward my retirement, and besides I like the army, eccentric as I know that sounds. But my uniforms are in storage, I salute nobody these days, and the man I take a lot of my orders from is an historian on leave from Columbia University. Be a little chilly on the benches in the shade; let's find a place in the sun."<br><br>We picked a place a dozen yards off the path beside a big outcropping of black rock. We sat down on the sunny side, leaning back against the warm rock, and began opening our sandwiches. To the south, east, and west the New York buildings rose high, hanging over the park's edges like a gang ready to rush in and cover the greenery with concrete.<br><br>"You must have been in grade school when you read about Flying Rube Prien, deer-footed quarterback."<br><br>"I guess so; I'm twenty-eight." I bit into my sandwich. It was very good, the meat sliced thin and packed thick, the fat trimmed.<br><br>Rube said, "Twenty-eight on March eleventh."<br><br>"So you know that, do you? Well, goody goody gumshoes."<br><br>"It's in your army record, of course. But we know some things that aren't; we know you were divorced two years ago, and why."<br><br>"Would you mind telling me? I never did figure out why."<br><br>"You wouldn't understand. We also know that in about the last five months you've gone out with nine women but only four of them more than once.

Dick Reader</h2><p><b>Includes the stories that inspired the movies <i>Total Recall, Screamers, Minority Report, Paycheck</i>, and <i>Next</i></b><p>&#x201c;More than anyone else in the field, Mr. Dick really puts you inside people&#x2019;s minds.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p><b>The Philip K. Dick Reader</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many thousands of readers consider Philip K. Dick the greatest science fiction mind on any planet. Since his untimely death in 1982, interest in Dick&#x2019;s works has continued to mount, and his reputation has been further enhanced by a growing body of critical attention. The Philip K. Dick Award is now given annually to a distinguished work of science fiction, and the Philip K. Dick Society is devoted to the study and promulgation of his works.</p><p>Dick won the prestigious Hugo Award for the best novel of 1963 for <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>. In the last year of his life, the film Blade Runner was made from his novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i></p><p>This collection includes some of Dick&#x2019;s earliest short and medium-length fiction, including <i>We Can Remember It for You Wholesale </i>(the story that inspired the motion picture <i>Total Recall</i>), <i>Second Variety </i>(which inspired the motion picture <i>Screamers</i>), <i>Paycheck, The Minority Report</i>, and twenty more.</p></p><p>His religions, psychoses, divorces, and drug use aside, Philip K. Dick changed the face of American science fiction with his mind-bending writing. There may be readers who have only heard of him as the mind behind <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on his novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>). But even casual PKD fans should take a look at these 24 short stories, among them, "Second Variety," from which the movie <i>Screamers</i> was made, and "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale," basis of the Schwarzenegger film <i>Total Recall</i>. Other standouts include "The Turning Wheel," "The Last of the Masters," "Tony and the Beetles," and "The Minority Report." Readers will recognize PKD's trademark themes: capitalism and the American dream run amok, a disquieting loss of ability to distinguish friends from enemies, and humans versus machines.<p> Since Philip K. Dick's heyday, and thanks in large part to his influence, the contemporary science fiction short story has evolved into a form more self-reflective and psychologically complex. This is a wonderful development, to be sure. But don't regard the older stories in this collection as dated. Instead, enjoy the peppery punch: PKD's stories provide plenty of plot twists and surprise endings. <i>--Bonnie Bouman</i></p>More than 30 years after his untimely death at age 53, <b>Philip K. Dick</b> (1928 &#x2013; 1982) remains one of the most celebrated authors of the last century and a looming and illuminating presence in this one. He was the winner of both the prestigious Hugo Award and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, which honor excellence in science fiction. Inducted in 2007 into the Library of America, which publishes a three-volume collection of his novels, Dick has received unprecedented recognition for his contributions to modern literature, specifically in the area of science fiction. His 45 novels and over 210 short stories have been adapted into numerous films, including the blockbusters <i><i>Minority Report, Total Recall</i></i>, and <i><i>Blade Runner</i></i>, as well as <i><i>Impostor, Paycheck, Scanner Darkly, Next</i></i>, and <i><i>The Adjustment Bureau</i>.</i></p><h2>Frozen in Time: An Epic Story of Survival and a Modern Quest for Lost Heroes of World War II</h2><p><p><strong>#1 <em>New York Times </em>bestseller!</strong></p><p><em>Frozen in Time</em> is a gripping true story of survival, bravery, and honor in the vast Arctic wilderness during World War II, from the author of <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>Lost in Shangri-La</em>.</p><p>On November 5, 1942, a US cargo plane slammed into the Greenland Ice Cap. Four days later, the B-17 assigned to the search-and-rescue mission became lost in a blinding storm and also crashed. Miraculously, all nine men on board survived, and the US military launched a daring rescue operation. But after picking up one man, the Grumman Duck amphibious plane flew into a severe storm and vanished.</p><p><em>Frozen in Time </em>tells the story of these crashes and the fate of the survivors, bringing vividly to life their battle to endure 148 days of the brutal Arctic winter, until an expedition headed by famed Arctic explorer Bernt Balchen brought them to safety. Mitchell Zuckoff takes the reader deep into the most hostile environment on earth, through hurricane-force winds, vicious blizzards, and subzero temperatures.</p><p>Moving forward to today, he recounts the efforts of the Coast Guard and North South Polar Inc. &#x2013; led by indefatigable dreamer Lou Sapienza &#x2013; who worked for years to solve the mystery of the Duck&#x2019;s last flight and recover the remains of its crew.</p><p>A breathtaking blend of mystery and adventure Mitchell Zuckoff's <em>Frozen in Time: An Epic Story of Survival and a Modern Quest for Lost Heroes of World War II </em>is also a poignant reminder of the sacrifices of our military personnel and a tribute to the everyday heroism of the US Coast Guard.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2013</strong>: Talk about bad luck: In 1942, a United States cargo plane crash-landed while flying over Greenland, stranding the crew on sea of ice. A rescue flight was quickly dispatched--it crashed in a November storm, stranding its own nine crewmembers. The third time was not the charm: a second rescue mission disappeared in another blizzard, leaving neither clues nor apparent survivors. Subsequent attempts--some with fatal results--failed under the harsh conditions, forcing the men to weather the Arctic winter in makeshift shelters, including the tail section of a broken bomber. This tale of survival in the deadliest conditions would be enthralling on its own (and it is), but Zuckoff's meticulous research led him to a modern-day group dedicated to solving the mystery of the third flight. As a chronicler of their mission, Zuckoff is swept into their adventure, and his project becomes much more than an interesting World War II subplot. Part <i>Alive</i>, part Shackleton, <i>Frozen in Time</i> is a thrilling story of courage, perseverance, and loyalty that spans decades. --<i>Jon Foro</i>This book tells two true stories, one from the past and one from the present.<br><br>The historic story revolves around three American military planes that crashed in Greenland during World War II. First, a C-53 cargo plane slammed into the island's vast ice cap. All five men aboard survived the crash, and their distress calls triggered an urgent search. Next to go down was one of the search planes, a B-17 bomber, stranding nine more men on the ice. Finally, a Coast Guard rescue plane called a Grumman Duck vanished in a storm with three men aboard while trying to save the B-17 crew.<br><br>For nearly five months, through the Arctic winter of 1942-43, survivors and their would-be saviors fought to stay alive and sane in the most hostile environment on earth, clinging to life in snow caves and the tail section of the B-17. As the war raged on, America's military tried to rescue the icebound men by land, sea, and air, sometimes with fatal results. When hope seemed lost, a legendary aviator from the early days of flight devised a half-mad plan to land a seaplane on a glacier.<br><br>I learned about these events while hunting through newspaper archives for hidden treasures: stories that once captivated the world, only to fall through the cracks of history. After too many brassiere ads to count, I came across a 1943 series of newspaper articles titled "The Long Wait," about the crew of the wrecked B-17. Intrigued, I dug deeper, collecting declassified documents, maps, photographs, interviews, and previously unknown journals, seeking critical mass for a book.<br><br>Along the way, I stumbled upon a loose-knit society of men and women determined to locate the Grumman Duck's resting place and to bring home the remains of the three heroes it carried. Driving that effort was a tireless dreamer named Lou Sapienza, a photographer-turned-explorer who dedicated himself physically, financially, and emotionally to finding the frozen tomb of three men he knew only from faded photographs. Through Lou and his cohorts I met families who'd been waiting nearly seven decades for the return of their lost loved ones.<br><br>I also connected with Duck-devoted Coast Guardsmen who believed that all hands should be present and accounted for, one way or another. One in particular, Commander Jim Blow, committed himself with the same fervor he once gave to his work as a search-and-rescue pilot. Soon I realized that I couldn't tell the full story of the three crashes without also writing about the modern mission of the Duck Hunt.<br><br>In the summer of 2012 I joined Lou, Jim, and their combined civilian and military teams on a remote glacier in Greenland, where we experienced the world's unfinished attic firsthand. Together we used cutting-edge technology, an overlooked military crash report, and a yellowed treasure map complete with an X to solve one of the last mysteries from World War II.<br><br>Although written as a narrative, this is a work of nonfiction. As explained in my notes on sources, I took no liberties with facts, dialogue, characters, details, or chronology. Because the story moves between past and present, date markers such as "November 1942" and "October 2011" signal which tale is being told. Also, the historical story is written in past tense, while the modern story is in present tense.<br><br>I played a role in the Duck Hunt, and I appear in the book, but it isn't about me. It's about ordinary people thrust by fate or duty into extraordinary circumstances, one group in 1942 and another group seventy years later. Separated by time but connected by character, their bravery, endurance, and sacrifices reveal the power of humanity in inhumane conditions. I hope I've done them justice.</p><h2>Rough Riders: Theodore Roosevelt, His Cowboy Regiment, and the Immortal Charge Up San Juan Hill</h2><p><p><strong>The award-winning, new definitive history of Teddy Roosevelt and the legendary&nbsp;Rough Riders</strong></p><p><strong>"Thrilling. ...

And when, on the boy&#39;s behalf, Tom Ripley is drawn from his lovely estate in the French countryside to Berlin&#39;s seamy underworld and into a kidnapping plot that requires the most bizarre methods--and sinister acumen--for intervention, the icily amoral Ripley is transformed into a generous and compassionate projector.</p><p>Patricia Highsmith (1921 &#x2013; 1995) was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and grew up in New York. She was educated at the Julia Richmond High School in Manhattan and then at Columbia University, where she earned her B.A. in 1942. Her first novel, <b>Strangers on a Train</b> (1950), tells the story of a tennis player and a psychotic who meet on a train and agree to swap murders. The terrifying tale caught the attention of director Alfred Hitchcock, who, with Raymond Chandler, filmed it in 1951. Both the book and the resulting movie are considered to be classics of the crime genre. Highsmith&#x2019;s subsequent novels, particularly five featuring the dashing forger/murderer Tom Ripley, have been vastly popular and critically acclaimed. In 1957 Highsmith won the coveted French Grand Prix de Litterature Policiere and in 1964 was awarded the Silver Dagger by the British Crime Writers Association. A reclusive person, Highsmith spent much of her life alone. She moved permanently to Europe in 1963 and spent her final years in an isolated house near Locarno on the Swiss-Italian border. Upon her death, Highsmith left three million dollars of her estate to Yaddo, the artist community in upstate New York.To coincide with the premiere of the paperback publication of 1992's Ripley Under Water ( LJ 10/1/92), Vintage is releasing a brace of Highsmith's earlier adventures of Ripley, the cordial young man with the talent for murder.

With only two boatloads of his scraggly band of Vermont volunteers having made it across the wind-whipped waters of Lake Champlain, he was waiting for the rest of his Green Mountain boys to arrive. But with the protective darkness quickly fading, Allen determined that he hold off no longer.<br><br> While Ethan Allen, a canonical hero of the American Revolution, has always been defined by his daring, predawn attack on the British-controlled Fort Ticonderoga, Willard Sterne Randall, the author of <em>Benedict Arnold</em>, now challenges our conventional understanding of this largely unexamined Founding Father. Widening the scope of his inquiry beyond the Revolutionary War, Randall traces Allen&#x2019;s beginning back to his modest origins in Connecticut, where he was born in 1738. Largely self-educated, emerging from a relatively impoverished background, Allen demonstrated his deeply rebellious nature early on through his attraction to Deism, his dramatic defense of smallpox vaccinations, and his early support of separation of church and state.<br><br> Chronicling Allen&#x2019;s upward struggle from precocious, if not unruly, adolescent to commander of the largest American paramilitary force on the eve of the Revolution, Randall unlocks a trove of new source material, particularly evident in his gripping portrait of Allen as a British prisoner-of-war. While the biography reacquaints readers with the familiar details of Allen&#x2019;s life&#x2015;his capture during the aborted American invasion of Canada, his philosophical works that influenced Thomas Paine, his seminal role in gaining Vermont statehood, his stirring funeral in 1789&#x2015;Randall documents that so much of what we know of Allen is mere myth, historical folklore that people have handed down, as if Allen were Paul Bunyan.<br><br> As Randall reveals, Ethan Allen, a so-called Robin Hood in the eyes of his dispossessed Green Mountain settlers, aggrandized, and unabashedly so, the holdings of his own family, a fact that is glossed over in previous accounts, embellishing his own best-selling prisoner-of-war narrative as well. He emerges not only as a public-spirited leader but as a self-interested individual, often no less rapacious than his archenemies, the New York land barons of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys.<br><br> As John E. Ferling comments, &#x201c;Randall has stripped away the myths to provide as accurate an account of Allen&#x2019;s life as will ever be written.&#x201d; The keen insights that he produces shed new light, not only on this most enigmatic of Founding Fathers, but on today&#x2019;s descendants of the Green Mountain Boys, whose own political disenfranchisement resonates now more than ever. 16 pages of illustrations</p><p><b>Willard Sterne Randall</b> is the author of <i>A Little Revenge: Benjamin Franklin and His Son, Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor, Thomas Jefferson: A Life, <em>George Washington, A Life, Alexander Hamilton, A Life </em>and<em> Ethan Allen: His Life and Times.</em></i><em> Randall is a retired&nbsp;professor of history at Champlain College,&nbsp;holds as permanent appointment as&nbsp;Visiting Professor&nbsp;of History at John Cabot University in Rome.

He was a creature who would prove in many ways to be more human than I am.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;from The Good Good Pig<br><br>A naturalist who spent months at a time living on her own among wild creatures in remote jungles, Sy Montgomery had always felt more comfortable with animals than with people. So she gladly opened her heart to a sick piglet who had been crowded away from nourishing meals by his stronger siblings. Yet Sy had no inkling that this piglet, later named Christopher Hogwood, would not only survive but flourish&#x2013;and she soon found herself engaged with her small-town community in ways she had never dreamed possible. Unexpectedly, Christopher provided this peripatetic traveler with something she had sought all her life: an anchor (eventually weighing 750 pounds) to family and home.<br><br>The Good Good Pig celebrates Christopher Hogwood in all his glory, from his inauspicious infancy to hog heaven in rural New Hampshire, where his boundless zest for life and his large, loving heart made him absolute monarch over a (mostly) peaceable kingdom. At first, his domain included only Sy&#x2019;s cosseted hens and her beautiful border collie, Tess. Then the neighbors began fetching Christopher home from his unauthorized jaunts, the little girls next door started giving him warm, soapy baths, and the villagers brought him delicious leftovers. His intelligence and fame increased along with his girth. He was featured in USA Today and on several National Public Radio environmental programs. On election day, some voters even wrote in Christopher&#x2019;s name on their ballots.<br><br>But as this enchanting book describes, Christopher Hogwood&#x2019;s influence extended far beyond celebrity; for he was, as a friend said, a great big Buddha master. Sy reveals what she and others learned from this generous soul who just so happened to be a pig&#x2013;lessons about self-acceptance, the meaning of family, the value of community, and the pleasures of the sweet green Earth. The Good Good Pig provides proof that with love, almost anything is possible.</p><p>Sy Montgomery is a naturalist, author, documentary scriptwriter, and radio commentator who writes for children as well as adults. Among her award-winning books are Journey of the Pink Dolphins, Spell of the Tiger, and Search for the Golden Moon Bear. She has made four trips to Peru and Brazil to study the pink dolphins of the Amazon; and on other expeditions, she was chased by an angry silverback gorilla in Zaire; bitten by a vampire bat in Costa Rica; undressed by an orangutan in Borneo; and hunted by a tiger in India. She also worked in a pit crawling with eighteen thousand snakes in Manitoba; handled a wild tarantula in French Guiana; and swam with piranhas, electric eels, and dolphins in the Amazon. She lives in New Hampshire.Chapter 1<br><br> Runthood<br><br> Christopher Hogwood came home on my lap in a shoe box.<br><br> On a rain-drenched April evening, so cold the frogs were silent, so gray we could hardly see our barn, my husband drove our rusting Subaru over mud roads sodden with melted snow. Pig manure caked on our boots. The smell of a sick animal hung heavy in our clothes.<br><br> It did not seem an auspicious time to make the life- changing choice of adopting a pig.<br><br> That whole spring, in fact, had been terrible. My father, an Army general, a hero I so adored that I had confessed in Sunday school that I loved him more than Jesus, was dying painfully, gruesomely of lung cancer. He had survived the Bataan Death March. He had survived three years of Japanese prison camps. In the last months of my father&#x2019;s life, my glamorous, slender mother&#x2014;still as crazy about him as the day they&#x2019;d met forty years before&#x2014;resisted getting a chairlift, a wheelchair, a hospice nurse. She believed he could survive anything. But he could not survive this.<br><br> The only child, I had flown back and forth from New Hampshire to Virginia to be with my parents whenever I could. I would return to New Hampshire from these wrenching trips to try to finish my first book, a tribute to my heroines, primatologists Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birute Galdikas. The research had been challenging: I had been charged by an angry silverback gorilla in Zaire, stood up by Jane Goodall in Tanzania, undressed by an orangutan in Borneo, and accosted for money by a gun-toting guard ten thousand feet up the side of a volcano in Rwanda. Now I was on a tight deadline, and the words wouldn&#x2019;t come.<br><br> My husband, who writes on American history and preservation, was in the heat of writing his second book. In the Memory House is about time and change in New England, set largely in our corner of the world. But it looked like it might not stay ours for long. For the past three years, ever since our marriage, we had lived, first as renters and then as caretakers, in an idyllic, 110-year-old white clapboard farmhouse on eight acres in southern New Hampshire, near mountains that Thoreau had climbed. Ours was the newest house in our small neighborhood. Though our neighbors owned the two- hundred-year-old &#x201c;antiques&#x201d; that real estate agents praised, this place had everything I&#x2019;d ever wanted: a fenced pasture, a wooded brook, a three-level barn, and forty-year-old lilacs framing the front door. But it was about to be sold out from under us. Our landlords, writer-artist friends our age whose parents had bankrolled the house, had moved to Paris and didn&#x2019;t plan to come back. We were desperate to buy the place. But because we were both freelance writers, our income was deemed too erratic to merit the mortgage.<br><br> It seemed I was about to lose my father, my book, and my home.<br><br> But for Christopher Hogwood, the spring had been more terrible yet.<br> He had been born in mid-February, on a farm owned by George and Mary Iselin, about a thirty-five-minute drive from our house. We knew George and Mary by way of my best friend, Gretchen Vogel. Gretchen knew we had a lot in common. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll love them,&#x201d; Gretchen had assured me. &#x201c;They have pigs!&#x201d;<br><br> In fact, George had been raising pigs longer than Mary had known him. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re a farmer or a hippie,&#x201d; George had reasoned, &#x201c;you can make money raising pigs.&#x201d; George and Mary were quintessential hippie farmers: born, as we were, in the 1950s, they lived the ideals of the late &#x2019;60s and early &#x2019;70s&#x2014;peace, joy, and love&#x2014;and, both blessed with radiant blue eyes, blond hair, and good looks, always looked like they had just woken up refreshed from sleeping in a pile of leaves somewhere, perhaps with elves in attendance. They were dedicated back-to-the-landers who lived out of their garden and made their own mayonnaise out of eggs from their free-range hens. They were idealistic, but resourceful, too: it did not escape them that there are vast quantities of free pig food out there, from bakeries, school cafeterias, grocery stores, and factory outlets. George and Mary would get a call to come pick up forty pounds of potato chips or a truckload of Twinkies. To their dismay, they discovered their kids, raised on homemade, organic meals, would sometimes sneak down to the barn at 4 a.m. and eat the junk food they got for the pigs. (&#x201c;We found out because in the morning we&#x2019;d find these chocolate rings around their mouths,&#x201d; Mary told me.)<br><br> On their shaggy, overgrown 165 acres, they cut their own firewood, hayed the fields, and raised not only pigs but draft horses, rabbits, ducks, chickens, goats, sheep, and children. But the pigs, I suspect, were George&#x2019;s favorites. And they were mine, too.<br><br> We visited them every spring. We didn&#x2019;t get to see George and Mary often&#x2014;our schedules and lives were so different&#x2014;but the baby pigs ensured we never lost touch. The last time we&#x2019;d visited was the previous March, at the close of sugaring season, when George was out boiling sap from their sugar maples. March in New Hampshire is the dawn of mud season, and the place looked particularly disheveled. Rusting farm machinery sat stalled, in various states of repair and disrepair, among the mud and wire fencing and melting snow. Colorful, fraying laundry was strung across the front porch like Tibetan prayer flags. Inside the house, an old cottage in desperate need of paint, the floors were coming up and the ceilings were coming down. Late that morning, in a kitchen steamy from the kettle boiling on the woodstove, we found a seemingly uncountable number of small children in flannel pajamas&#x2014;their three kids plus a number of cousins and visiting friends&#x2014;sprawled across plates of unfinished pancakes or crawling stickily across the floor. The sink was piled with dirty dishes. As Mary reached for a mug from the pile, she mentioned everyone was just getting over the flu. Would we like a cup of tea?<br><br> No thanks, Howard and I answered hastily&#x2014;but we would like to see the pigs again.<br><br> The barn was not Norman Rockwell. It was more like Norman Rockwell meets Edward Hopper. The siding was ancient, the sills rotting, the interior cavernous and furry with cobwebs. We loved it. We would peer over the tall stall doors, our eyes adjusting to the gloom, and find the stalls with piglets in residence. Once we had located a family, we would climb in and play with them.<br><br> On some farms, this would be a dangerous proposition. Sows can weigh over five hundred pounds and can snap if they feel their piglets are threatened. The massive jaws can effortlessly crush a peach pit&#x2014;or a kneecap. The razor-sharp canines strop each other. And for good reason: In the wild, pigs need to be strong and brave. In his hunting days in Brazil, President Theodore Roosevelt once saw a jaguar dismembered by South American native pigs. Although pigs are generally good-natured, more people are killed each year by pigs than by sharks. (Which should be no surprise&#x2014;how often do you get to see a shark?) Pigs raised on crowded factory farms, tortured into insanity, have been known to eat anything that falls into the pigpen, including the occasional child whose parents are foolish enough to let their kid wander into such a place unsupervised. Feral pigs (of which there are more than four million running around in the United States alone) can kill adult humans if they are threatened. That pigs occasionally eat people has always struck me as only fair, considering the far vaster number of pigs eaten by humans.<br><br> But George&#x2019;s sows were all sweethearts. When we entered a stall, the sow, lying on her side to facilitate nursing, would usually raise her giant, 150-pound head, cast us a benign glance from one intelligent, lash-fringed eye, flex her wondrous and wet nose disk to capture our scent, and utter a grunt of greeting. The piglets were adorable miniatures of their behemoth parents&#x2014;some pink, some black, some red, some spotted, and some with handsome racing stripes, like baby wild boars, looking like very large chipmunks. At first the piglets seemed unsure whether they should try to eat us or run away. They would rush at us in a herd, squealing, then race back on tiny, high-heeled hooves to their giant, supine mother for another tug on her milky teats. And then they would charge forth again, growing bold enough to chew on shoes or untie laces. Many of the folks who bought a pig from George would later make a point of telling him what a great pig it was. Even though the babies were almost all destined for the freezer, the folks who bought them seldom mentioned what these pigs tasted like as hams or chops or sausage. No, the people would always comment that George&#x2019;s were particularly nice pigs.<br><br> The year Chris was born was a record one for piglets. Because we were beset and frantic, we didn&#x2019;t visit the barn that February or March. But that year, unknown to us, George and Mary had twenty sows&#x2014;more than ever before&#x2014;and almost all of them had record litters.<br><br> &#x201c;Usually a sow doesn&#x2019;t want to raise more than ten piglets,&#x201d; Mary explained to me. &#x201c;Usually a sow has ten good working teats.&#x201d; (They actually have twelve, but only ten are usually in working order.) When a sow has more than ten piglets, somebody is going to lose out&#x2014;and that somebody is the runt.<br><br> A runt is distinguished not only by its small size and helpless predicament. Unless pulled from the litter and nursed by people, a runt is usually doomed, for it is a threat to the entire pig family. &#x201c;A runt will make this awful sound&#x2014;Nynh! Nynh! Nynh!&#x201d; Mary told me. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just awful. It would attract predators.

She lay at the edge of the hazel coppice, one cheek pressed to the moss that smelt of worm cast and the last of the sun, listening: to the wind in the elms, rushing away from the day, to the jackdaws changing their calls from &#x201c;Outward! Outward!&#x201d; to &#x201c;Home now! Home!,&#x201d; to the rustle of the last frightened shrews scuttling under the layers of leaf fall before the owls began their hunt. From far away came the indignant honking of geese as the goosegirl herded them back inside the wattle fence, and the child knew, in the wordless way that three-year-olds reckon time, that soon Onnen would come and find her and Cian and hurry them back. <br>Onnen, some leftwise cousin of Ceredig king, always hurried, but the child, Hild, did not. She liked the rhythm of her days: time alone (Cian didn&#x2019;t count) and time by the fire listening to the murmur of British and Anglisc and even Irish. She liked time at the edges of things&#x2014;the edge of the crowd, the edge of the pool, the edge of the wood&#x2014;where all must pass but none quite belonged. <br>The jackdaw cries faded. The geese quieted. The wind cooled. She sat up. <br>&#x201c;Cian?&#x201d; <br>Cian, sitting cross-legged as a seven-year-old could and Hild as yet could not, looked up from the hazel switch he was stripping. <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Onnen?&#x201d; <br>He swished his stick. &#x201c;I shall hit a tree, as the Gododdin once swung at the wicked Bryneich.&#x201d; But the elms&#x2019; sough and sigh was becoming a low roar in the rush of early evening, and she didn&#x2019;t care about wicked war bands, defeated in the long ago by her Anglisc forefathers. <br>&#x201c;I want Onnen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be along. Or perhaps I shall be the hero Morei, firing the furze, dying with red light flaring on the enamel of my armour, the rim of my shield.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I want Hereswith!&#x201d; If she couldn&#x2019;t have Onnen, she would have her sister. <br>&#x201c;I could make a sword for you, too. You shall be Branwen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a sword. I want Onnen. I want Hereswith.&#x201d; <br>He sighed and stood. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go now. If you&#x2019;re frightened.&#x201d; <br>She frowned. She wasn&#x2019;t frightened. She was three; she had her own shoes. Then she heard firm, tidy footsteps on the woodcutters&#x2019; path, and she laughed. &#x201c;Onnen!&#x201d; <br>But even as Cian&#x2019;s mother came into view, Hild frowned again. Onnen was not hurrying. Indeed, Onnen took a moment to smooth her hair, and at that Hild and Cian stepped close together. <br>Onnen stopped before Hild. <br>&#x201c;Your father is dead.&#x201d; <br>Hild looked at Cian. He would know what this meant. <br>&#x201c;The prince is dead?&#x201d; he said. <br>Onnen looked from one to the other. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll not be wanting to call him prince now.&#x201d; <br>Far away a settling jackdaw cawed once. <br>&#x201c;Da is prince! He is!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He was.&#x201d; With a strong thumb, Onnen wiped a smear of dirt from Hild&#x2019;s cheekbone. &#x201c;Little prickle, the lord Hereric was our prince, indeed. But he&#x2019;ll not be back. And your troubles are just begun.&#x201d; <br>Troubles. Hild knew of troubles from songs. <br>&#x201c;We go to your lady mother&#x2014;keep a quiet mouth and a bright mind, I know you&#x2019;re able. And Cian, bide by me. The highfolk won&#x2019;t need us in their business just now.&#x201d; <br>Cian swished at an imaginary foe. &#x201c;Highfolk,&#x201d; he said, in the same tone he said <i>Feed the pigs!</i> when Onnen told him to, but he also rubbed the furrow under his nose with his knuckle, as he did when he was trying not to cry. <br>Hild put her arms around him. They didn&#x2019;t quite meet, but she squeezed as hard as she could. Trouble meant they had to listen, not fight. <br>And then they were wrapped about by Onnen&#x2019;s arms, Onnen&#x2019;s cloak, Onnen&#x2019;s smell, wool and woman and toasted malt, and Hild knew she&#x2019;d been brewing beer, and the afternoon was almost ordinary again. <br>&#x201c;Us,&#x201d; Cian said, and hugged Hild hard. &#x201c;We are us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We are us,&#x201d; Hild repeated, though she wasn&#x2019;t sure what he meant. <br>Cian nodded. He kept a protective arm around Hild but looked at his mother. &#x201c;Was it a wound?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It was not, but the rest we&#x2019;ll chew on later, as we may. For now we get the bairn to her mam and stay away from the hall.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Caer Loid, at the heart of Elmet, wasn&#x2019;t much of a hall. Hild knew this because when they&#x2019;d first arrived in the rain months ago, her mother had sniffed her sniff-that-was-a-sigh. Breguswith had done that often in their exile among the kingdoms of the wealh, always as a prelude to driving Onnen and her other women to organise the temporary stop into a reflection of home while she set out her cases of whorls and spindles and tucked her distaff in her belt. At these times, Hild and Hereswith must creep like mice, and the score of sworn warrior gesiths who remained would get more magnificent baldrics for their swords, gold thread in the tablet weave at cuff and hem, even embroidered work along the sleeves. They must look proud and bright and well provided for, that all would know who they were, where they came from, and to where they might still ascend in service of the lady Breguswith and Hereric, her lord, should-be king of Deira. <br>Hild recalled no sights or sounds of Deira, the standard against which all was compared, the long-left home. She had vague memories of sun on plums, others of a high place of lowing cattle and bitter wind, of ships and wagons and the crook of her father&#x2019;s arm as he rode, but she knew none of them were home, could be home. �thelfrith Iding, Anglisc king of Bernicia, had driven them out before she and her sister were born. She recognised people who might be from that long-lost home when they galloped in on foundering horses or slipped through the enclosure fence during the dark of the moon. She knew them by their thick woven cloaks, their hanging hair and beards, and their Anglisc voices: words drumming like apples spilt over wooden boards, round, rich, stirring. Like her father&#x2019;s words, and her mother&#x2019;s, and her sister&#x2019;s. Utterly unlike Onnen&#x2019;s otter-swift British or the dark liquid gleam of Irish. Hild spoke each to each. Apples to apples, otter to otter, gleam to gleam, though only when her mother wasn&#x2019;t there. Never stoop to wealh speech, her mother said, not even British, not even with Onnen. Never trust wealh, especially those shaved priestly spies. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>From the byre came the rolling whicker-whinny of horses getting to know each other. At least two new voices. Hild clutched harder at Onnen&#x2019;s hand and Onnen shook her slightly: <i>Quiet mouth, bright mind!</i> <br>The riders, two men, were with Ceredig king and the lady Breguswith in the hall. The room was smoky and hot, like all British dwellings&#x2014;the peat in the great central pit was burning high, though it was not yet cold outside&#x2014;but still the smell of travel, of horse, was clearly on the men, and their bright, checked cloaks were much muddied at hem and seat. Breguswith, distaff tucked under her left arm, rolling her fine-yarn spindle down her thigh with her right, stared absently at the fire, though Hild knew even as her mother&#x2019;s fingers were busy, busy, busy teasing out the yarn, testing its tension, her attention was focused on Ceredig king, who laughed and leaned from his stool and let firelight wink on the thick torc around his neck. <br>Onnen pushed Hild forward. The visitors, both slight, with magnificent moustaches and the air of brothers, turned. <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said the taller one in British. Strange British, from the west. &#x201c;You have your father&#x2019;s hair.&#x201d; <br>Yffing chestnut, her mother called it. <i>And her outside one big prickliness like a chestnut, too</i>, said Onnen. <i>Or a hedgepig</i>, said her mother, and they would laugh. No one was laughing now but Ceredig, and it was his laugh-because-I-am-king laugh, the one for important visitors, to show ease in his own hall. <i>Everything a king does is a lie</i>, Onnen said. <br>And then the stranger looked beyond Hild. &#x201c;And who&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; <br>Hild twisted to look. Cian had followed her into the firelight, ready to snatch her back, as he&#x2019;d done in spring, when the ram had charged as she got too near. <br>&#x201c;He is nobody,&#x201d; said her mother, in Anglisc. &#x201c;My woman&#x2019;s boy.&#x201d; And as she turned&#x2014;with that long, careless grace that made men look, made the strangers look&#x2014;Onnen put her arm around Cian and tugged him gently back into the shadow. But this visitor was quicker than most. <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You.&#x201d; He crooked his finger, and Onnen and Cian stepped back into the light. &#x201c;Your name?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Onnen, lord.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And this is your son?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He is, lord.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And yourself, Onnen, you were born here?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed, lord. Six and twenty years since.&#x201d; She stood a little prouder. &#x201c;I am cousin to Ceredig king.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all cousins in this benighted wood,&#x201d; said the second stranger, but he was already turning away and beckoning for the first to do likewise. And Hild understood that although her mother and Onnen had told nothing but the truth, the visitors had been fed an essential lie. <br> <i>Quiet mouth, bright mind.</i> <br>&#x201c;Edwin Snakebeard will come to avenge Hereric Yffing&#x2019;s death,&#x201d; the stranger was saying to Ceredig. <br>&#x201c;Of course he&#x2019;ll come. He&#x2019;ll come from the south with R�dwald&#x2019;s war band to claim Deira and lay his rival kinsman&#x2019;s death at my door. The excuse he&#x2019;s looked for. Or made.&#x201d; <br>Onnen tried to herd Hild away, but Hild rooted herself to the floor, the way puppies turned limp and heavy when she tried to pick them up. <br>Ceredig was still talking &#x201c;&#x2026; this hall is burnt about my head, will there be a place for me with the king of Gwynedd?&#x201d; <br>The stranger shrugged: maybe yes, maybe no. <br>&#x201c;So. I&#x2019;ll fight, then. As I must. And make for Cadfan of Gwynedd an excuse, in his turn, to swarm north with fire and sword against the Anglisc. But tell you, Marro, to Cadfan king, aye and young Cadwallon, that one day he&#x2019;ll have to face this serpent, this king-killer, in the open. Tell him that.&#x201d; <br>Marro said, &#x201c;I will tell him.&#x201d; <br> <i>Gwynedd</i>, Hild thought. <i>Marro. Cadwallon.</i> <br>Her mother was looking at her. &#x201c;Hild, go with Onnen now, to your sister. Comfort Hereswith for me.&#x201d; And Hild&#x2019;s mind closed seamlessly over the names as though they&#x2019;d never been. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Hereswith was eight. She had their mother&#x2019;s hair, the colour of linden honey, and their mother&#x2019;s round, pretty face&#x2014;usually. Tonight, when Onnen pulled aside the embroidered curtain, Hereswith fell on her, weeping, babbling in a mix of Anglisc and British: What would happen now? Where would they go? Had it hurt when their father died? Would they starve? Where was their mother? <br>Seeing Hereswith weep started a tickle deep in Hild&#x2019;s chest, and then her nose ran, and then she howled as Onnen unfastened her cyrtel and tucked her next to Hereswith on the horsehair and sweet-gale mattress, promised them warm milk, and stroked her chestnut hair. Her dead, dead da&#x2019;s hair. <br>Hild shut it out, imagined she could hear nothing but the wind in the elms, blowing where it would, a soft roar under the moon. <br>She woke to Hereswith&#x2019;s slow, steady breaths beside her and her mother&#x2019;s murmur above. She kept her eyes tightly closed. <br>&#x201c;&#x2026; can&#x2019;t flee to Frankia, not with the storm season almost on us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The Hwicce might take us in,&#x201d; Onnen said. &#x201c;They took Osric. And he&#x2019;s �theling.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Only a cousin. And soon enough he&#x2019;ll be riding to Deira to show Edwin Usurper his belly and kiss his ring.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Like the whole isle.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Like the whole isle.&#x201d; A faint click as Breguswith slipped her fine-work whorl off her spindle and laid it on the ivory-inlaid casket that held her treasures. &#x201c;Ah, Onnen, Onnen. He was to be king. Not poisoned like a dog.&#x201d; And Hild knew they were talking now of her father. <br>&#x201c;We are alone in this world,&#x201d; Onnen said. <br>Faint rattle as her mother unfastened her girdle and hung it carefully on the hook driven into the wall post for that purpose. Hild imagined the hanging things one by one: the knife in its woven sheath, the seeing crystal, the needle case, the fire steel and tinderbox, the purse with chalk and thread and spare hairpin&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>She woke again when her mother said in her voice of iron, &#x201c;We will go to Edwin. He has won.&#x201d; <br>Hild felt a light touch on her hair but willed herself still and copied Hereswith&#x2019;s breath: in and out, in and out. Her mother smelt of smoke and heather beer. <br>&#x201c;As king his nieces will be valuable to him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your dream?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My dream.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s so young&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s Yffing. Needs must. She&#x2019;ll be ready. They both will. In their different ways.&#x201d; And then the touch of the hand on her hair was gone and Hild heard the faint <i>tck</i> of her mother unpinning her hair, followed by the two women moving about the room, and the <i>hff</i> of the rush light blown out. <br>Hereswith inched closer to Hild, whispered fiercely in her ear, &#x201c;That stupid dream&#x2014;the light of the world! Ha! That was when she still thought you might come out a boy!&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The next day Hild could eat nothing, waiting for this usurping uncle, this Edwin, to come. But no one came; it was a day like any other but for two things. First, when the time came to wash and then rinse all three children&#x2019;s hair, Onnen added oak gall to the rinse water for Cian&#x2019;s turn. <br>&#x201c;You rinse mine with vinegar,&#x201d; Hild said, peering at the tub of black water, talking as much to distract herself from her misery as anything else. She hated the washing and rinsing of hair. No matter how she tried, there was always water down her neck. And no matter how warm the water was at the beginning, by the time it wormed between her shoulder blades, it was cold. <br>&#x201c;And mine,&#x201d; Hereswith said. &#x201c;For the smell and the shine, you said. Why can&#x2019;t we have oak gall, too?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because it would make your pretty honey hair dark.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Daddy called me honey. But not Hild. She doesn&#x2019;t have honey hair.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What makes your hair and Hild&#x2019;s hair shine, and what makes Cian&#x2019;s shine is different. His hair is different.&#x201d; <br>But it wasn&#x2019;t, Hild thought, it wasn&#x2019;t. Her hair and Cian&#x2019;s were even the same colour. Or had been, before the oak gall. <br>And then, while they were shivering like wet rats, Inis, the king&#x2019;s man, came by. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wanted,&#x201d; he said to Onnen. &#x201c;You and the boy both.&#x201d; <br>Onnen took all three of them, because wet unhappy children had a tendency to quarrel when unminded. <br>The middle fire in hall was burning bright, and Ceredig king wore his ceremonial wolfskin cloak and most splendid torc, though there was no one else there but two housefolk standing by the wall. <br>Onnen and the three children paused just inside the doorway. <br>&#x201c;Come,&#x201d; the king said, and Onnen gathered Cian under one arm and Hereswith under the other, and approached. Hild walked alongside Cian, her hand in his belt, as she&#x2019;d been taught. She was nervous because Onnen was nervous, but also curious. <br>&#x201c;So, cousin, you&#x2019;ve done a fine job by these young ones these years. But a boy needs a father.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know his father. I was prettier then, and not minded to keep track. As you yourself know. Cousin.&#x201d; <br>He smiled and turned away momentarily to bend and lift something from beneath his bench. Hild couldn&#x2019;t see what it was but Cian obviously could: the damp tunic stretched between his shoulder blades quivered as his heart began to hammer. <br>The king held out a small oak sword with a finely carved painted hilt and a little wicker shield. &#x201c;Well, come here, boy.&#x201d; <br>Onnen let go of him, as did Hild, who thought he might topple where he stood, but after a moment he managed to walk to the king. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a year yet from weapons training, but who knows where we&#x2019;ll all be a year from today. A boy needs a sword, and you...</p><h2>Reader&#39;s Digest Treasury of Best Loved Songs: 114 All Time Family Favorites</h2><p>Reader&#39;s Digest Treasury of Best Loved Songs 114 All-Time Family Favorites Piano, Vocal, Guitar Hardcover wire spiral bound book 288 pages in very good condition a few songs on the contents page have a mark next to them, the only marks in the book all the interior pages are clean See my other listings for much more!

This majestic new biography of James Madison explores the astonishing story of a man of vaunted modesty who audaciously changed the world. Among the Founding Fathers, Madison was a true genius of the early republic.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outwardly reserved, Madison was the intellectual driving force behind the Constitution and crucial to its ratification. His visionary political philosophy and rationale for the union of states&#x2014;so eloquently presented in The Federalist papers&#x2014;helped shape the country Americans live in today.<br> &nbsp;<br> Along with Thomas Jefferson, Madison would found the first political party in the country&#x2019;s history&#x2014;the Democratic Republicans. As Jefferson&#x2019;s secretary of state, he managed the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the size of the United States. As president, Madison led the country in its first war under the Constitution, the War of 1812. Without precedent to guide him, he would demonstrate that a republic could defend its honor and independence&#x2014;and remain a republic still.</p><p><b>Lynne Cheney</b> is the author or coauthor of twelve books, including six bestselling books about American history for children.

Had he passed this way earlier in the day, shoppers would have slowed his pace, drawn by the covered market that stretched for blocks down the center of the street. Now, with the afternoon wearing on and a thunderstorm over the city, only a few bargain hunters remained. Farmers who had brought produce in from the Pennsylvania countryside were scrambling into their wagons for what promised to be a muddy trek home.1</p><p>Visitors to Philadelphia found the market a wonder, but the residents of Market Street were not fond of it. They repeatedly&#x2014;and futilely&#x2014;tried to halt its expansion, arguing that the crowds did real estate values no good. Better to have the more peaceful setting enjoyed by residents farther west, the direction that the hurrying figure was headed. He crossed Fifth Street, its wet cobblestones glistening underfoot, then with springing step went up the stairs and entered the door of the ample brick building on the corner. It was the comfortable residence of Mary House, an elderly widow who lived there with her son, Samuel, her daughter, Eliza Trist, and Mrs. Trist&#x2019;s son, Hore Browse. It was also one of Philadelphia&#x2019;s most highly regarded boardinghouses, a home away from home for many of America&#x2019;s political notables.2</p><p>Thirty-six-year-old James Madison, shaking off rain inside the front door, was one of Mrs. House&#x2019;s regulars. He had begun staying with her in 1780, when he first became a member of the Continental Congress, and now, after a day-and-a-half ride by stagecoach from New York, he was at her lodgings again, this time to attend a convention scheduled for the second Monday in May. Over the past seven years, Madison had spent more time at Mrs. House&#x2019;s than at his Virginia home, and he had come to regard her family as his family. He was particularly fond of Mrs. Trist, a woman of spirit and wit. In 1784 she had traveled by flatboat down the Mississippi to Louisiana to be with her husband, Nicholas, a former British officer. She recorded flora and fauna along the way for Thomas Jefferson, another Virginian who stayed at the Market Street lodgings, unaware as she was taking notes that she had become a widow. Between the last letter she received from Nicholas and the beginning of her trip downriver, he had died. Jefferson and Madison, learning of Nicholas&#x2019;s fate, wrote to each other of their concern for Mrs. Trist. With the Spanish having closed the Mississippi to American navigation, how would she get back to Philadelphia? But she found a way, sailing first to Jamaica and from there back home.3</p><p>At no more than five feet six inches tall, Madison was not physically imposing in the way Jefferson was, or the great Washington, whom Mrs. Trist and her mother were expecting to arrive in little over a week. But he was fit and well proportioned, and as he gazed out at the world from deep-set light blue eyes, he had a presence about him, &#x201c;a habit of self-possession,&#x201d; Jefferson called it, &#x201c;which placed at ready command the rich resources of his luminous and discriminating mind.&#x201d;4</p><p>Madison did not leap forward to meet strangers or try to dominate in conversation. He was naturally reserved and perhaps also influenced by a lesson of his youth. From the <i>Spectator,</i> a London periodical that he favored in his early years, he had learned that modesty becomes a man. Famed <i>Spectator</i> author Joseph Addison described it as &#x201c;a guard to virtue&#x201d; and noted that it &#x201c;sets off every great talent which a man can be possessed of.&#x201d;5</p><p>By now Madison also understood that reticence had its political uses. It was wise to avoid strong statements while circumstances were still unfolding. It was often advantageous to put forth proposals anonymously and thus avoid alienating allies who might not agree. If in avoiding center stage Madison missed some of the praise, he also avoided some of the criticism, thus saving his reputation for a future day.</p><p>Madison dressed plainly, as befitted a man who did not want to be conspicuous. Eventually, he would wear only black. His public speaking was as unadorned as his dress. His words and ideas came forth with coolness and clarity, unobscured by drama. Although no one thought of him as an orator for the ages, those who paid attention understood that when he spoke he was enormously effective. &#x201c;If [eloquence] includes persuasion by convincing,&#x201d; his fellow Virginian John Marshall wrote, &#x201c;Mr. Madison was the most eloquent man I ever heard.&#x201d;6</p><p>Thomas Jefferson believed that Madison&#x2019;s reserve had held him back when he first began his public career, and another friend, Samuel Stanhope Smith, told him that his early achievements had come &#x201c;in spite of all your modesty.&#x201d; But the reputation that Madison had acquired by the time he arrived in Philadelphia in May 1787 suggests that his manner had been little hindrance. &#x201c;Every person seems to acknowledge his greatness,&#x201d; commented William Pierce, who, like Madison, was a delegate to the Philadelphia convention. Indeed, now that Madison&#x2019;s intellect and political skill were so widely recognized, his demeanor seemed to burnish his reputation. Despite all his renown, he remained, in Pierce&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;a gentleman of great modesty, with a remarkable sweet temper.&#x201d;7</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>ALTHOUGH SHE WAS the same age as Congressman Madison, Eliza Trist sometimes assumed a motherly attitude toward him. She knew from Jefferson that much as he had accomplished, he was likely to achieve still more, and she worried about the &#x201c;torrent of abuse&#x201d; he would have to bear as he rose higher. &#x201c;He has a soul replete with gentleness, humanity, and every social virtue,&#x201d; she wrote to Jefferson, &#x201c;and yet I am certain that some wretch or other will write against him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It will hurt his feelings and injure his health, take my word.&#x201d; Mrs. Trist almost certainly knew that in addition to the common ailments of the day&#x2014;dysentery, fevers, influenza&#x2014;Madison suffered from &#x201c;sudden attacks&#x201d; that he described as &#x201c;somewhat resembling epilepsy, and suspending the intellectual functions.&#x201d; Historians of a later time would dismiss these attacks. &#x201c;Epileptoid hysteria,&#x201d; his most influential biographer would call them.8 But Madison&#x2019;s description fits today&#x2019;s understanding of epilepsy. His sudden attacks might well have been complex partial seizures, which leave the affected person conscious but with his or her comprehension and ability to communicate impaired&#x2014;the &#x201c;intellectual functions&#x201d; suspended, one might reasonably say. In Madison&#x2019;s day such attacks were not generally regarded as epileptic, which may account for the qualifiers in his description. &#x201c;Epilepsy&#x201d; was a term reserved for convulsive seizures. But Madison saw a relationship between his attacks and those in which people fell to the ground and convulsed, an understanding that put him in advance of his time.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>MADISON DID NOT MAKE a show of himself, but neither did he lack vanity. His jacket and breeches were finely made, his stockings usually silk. He powdered his hair and combed it forward to a point in order to cover a receding hairline.9 And unassuming though he might seem, he did not hesitate to take on enormous projects. Standing in Mrs. House&#x2019;s parlor, his clothes still damp from the rain, he had a scheme in mind about as grand as could be imagined. He intended to use the upcoming convention to create a nation out of the thirteen individual states that four years before had thrown off the rule of Great Britain&#x2014;and not just any nation, but one such as never had been seen before.</p><p>He envisioned a vast republic where the people were sovereign and their fundamental rights respected as nowhere else on earth. Such a republic had been judged impossible by influential thinkers of the age. Without monarchical power at the center, they believed, a country of great size would come apart, riven by different interests and ambitions. Only in a small republic, where citizens held views and virtues in common, could there be stability. Madison perceived that this idea was based on a fiction. No society, not even the smallest, was truly homogeneous. Factions, or interest groups, were endemic to the human race, and the challenge was making sure that majority rule, which was at the heart of republican government, did not become an instrument for one faction to suppress others. The way to do this was to make the republic large enough so that no single interest dominated. &#x201c;Extend the sphere,&#x201d; Madison would soon explain, &#x201c;and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens.&#x201d;10</p><p>This insight&#x2014;brilliant and prophetic&#x2014;not only provided a rationale for the union of states that would be created by the Constitution; it would transform political thought, taking self-government from an impossible realm, in which all citizens virtuously suppressed their self-interest in the name of the common good, and moving it into reality, where interests competed with and checked one another.11 A republic was no longer a distant ideal but something to which people around the world could aspire. Bringing the idea of the extended republic to bear at a time when a great nation was to be built was Madison&#x2019;s first grand act of creative genius&#x2014;but by no means his last. Over the next five years, he, more than any other individual, would be responsible for creating the United States of America in the form we know it today.</p><p>Madison&#x2019;s time of extraordinary accomplishment came after years of intense focus, deep concentration, and nearly obsessive effort, behavior that describes most lives of genius, from Sir Isaac Newton&#x2019;s to Mozart&#x2019;s to Einstein&#x2019;s.12 Some who have achieved greatly have had families that encouraged their passions, and Madison was among these fortunate. His father had sent him to fine schools. He had for years freed him from the necessity of earning a living, thus giving him time to study and practice the art of politics. Madison was also lucky to live in an era that demanded the skills he honed while at the same time inspiring the intensity with which he honed them. For a young man drawn to the subject of power and the possibilities of nation building, it is hard to imagine a more thrilling time to come of age than in the years leading up to the American Revolution.</p><p>He brought to the cause a fervent commitment to religious freedom, perhaps because he had experienced the misery of being told what he had to believe. In the eighteenth century, people suffering from epilepsy&#x2014;or sudden attacks resembling it&#x2014;had a double burden, the disorder itself and the religious view, widely held and fiercely defended, that sufferers were unclean, sinful, even possessed by demons. In his young manhood, when the attacks began, Madison had gone through a period of deep despondency, certain that he would die and worried about his soul. He eventually emerged from the gloom, and when he did, he was on fire with the idea that no one should have to accept ideas that seemed wrong to him. A man&#x2019;s conscience was his own, not the property of church or state.</p><p>He acted on this commitment when he was just twenty-two and saw Anglicans in his native Virginia misusing the authority of the state to persecute Baptists. He not only championed the Baptists&#x2019; cause with a passion that broke through his usual reserve; he also began to explore how society could be organized to protect rights of conscience. More than a year before the Revolutionary War, he was, astonishingly, inquiring into ways &#x201c;the constitution of [a] country&#x201d; could foster freedom of belief.13 Even in his maiden venture into politics, he had a significant contribution to make, insisting that the new state of Virginia not merely tolerate religious differences but view each individual&#x2019;s conviction as a fundamental right.</p><p>Madison plunged into politics again and again. While serving in the Continental Congress, he became so immersed that he did not return home for nearly four years. Most recently he had been a member of the Virginia legislature, where he had seen to the passage of a law that Thomas Jefferson had written, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. The enacting clauses of this legislation, he exulted to Jefferson, had &#x201c;extinguished forever the ambitious hope of making laws for the human mind.&#x201d; He had also been delving deep into history, poring over hundreds of volumes that Jefferson sent him from Paris, a &#x201c;literary cargo&#x201d; concerning laws and constitutions.14 He was determined to find out how past unions of states had fared and, combining history with his own experience, to understand why the United States, under its current governing document, the Articles of Confederation, was failing to live up to its abundant promise.</p><p>By the time of the Philadelphia convention, Madison was the political equivalent of Mozart in the late 1770s, who after years of writing music was about to create his greatest works. He was Einstein, who after years of studying with &#x201c;holy zeal&#x201d; was on the verge of his <i>annus mirabilis,</i> the miracle year of 1905, in which he would establish the basis of the theory of relativity and quantum physics. As Madison climbed the narrow stairs in Mrs. House&#x2019;s boardinghouse and headed for his room, he was more knowledgeable and better practiced in the theories and realities of representative government than anyone in the country or even the world. And he was about to do what geniuses do: change forever the way people think.15</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>AT HIS DESK in the waning light of that rainy afternoon, Madison wrote a hurried letter to William Irvine, a Pennsylvanian who was one of his allies, and then he almost certainly turned his thoughts to the upcoming gathering. He had spent months working to ensure the convention&#x2019;s success: penning legislation to throw Virginia&#x2019;s support behind it, persuading Washington to attend, taking steps to see that the Confederation Congress didn&#x2019;t hinder its proceedings. Now he worked on the convention&#x2019;s agenda, not because anyone had asked him to, but because he understood that the surest path to the governmental framework he envisioned lay in providing the program that would guide discussion. He also knew that having others of influence lined up behind his plan would give it greater force. One of his chief reasons for arriving early in Philadelphia&#x2014;he was the first out-of-state delegate there&#x2014;was the chance it gave him to meet with others as they arrived and convince them of the benefits of his proposal.</p><p>At the convention, he would be one of the chief participants in debate while at the same time keeping notes that would create a historical record of immeasurable worth. The Constitution that the delegates finally agreed upon would not be everything he had wanted, but he quickly concluded it was more than anyone could have hoped, and with John Jay and Alexander Hamilton he defended it in <i>The Federalist,</i> a series of essays that has become a classic of political thought. Madison would be crucial to securing the ratification of the Constitution in Virginia, the biggest and most powerful state, and he would f...</p></p><h2>The Seabird&#39;s Cry: The Lives and Loves of the Planet&#39;s Great Ocean Voyagers</h2><p><p><b>Life itself could never have been sustainable without seabirds.

He lives in Portland.<i> The Agony and the Methodology</i><br><br> The pain of writing is legend. And its intensity hardly varies between the student facing a term-paper deadline, the office worker thrashing out a report, and the seasoned professional writing for publication.<br><br> When I run a writing seminar, I usually hand out a questionnaire that, among other things, quizzes the participants about the emotion they bring to their writing. They like to quote Dorothy Parker, the New York literary wit who said she hated writing, but loved having written. "It's agony and ecstasy," one writer said. "When I get the idea, and when I'm finished . . . it's joyful. Everything in between is agony."<br><br> Why should that be? Physically, writing's relatively easy work. Take it from a guy who's loaded log ships, pumped gas, and tarred roofs in the midsummer sun. Writers work on their butts and out of the weather. So what's with all this whining?<br><br> And why the avoidance, which one writer labeled "tap dancing"? "I'll dance around the story," he said, "putting it off because I think it's harder than it invariably is."<br><br> What's the first thing you do when facing a new writing assignment? I ask. "Get a cup of coffee," a journalist replied. "More difficult story, more coffee, more trips to the bathroom, more procrastination."<br><br> "But is it really procrastination," another writer asked, "when I'm walking around, getting another cup of coffee, and thinking about the story? More likely, it's a paralysis from possibilities: possible stories, possible leads, possible story flow."<br><br> Exactly! Paralysis from possibilities. The tendency to see the task ahead as overwhelming explains most keyboard anxiety. For a variety of reasons, we view writing from the back end. Day in and day out, we witness the finished work of accomplished writers. In our mind's eye we stroll down street after street of beautiful homes, ignorant of the piece-by-piece construction that created them, one two-by-four at a time. "Look at that gorgeous building," we think. "The craftsmanship. The detail work. The sheer size of the thing! I could never build something like that."<br><br> Time for another cup of coffee.<br><br> But there's another way to look at it. For the past year I've watched four row houses rise on the lot next door. The work was noisy, messy, and distracting, but instructive, too. From the logging crew that brought in chain saws and cleared the lot to the roofers who nailed on the shingles, not one bit of work went into those houses that you or I couldn't do ourselves, given enough time and some research into the technical details. The secret is in the process, not the finished buildings.<br><br> The pain of writing stems from comparing your blank screen with the finished pages you see all around you. But beautiful writing is built one step at a time, just like a house. Take the steps slowly, break them down into pieces small enough to handle easily, and the agony will disappear.<br><br> Writing, it is often said, is thinking. And the most productive form of thinking, the method that built the modern world, is science. The discipline, the logic, and the procedural rules of science took us from oxcarts to interstellar probes. So it's not surprising that scientists place so much emphasis on process. Science, they will insist, is process. Articles in scientific journals invariably include detailed descriptions of how the authors conducted their research--the methodology. That mandatory section of the report sometimes takes more space than the section describing results.<br><br> Methodology is just as important for writers. "Genius," said F. Scott Fitzgerald, "is the ability to put into effect what is in your mind." In writing, that can involve a considerable journey. And, as every mother's cliche will have it, the longest journey begins with a single step.<br><br><i> The Back-End View of Writing<br></i><br> For decades, I focused my writing-improvement efforts on the last stages of the writing process, the eleventh-hour nit-picking that burnishes words to a high gloss. That's what I spent my time doing in the newsroom. And those were the skills I taught in my magazine columns and workshops.<br><br> I wasn't alone. Most writing coaches, copy editors, workshop organizers, newspaper line editors, readers, and critics have focused on the polish stage of writing.<br><br> Harvard education professors V. A. Howard and J. H. Barton, authors of a wonderful summary of writing research called Thinking on Paper, note that a principal "obstacle to writing improvement is our tendency to dwell on either the final results or the mental origins of writing to the exclusion of the activity of writing, as if an empty gap separated writing from thinking."<br><br> As Bob Baker, the author of Newsthinking, puts it, "You have to stop concentrating on merely the results of good writing--the examples they show you in most textbooks. You have to begin thinking about the causes--the thought strategies that created those polished examples."<br><br> Baker, a former writer and editor at the Los Angeles Times, was one of the writing-process pioneers who helped me discover new dimensions to writing and editing. Don Murray, the Pulitzer Prize-winning University of New Hampshire professor, was another. Murray's seminal book, Writing for Readers, helped shift the focus of American writing instruction from results to causes.<br><br> I've seen the power of what Murray teaches. Analyzing and improving process, making it less painful and more efficient, is the surest route to writing improvement. It's helped me with my own writing, and I'm confident it can help yours, too.<br><b><br> I. THE WRITING PROCESS</b><br><br> Seize the subject, and the words will follow.<br><br> --Cato the Elder<br><br> Writing One Step at a Time<br><br> Most of us have had a classmate who could sit down the night before the due date for a big term paper and bang it out in a couple of hours. He'd be heading out for a beer while we sat staring at our keyboards with--as journalist and screenwriter Gene Fowler described the predicament--little drops of blood forming on our foreheads.<br><br> Or maybe your experience was with a colleague who could knock out a big departmental report before lunch. Or a friend who dashed off long, beautifully organized letters in one continuous flow of words. Or a closet novelist who produced a book by turning out a few pages a day despite holding a full-time job and having two toddlers underfoot.<br><br> Maybe they're all writing gibberish. Or, like the reporters who shrug and say their stories just "write themselves," maybe they're mindlessly spewing out cliches according to a formula that requires no thought whatsoever.<br><br> Still, sometimes the two-hour term paper gets an A, the speedy report writer earns a promotion, and the relaxed reporter wins a Pulitzer.<br><br> That shouldn't be terribly surprising. Most accomplished writers follow an efficient road map that leads them through projects without a lot of angst. In the real world of experienced professionals, a published piece almost never originates at the keyboard.<br><br> Consider everything that typically leads to a final draft:<br><br> 1. The idea that results in a piece of writing may take days, weeks, or months forming in the writer's mind. It probably will be shaped by discussion with others--editors, friends, sources. Eventually, the best ideas take the form of hypotheses that can be tested in the real world.<br><br> 2. The information gathering can take anywhere from a few minutes to months. In the case of some Pulitzer Prize-winning feature stories, reporting lasted a year or more. Copywriters at ad agencies may spend months on research, interviewing, and brainstorming. Gathering string for a novel or a nonfiction book can take decades.<br><br> 3. After the reporting, the writer has to ask, "So what?" What, in other words, is the focus of all the data pulled together during information gathering?<br><br> 4. The raw material--notes, documents, database information--must be sorted and organized. That gives the report, essay, or story a shape, and it makes the raw material accessible during the writing.<br><br> 5. The writer must work through the first draft.<br><br> 6. The writer--and everybody else involved in producing the finished product--must dive into the final tweaking and polishing.<br><br> Of course, writing projects rarely conform perfectly to this idealized scheme. Ideas get refined as information gathering proceeds and the ultimate focus of the writing emerges. Drafting may suggest more meaningful approaches to organization. In the real world, writers jump around the process instead of moving smoothly from beginning to end.<br><br> Regardless of the writing project, however, one thing remains the same. Content problems are almost always process problems. And some writers struggle for their entire lives without tumbling to the First Law of Writing Improvement: A problem visible at any one stage of the writing process usually results from something that happened at the immediately preceding stage.<br><br> Why do some writers bog down in aimless morasses of information? Almost always it's because their original idea wasn't adequately developed. Why can't some writers find a focus? Probably because their undirected information gathering swamped them with irrelevant information. Why do some writers have a hard time finding a sensible organizational scheme? Maybe they have no focus. Poor organization, of course, will make it devilishly difficult to craft a decent draft. And if you have a lousy draft, you're bound to have problems ...</p><h2>The Secret World of Og</h2><p>The Canadian Classic, written by Pierre Berton and illustrated by his daughter, Patsy is now a 26 episode animated children&#x2019;s series on CBC television beginning Saturday, September 9, 2006.

What passes for paella at restaurants and even in cookbooks here is a pale imitation of the real thing, the vibrant Spanish rice dish that marries the robust flavors of olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, and pepper with short-grain rice, broth, and meat, fish, or vegetables. Penelope Casas is here to restore the glorious paella to its rightful place as a grain-based meal that will gratify the senses as well as be the centerpiece for easy, elegant entertaining.</p><p>Casas presents sixty different fascinating paellas, some traditional, some her own creation, showing how easily some of the preparation can be done ahead of time with supermarket ingredients. She includes a superior collection of tapas, the Spanish meal starters, two dozen simple desserts, and a handful of broths and sauces. Her passion for paella, her clear directions, and her creative pairings of fresh ingredients make this unusual cookbook a winner.</p></p><p><p><b>Penelope Casas</b> is the author of three well-respected books on Spanish cuisine:<i> !Delicioso! The Regional Cooking of Spain; Tapas, The Little Dishes of Spain; </i>and <i>The Foods and Wines of Spain.</i> She lives near New York City.</p>Paella! <br> A Passion for Paella <i>Valencia: Home of Paella</i> <i>Clearing Up a Few Misconceptions</i> <i>Tips for a Perfect Paella</i> <i>A Few Tricks</i> <i>Pairing Spanish Wines with Paella</i> &nbsp; <br> Paella, among the best known and most beloved dishes in the world, has been my passion ever since I first tasted it in Spain over thirty years ago. And yet I have little enthusiasm for the paellas I have eaten outside of Spain. The horrors that have befallen this exquisite dish and the indignities it has suffered! Paella transforms rice, the sustenance of at least half of the world's population, into a brilliantly complex and exceedingly baroque creation. Praise for paella comes from all quarters, and paella recipes appear in most all-purpose American cookbooks. Yet even the most respected chefs and cookbook authors have little understanding of how extraordinary paella can be when authentically prepared. They have perpetuated misconceptions that continue to deprive Americans who eat out and cook at home of the true greatness of paella. Paella is not a steamed rice, cooked in a covered pan, but generally a "dry" rice that cooks uncovered in a wide, flat paella pan. It is not bright orange (that comes from artificial coloring), and it is not a precooked pot of Uncle Ben's rice to which lobster, chicken, and clams have been strewn on top to give a pretty appearance and to disguise what is usually very ordinary rice. Garnishes, in fact, are totally secondary to paella and among their least important features. A paella should never be judged by its toppings; paellais visually striking in itself and needs little additional adornment. The texture and flavor of the rice is everything, and that flavor depends on the ingredients that are combined with the rice and from which the rice soaks up its flavors. Plain rice, after all, is like a painter's canvas waiting to be transformed into a work of art. For me, the best paella is not the typical mixture of seafood, meat, and sausage that we have come to call paella. Such paellas are frowned upon in Valencia, the area of Spain that is paella's homeland, because they do not allow each ingredient to be savored and appreciated on its own merits. The best paellas highlight special ingredients--meat, fish, or vegetables. That is why you will find only a handful of so-called mixed paellas in this book. Authentic paella is always made with short-grain rice because it absorbs flavors far more readily than long-grain converted rice (which is parboiled before you buy it) and is immensely more exciting in taste and texture. Serious cooks would not dream of using long-grain rice to make risotto, so why accept it in paella where it is equally inappropriate? The cooking methods and ingredients for paella and risotto may not be the same, but the concept of combining short-grain rice with a variety of ingredients is indeed quite similar. My mission is to rescue the glorious paella that I know and love from worldwide ignominy where it has languished for decades. The time is ripe; interest in grains and in the health-giving Mediterranean diet is at an all-time high. And the Spanish diet in particular, based on the robust flavors of olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, and peppers--all of which enter into paella--has put Spain in the enviable position as the country with the world's third highest life expectancy. Paella represents just one region of Spain, and each region is a world unto itself. Indeed, Spain compresses the variety of a continent into a country no bigger than Texas. You will find regions of soaring peaks, vast plains, deserts, and thick forests--each with its distinctive culture, a product of many ancient civilizations that passed through the Iberian Peninsula and left their mark. Cooking in Spain is equally varied: extraordinary seafood along the extensive coast; baby lamb and suckling pig, roasted in brick vaulted ovens from the plains of Castile; gazpacho and cooling vinaigrettes from the south, where a strong Moorish influence brought the scents of cumin, coriander, and nutmeg to the cooking; and, of course, paella from the eastern coast, often called the Region of the Rices. Correcting preconceived notions about paella has certainly been an uphill battle, but progress has been made. Some restaurants in America are now preparing paellas in the traditional manner, and my hope is that <i>Paella!</i> will make Americans realize what they have been missing all these years. Curiously, despite its mistreatment, paella's popularity never fades, no matter what the food fashion of the moment happens to be. <i>Valencia: Home of Paella</i> A trip to Spain for me is never complete without a visit to paella's native land, the region on Spain's eastern coast officially designated Pa�s Valenci� (Valencian Country), but commonly called El Levante (land of the rising sun, because it is here that Spain greets the day). El Levante also refers to Murcia, the region to the south that also produces and prepares rice. The Pa�s Valenci� comprises the provinces of Castell�n de la Plana, Valencia, and Alicante, and as you head south close to the Mediterranean coast, you will discover the region's special beauty: In the narrow corridor between the rugged imposing mountains to the west and the sea, the mighty rivers J�car and Turia deposit rich alluvial soil, forming pancake-flat land. In this warm, humid, sun-drenched area, everything thrives, creating what is often called the Garden of Spain. Orange trees beyond number carpet the land in the province of Castell�n de la Plana; farther south as you approach Valencia, small family plots <i>(huertas),</i> which produce the glistening fresh vegetables that are important to every paella, begin to appear. Once past the city of Valencia, vast rice fields dominate the landscape, creating a veritable carpet of bright green rice shoots in summer that competes in beauty with the nearby deep blue Mediterranean. In the rice fields, stooped laborers shaded from the sun by wide-brimmed straw hats plod the marshy land, and whitewashed, straw-thatched workers' cottages <i>(barracas</i>) dot the rice paddies. The immense lagoon of La Albufera ("little sea" in the Arab tongue) forms the nexus between the swampy rice fields and the Mediterranean; crude, single-sailed sampanlike boats ply the water that is alive with eels, jumping fish, croaking frogs, and aquatic birds. Few sights in Spain rival the splendor and tranquility of a sunset over La Albufera. The Albufera and the rice fields always cast a spell on me; it's as if I have left Spain and entered some magical, exotic land. The bounty of El Levante, showcased at Valencia's enormous central market, would not have been possible without the ingenuity of the Moors, who arrived from North Africa almost thirteen hundred years ago. They created elaborate irrigation systems to channel river water from the mountains that otherwise would be lost to the sea. To this day a water tribunal composed of town elders meets every Thursday morning on the steps of Valencia's cathedral to settle water disputes, and although they are not backed by any legal authority, their decisions are ironclad; there is no higher court of appeal. The Moors also introduced rice, known by its Moorish name, <i>arroz</i>, to the region, as well as saffron (an Arab word that refers to the yellow color saffron gives). All this set the scene for the creation of paella several centuries later. Many paellas are in fact called <i>arroz con</i> (rice with) followed by the names of the key ingredients. Paella bestows an aura on the Valencia region, for it is not merely a regional food specialty but part of the very fiber of Valencian life. It is a diet staple, eaten daily, usually for lunch, themain meal of the day, and occasionally for dinner (Valencians consume more than fifty pounds of rice per person each year). Depending on what is combined with the rice, paella can be a poor man's meal or a deluxe extravaganza. Paella in Valencia simply cannot be surpassed. Although the region's water is not among the tastiest to drink (and just try to rinse the suds from your hair with it), when it is used to cook the rice (or to make broth for the rice), it contributes to a perfect paella. Then there is the rice itself, local varieties that are short grained and low in starch. Particularly outstanding is <i>arroz bomba</i>, a relatively rare rice used by some of the best restaurants, which expands like an accordion when cooked and is unique in texture (to obtain it, see Sources). The region's long tradition of preparing rice has made every Valencian a master of paella. Men who wouldn't dream of entering the kitchen are often in charge of an outdoor paella. There are also authentic paella maestros, known in the region for their superlative skills. These chefs often take their shows on the road, organizing paella fests for hundreds (even thousands), and the entire meal is made in a single paella pan. The <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> lists a paella for fifty thousand people made with ten thousand pounds of rice in a paella pan sixty feet across. Although I did not witness that event, I was present for a paella made for five hundred by my friend Ximo and his son Nacho from La Tasca del Puerto restaurant. Organized in a remote setting in the mountains west of Castell�n de la Plana, it was a lively outdoor summer affair. As impossible as it may seem, the paella was cooked to perfection. So many of my fondest remembrances of Spain are connected to paella, and I am still sometimes surprised at the lengths to which my husband, Luis, and I will go to eat our favorite paellas. We once drove like demons to reach La Tasca del Puerto, portside in Castell�n de la Plana, before dining hours were over because we craved the restaurant's sensational Black Squid Rice. On another occasion we braved a torrential downpour that threatene...</p><h2>Around the World in Eighty Days (Whole Story)</h2><p>The classic story of Phileas Fogg&#39;s eighty-day journey around the world is accompanied by notes and illustrations placing the story in the context of its era</p><p>This edition is printed in specially-designed large type for easier reading, and is printed on non-glare paper.Shocking his stodgy colleagues at the exclusive Reform Club, enigmatic Englishman Phileas Fogg wagers his fortune, undertaking an extraordinary and daring enterprise to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days.

It&#x2019;s a horrible feeling that you don&#x2019;t quite match up, that you&#x2019;re forever falling short, that you&#x2019;ll never live up to others&#x2019; expectations. We&#x2019;ve all faced it, whether it&#x2019;s being last-pick for the softball team at school, being overlooked for a promotion at work, or being excluded from a group of friends. Sometimes the rejection runs even deeper. Feelings of loneliness and inadequacy are hard to handle.<br> The good news is there&#x2019;s a remedy. It&#x2019;s in Jesus Christ, who faced the ultimate rejection and therefore knows how it feels. In bearing our sins, He was rejected by the Father and by us, His own creation, as well. He knows how it hurts.<br> Because He faced that pain, we no longer need to. He&#x2019;s planned another life for us, a life of acceptance in His family and freedom from rejection. Let go of the shame and enjoy the Father&#x2019;s embrace today.</p><p>Rejected No More! Rejection is an all too-common experience, but it can cause permanent spiritual wounds. Author Derek Prince shows how rejection is the root of many problems, such as substance abuse, difficulty with relationships, rebellion, and depression. In our society, millions of people have experienced rejection as a result of...* Divorce* Poverty* Child abuse* Abandonment* Parental neglect* Public humiliation* Unwanted pregnancy* Failure at school or work* Lack of parental affectionGod has made a way to heal your wounds of rejection and bring you into acceptance with Himself and the whole family of God. Discover how to apply God&#39;s Remedy for Rejection to your heart, and you can leave the effects of rejection behind permanently.&#34;He Himself has said, &#39;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&#39;&#34;--Hebrews 13:5 NKJV<b>Derek Prince</b> (1915&#x2013;2003) was born in Bangalore, India, into a British military family. He was educated as a scholar of classical languages at Eton College and Cambridge University in England and later at Hebrew University, Israel. As a student, he was a philosopher and self-proclaimed agnostic. While in the British Medical Corps during World War II, Prince began to study the Bible as a philosophical work. Converted through a powerful encounter with Jesus Christ, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit a few days later. This life-changing experience altered the whole course of his life, which he thereafter devoted to studying and teaching the Bible as the Word of God.<br> Internationally recognized as a Bible scholar and spiritual patriarch, Derek Prince taught and ministered on six continents for more than sixty years. Until a few years before his death at the age of 88, he traveled the world, imparting God&#x2019;s revealed truth, praying for the sick and afflicted, and sharing his prophetic insights into world events in the light of Scripture. He is the author of over eighty books, six hundred audio teachings, and one hundred video teachings, many of which have been translated and published in more than one hundred languages. He pioneered teaching on such groundbreaking themes as generational curses, the biblical significance of Israel, and demonology.<br> Derek Prince Ministries, with its international headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, continues to distribute his teachings and to train missionaries, church leaders, and congregations through its worldwide national offices. It is estimated that Derek Prince&#x2019;s messages have reached more than half the globe through his books, CDs, and daily radio program, which is now known as <i>Derek Prince Legacy Radio</i>. In 2002 he said, &#x201c;It is my desire&#x2014;and I believe the Lord&#x2019;s desire&#x2014;that this ministry continue the work, which God began through me over sixty years ago, until Jesus returns.&#x201d;<br><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Residential Load Calculation Manual</h2><p>Always ships the same day whenever possible.</p><p></p>
